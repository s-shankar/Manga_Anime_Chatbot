    Notice: this review will contain a few spoilers. I'll mark them but if you haven't watched this yet, proceed with caution. Sorry about that.\
Survival games have always been one of my favorite kinds of stories. I just love them. So naturally, when I heard about Mirai Nikki's premise, I was greatly looking forward to it. Unfortunately, after an excellent first episode, this series began to get worse and worse; by the end of it all, it had become nothing but a huge disappointment.\
Let's begin with the positive aspects of this show. The art and animation in Mirai Nikki are, for the most part, rather good,\
          \
        but nothing very impressive. As for character designs, it's pretty hit-and-miss. Some characters look OK, while others are so ridiculous it makes the anime seem/feel less serious than it should be, which is NOT a good thing for a thriller/mystery.\
The music is great. Most of the tracks are somewhat memorable and fit their scenes well. The OPs and EDs are also very nice, with the first OP being particularly awesome. I never skipped them. Voice acting-wise, everyone does a solid, consistent job, except for Yuno's seiyuu. I'm sorry, but her voice was annoying and hearing that infamous \"Yukki!\" every god damn minute was painful.\
Now let's get to the bad stuff. While the premise is amazing, the story & script are very poorly written. Thing is, Mirai Nikki is a shounen trying (and failing) to be a seinen; thus, it lacks the maturity and depth needed to handle the kind of story it offers. Many questions are left unanswered, some of the writing choices are just plain stupid, half of the characters have a very low IQ and, for a mystery, there aren't that many twists, and those the anime DOES have are often predictable.\
The whole concept of using Future Diaries to outsmart opponents in deadly, tense battles is BARELY explored, plus the battles themselves seldom involve complexity. When you've got tools as powerful as those, you'd think there'd be gambits just piling up on each other, but no. Many battles are over within a minute and are so basic it's insulting. Speaking of insulting, this show has a nasty tendency to have its world just forget about some of the big events related to the diary holders. Normally the media would be all over a series of bombings, massacres, etc... but here? Nah, it's just Tuesday again. It's astonishing how everyone can easily get away from anything.\
Another problem with this anime is its bad habit of throwing in bits of humor in the middle of serious moments. It really kills the atmosphere and it's not funny. Even in the more lighthearted scenes it's not funny. Since we're talking about the atmosphere, have I mentioned that some details in crucial moments are overlooked, which obliterates the immersion? Empty hospitals, incompetent cops, silent bystanders...it's the little things that can make or break the mood. A shame, really, because the anime IS able to create a good, creepy atmosphere at times (ex.: the end of episode 3).\
Remember what I said about there being a lot of predictable twists? I kinda lied. The biggest twist in the whole story, which unfolds in the last few episodes, took me by surprise. Did it make sense? Well, yes, at least until the anime began to blatantly make shit up on the spot. Did it answer a few questions? For sure. Did it raise even more questions - most of which remain unanswered - and present to us an INCREDIBLY STUPID twist later? OH YES.\
Now for the worst part of it all. The characters. If you're already angry at me, stop reading because I will not be gentle.\
For starters we have the male protagonist, Yukiteru (or just Yuki). This guy. Let me tell you something about this guy: he might just be one of the worst written characters I have ever seen. No hyperbole there. Not because he's a wimp 95% of the time - I can understand why. No-one normal would stay frosty after being dragged into a survival game full of maniacs. So why is he so bad then? It's because he's absurdly inconsistent. Most selective memory of all time, gullible when not paranoid (never with the correct timing), ability to forgive that defies common sense and, later on, he can't even settle on a personality (which seems to run in the family). Worst part is, his personality shift happens suddenly; he gets almost no development for 18 or so episodes then BAM! complete 180. If you're going to change a character's attitude, make sure it isn't baffling and that it sticks.\
Then we have our female protagonist, Yuno, the main source of yandere-ness, fanservice and body bags. THE poster girl of Mirai Nikki, to the point where she may be more popular than the show itself - just look at how many favorites she has here at MAL. The creator knew of this, so s/he made her the most complex character in the whole cast and genuinely fun to watch. Unfortunately, that complexity only really shows up in the last few episodes, so until then she's pretty much a one note character - crush, kill, Yukki!. Moreover, the yandere trait eventually wears off, meaning she can get kinda annoying afterwards, even with all the carnage she provides. If it cannot wear off for you, then Mirai Nikki will be considerably more entertaining. Either way, Yuno was a hit-or-miss character for me.\
The supporting cast - Yuki's friends and the other diary holders - is where it gets ugly. Out of the former group, the ONLY truly memorable character (and, might I add, one of the few characters in this anime that I liked) is the intelligent Akise. His personality and abilities are a perfect match for this kind of story, which is a shame because he didn't get enough screen time. The other three, despite getting some things accomplished, end up being inept at almost everything, to the point that Akise pretty much has to carry the team.\
As for the other diary holders...just where do I begin? For starters, they're pretty much all insane or very dangerous individuals, except for maybe 2 of them; that alone raises a pretty important question: \"why did Deus even consider letting one of those crazy bastards be his successor?\". Another problem is that some may as well have \"fodder\" written on their foreheads: most don't even last for three episodes, plus they're lucky if they get a mediocre, unpolished back story full of cheap shocks to make you feel bad for them. \
*SPOILERS PRESENT IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPHS* What kills me is that some of the diary holders are such piles of stupid writing it's absurd. I mean, one of them is a 5-year-old kid who's just as messed up as the others, somehow has access to stuff like toxic gas and who can formulate rather elaborate plans. Another is the mama bear of an orphanage composed of people who are willing to erase anyone for her - dressed as ninjas, no less. Yet another is a blind Power Rangers fanatic who dresses up as an eyeball (and who can somehow bring dolls to life. Never explained!) to fight crime. Remember, this anime takes itself seriously.\
There's also the eleventh diary holder, the Hitler wannabe who gave Deus the idea for the diaries. Since the anime never even tries to further explore such an important character, allow me to ask some questions: how did he (or any of the diary holders) meet Deus? Why did Deus even listen to this obviously crazy man? Why future diaries, and not some kind of superpower? By the way, why is Deus decaying? What is MurMur's origin? Why did EVERY ONE of the diary holders only gun for Yuki? The questions pile up fast once the characters are taken into consideration. \
Was there not a single diary holder that I liked? The answer is yes. That would be Minene, the ninth, the series' resident internationally wanted terrorist (at the tender age of 18. Seriously). She was pretty awesome and likable for most of her screen time, which made watching her turn into a textbook tsundere even more painful. And let's not talk about her ABSOLUTELY STUPID role in the final marathon of twists. *SPOILERS END HERE*\
What about enjoyment? Believe me in this one: if you pay attention to the writing, Mirai Nikki will be painful. The mountain of questions, the absurd decisions that some of the characters make, etc...you just won't get a lot of breaks after the first few episodes. So what if you employ the good ol' \"turn off your brain\" strategy? It probably won't be all that enjoyable either. As I've said before, this is a shounen trying to be a seinen. You can just FEEL it try. And fail. I don't know about the rest of you, but that really kills the experience for me.\
In conclusion, Mirai Nikki is a huge disappointment. Its messy story and weak characters are simply not fit for the genre it belongs to. Even if the art was OK, even if the soundtrack was great, even if the anime has its moments and holds the potential to be enjoyable should one ignore the writing issues, it simply does not live up to the hype. I'm probably gonna get lynched by its fanbase; however, I don't really care. I'm done. I needed to get this out of my system, and there it is.\
Thanks for reading this review.\

    This is the first anime review I've ever written, so hopefully everything will turn out ok. Any feed back would be appreciated as long as its constructive ;) \
This review won't contain any spoilers. \
What would you do if you had something that told you the future? If you already had all the answers for an upcoming test, or knew how to avoid bully's on the way home from school? What about if it told you were going to die? \
Mirai Nikki is a brilliant mix of a Psychological Thriller, Action, and Romance. Yuki is a boy who gains the ability to read the future\
          \
        through his personal diary, which is awesome until he finds out that there are 11 other people who also have their own diary's and are his opponents in a competition to become a god. But thats not all bad, he happens to have someone to protect him. Enter Gasai Yuno, a cute girl who goes to Yuki's school. She also has a future diary, and it turns out she has a bit of a crush on Yuki.... and is an insane psychopathic stalker, or Yandere if you will. The story follows these two as they try to survive in the killing game they've been placed in. \
Personally, i think the anime is a 10/10, but for this review i gave it a 9 because of a few small problems in the story. \
Story  9 - The story of Mirai Nikki is at its core a Romance, though its so much more than that as well. It explores how ones actions and willpower can change the future and how good people can do go insane or do terrible things because of traumatic experiences. The pacing is fairly fast, but not forced, even when there's no intense action going on, you find yourself on the edge of your seat knowing that an enemy could pop up at any time. I experienced all sort of emotions throughout the anime, fear, happiness, excitement, sadness.The shock value was insane. My reason for a 9 instead of a 10 was that some of the things that happen in the anime are soo over the top ridiculous and unbelievable that i just couldn't reasonably give it a perfect score and that some of the things that happen in the last few episodes get a bit out of hand, you'll see what i mean when you watch it. \
Art 10 - Don't know what all there is to say about the Art. It's not the best ive ever seen, but there's no problems with it. The action scenes are fast paced and well animated and the characters all look fine. I see no reason to dock an anime points unless the animation is so miserable that it has negative effects my viewing experience, and one of my favorite animes is Berserk, which is terribly animated. \
Sound 10 - The Opening and ending themes are fantastic, and go along perfectly with the anime. The first opening theme is my favorite song of all of them and does a perfect job of maintaining the feel of the anime. The music generally goes very well with the scenes that its played over, especially when Yuno does something awesome. \
Character 10 - I would rate this higher if possible. The characters is where Mirai Nikki truly shines. Yuki is a kind of a wimp who has to rely on others to protect him, and ive seen plenty of people complain about this, but in all honesty i think that makes the anime so much better. He's a 14 year old boy thrown into a battle royal with people trying to kill him, I would probly be a bit of a wimp if that happened to me too.  He's forced to seek aid from and rely on others in order to survive. And he isnt without redeeming moments either.  All the side characters are well developed and have their pasts and motives explained in the story and a few of them are just plain awesome. All that being said, the part of this anime that got me hooked, and the reason its become one of my favorites of all time, is the female lead Gasai Yuno. She's incredibly cute, and incredibly psychopathic, and the perfect yandere. Shes also one of the most unique characters I've ever seen in an anime. Most of the psychological thrills stem from trying to figure out what the heck shes going to do next. At one moment your scared of her, another you can't help but smile at how cute something she does is, then you notice the knife in her hand and your scared of her again. Sometimes you want her to do something insane and at others your shocked about something insane shes doing. She's the selling point on the entire anime for me. \
Enjoyment 10 - I couldn't stop watching Mirai Nikki, i watched it over the span of 2 days. And spent the entire day at work the second day anticipating what would happen in the anime after i got home. I have yet to watch an anime that kept me on the edge of my seat to such an extent as Mirai Nikki.\
Overall 9 - Mirai Nikki is a great and unique story, the characters are excellent especially Yuno, who is one of the most unique characters ive ever seen in an anime. Mirai Nikki is certainly worth giving a shot.\

    I'm going to tell you all a story. Once, there was a man. A man who loved trains. This man loved trains so much that every year or so he would put different things on the train and send it off for other people to see and enjoy. Sometimes he would put fruit on the train, othertimes he would put toys. All to see the end result that his precious train would deliver.\
One day, said man decided to put as many fucked up things that he could find on this train. He put razors, cyanide, bombs, and even decided to mix in some sweet things\
          \
        with all of this, like boxes of sugar and a pink dress fit for a loli. He piled the train up, barely being able to fit in all of this stuff onto it, and set it off - awaiting for the end result.\
Of course, with the train being overloaded with a bunch of different shit on it, it was only natural that the man's train would crash. And crash it did. However, the man did not care. For he would see it that this trainwreck made all the way to its destination, no matter how much shit he had to pull out of his ass to make it work. And so, with everything in the train clashing into one another as the man pulled his own strings to make the train continue going (no matter how much logic it defied in the end) he eventually got the train to reach the end.\
Some people looked at the mess of the train and thought, \"Wow! Look at all of this stuff! There's knives in this train? Stuffed animals? Explosives? Books? How marvelous! What a wonderful thing this train has brought everyone!\" while others looked at the end result and knew right away what a terrible mess all of this stuff was. Rest of the town was too busy watching K-On! to care.\
The moral of the story? When you take as much random crap as you can and load it all into one train, it will crash. And if it crashes you should end it. Oh, and people like trainwrecks.\
If you haven't already voted this unhelpful for the seemingly irrelevant story, I'm here to tell you that this tale was my description of \"Mirai Nikki's\" story - a trainwreck. I won't give you a rundown on what the story is about. You have the synopsis and Google for that, so I'll just get straight to the point. The story doesn't really have any idea where it's going or how it should be directed. They made sure to throw in as many psychotic characters, themes, events and mix it in to be able to attract as many viewers as possible. Seriously, you'll find everything from rape to child abandonment to feeding children grass - all to make the story and characters look like they have depth and the viewer to feel \"cool\" for watching such miscellaneous shit. The transition between events in the story doesn't flow and all seems very random at best. It's as if these events happen just because the plot demands it. \
The story had some strong points - while the fighting scenes didn't always make the most sense or had little to no build-up, they were very entertaining to watch and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested in seeing how it played out. However, the poor writing and lack of common sense in most of the story is what makes it so terrible. The plot loses all of it's purpose by the end of the show as well, which just makes everything worse. It's a good story to be mindlessly entertained, but for those of us who were paying attention you can tell just how often things failed to make sense. It was all driven off of shock value and crazy, psychological things. \
Speaking of crazy, psychological things, let's talk about the characters, or as I like to call them, \"plot devices.\" Each of the character exists only for convenience of the plot and nothing more, and same goes for their past. Every diary holder, save for First & Eight, has something that makes them insane or crazy in some way or another so that way they can serve purpose to the plot. If these characters weren't all deranged or had these insane backstories than they would be of no threat. So why did a bunch of characters with messed up lives get chosen to be diary holders, and then someone like Yuki (I won't focus on the Eighth) who lives a completely normal life gets chosen as well? It doesn't add up.\
As for the characters themselves, Yuki is just a normal guy thrown into a pit of madness. Many hate him, some pity him. Me? I pity the guy. You can't help but look at it realistically - he's a normal kid thrown into this survival game where everyone has some type of mental issue and is out to kill him. This doesn't make his crying and patheticness any less annoying, but it's justifiable. At the same time you can't help but wonder why Yuki was chosen to be a diary holder in the first place considering how out of place he is. Then we have Yuno, the main reason why everyone watches the show. Yandere. That's pretty much her whole personality. (save for her own fucked up past that tries to give her depth and reasoning.) Yuno is like a robot, per say - only programmed when desired to scream \"Yukii!\", act innocent, then kill people. And apparently that sells. She's a selfish, unreasonable character who's popularity is earned from her constant blushing and murdering. While she was indeed suffering from major emotional trauma, none of that justified the actions that she had towards Yuki and the people he cared about. Despite her \"love\" for Yuki, she still constantly hurt him and the friends that he loved - doing what she can to turn him against them instead of letting him be happy with both him AND his friends. She's simply an annoying character with no actual depth or personality.\
As for the other diary holders, they're mostly forgettable and run a cycle of \"appear for a few episodes, fight Yuki/Yuno (mostly Yuno), win, reveal traumatic past, fight Yuno, lose\" and repeat. In short, most of the diary holders were just forgettable and used only for the sake of being killed and adding excitement to the show. Side characters like Yuki's friends (namely Akise) are on-screen more and provide more to the story then even most of the diary holders. That doesn't change the fact that everyone is pretty flat. No real development is given the the majority of our cast. The development that does occur for a few of our characters is written or presented pretty poorly with very little reasons to back it up. I won't say too much as to not spoil the series, though. As I said before, these characters are nothing more then plot devices - created to make the story more \"interesting\" and to shock the viewer into thinking they're looking at an emotionally deep character.\
Artwork is nothing to be fawned over and is mediocre at best. Character designs aren't terrible but they aren't something that I'd call memorable either. The bloodbath scenes are the ones that look the most realistic and it's obvious that the animators took their most time in animating these. The animation is pretty fluid throughout the fighting scenes, but it's an overall forgettable performance save for the blood and gore that they flesh out so well. \
The soundtrack was again, not very memorable, but you can at least say that it stood out. Emotional music fit those so-called \"sad scenes\" pretty well (despite the lack of real feeling in the scenes themselves) and was well-played out. The battle music and of course, suspenseful tracks were also well-fitting and it's easy to say that those tracks were what helped keep you on your toes as to when something may be getting ready to happen. The seiyuu's did a pretty good job considering their roles, but based on a personal experience I can't say that hearing Yuno screaming \"Yuki!\" every episode and listening to Yuki cry every episode didn't get annoying or ear-aching. But overall no real complaints here.\
Did I enjoy \"Mirai Nikki?\" I don't know, do I enjoy not knowing where the hell a story's going? Do I enjoy watching pink-haired girls who only exist for \"love\" do a bunch of random, messed up stuff to everyone every other episode? Do I enjoy trainwrecks? No, I can tell you right now that I don't. The thing that made this show bearable, however, was Minene and Akise, who were probably the two most interesting characters in this show for me. Minene got more screentime then most of the diary holders and was actually tolerable, while Akise held that intelligent personality that always spices up a show for me. Otherwise no, this show held little to no enjoyment for me. Even though I'm a sucker for thrillers if there's nothing to hold it up, not even a simple plot that can be explained in a few words, then I won't enjoy it. \
Overall, \"Mirai Nikki\" left a bitter taste in my mouth. The lack of any reasonable directing - or even reason at all - along with a mix of unlikeable, forgettable plot devices, or as we all call them characters made this show nearly intolerable for me. It took as many different, fucked up things as possible in order to appeal to the general audience, threw in some blood and a horny yandere and viola! A masterpiece! Or so says the people who only look on the outside of the trainwreck. For those of us who are examining this train and everything that actually happened for the end result to be.. this, then you'll be able to see just how terrible \"Mirai Nikki\" actually was.\

    I basically had went to the trouble of signing up an account for myanimelist.com just to write this positive review for Mirai Nikki after watching episode 5.\
Like the synopsis said this is a psychological thriller, with murders, gore, sins and some demented killers.\
However unlike most thrillers the story is extremely good, the characters are all very unique, each with deep, well developed personalities that are slowly revealed to the viewer as they watch more and more episodes of the series. Its a mechanic that makes shows very addictive to watch,  just like how you want to spend more time with your date as they\
          \
        reveal more and more nuggets about their interesting personality.\
Story 10 - Story is amazing, the first 5 to 10 minutes of the first episode was pretty typical, and it was deceiving (in a good way) because the story quickly ramped up and starts to deliver. Every time I watch an episode it delivers something new and unexpected, like a plot twist, or a revelation about the certain existing characters. And every time these plot twists had me wide eyed in pleasant surprise, thinking \"Wow this is so cool!\" or something like \"OMG, holy S*&t! I didn't expect this!\"\
Art 8 - Art is decent i guess, the action sequences are well done, but pale in comparison to this season's \"Guilty Crown\" for action. Overall art is 8 as I compared it with last season's artistic masterpiece \"Hanasaku Iroha\" , which the art was so good for a weekly anime series that I believed it set a new benchmark for artistic quality in weekly anime.\
Sound 8 - The music (OP and ED) are decent, they wisely avoided sound during some of the intense, dark & scary moments where they let the suspense and fear build up in the viewers.\
Characters 10 - Characters are fantastic, awesome for an anime (or manga). Each and every starring character had unique personalities that are uncommon to the typical person. I am only at episode 5 of the anime and I have never seen such a demented and crazy cast. Only the main character Yukiteru-Kun seems the most normal, but even he has his fears and complexes that makes him withdrawn. The best thing about the characters is that the story only reveals small nuggets of their personality and motive every now and then as you keep watching the series. This means that the uniqueness and most likely, the demented craziness of each character drives the storyline further and further as each character's motives are revealed.\
Best thing is that most of the time you don't expect the revelations made about these characters, giving you a \"wow\" moment and surprises you with a plot twist. \
An yea, many reviewers give props to \"Yuno\" the other main character of \"Mirai Nikki\". And I agree, a pretty girl who has a hidden killer personality, stalks the lousiest loser in school like the most diligent killers in slasher movies, and hacks and slashes everyone else with a handaxe. How cool is she! She stays a mystery and keeps viewers wanting to see more and more of her real motives, personality and her backstory.\
Enjoyment 9 - I would give this a 9.5 if they allowed it in the ratings system. After watching 1 episode of \"Mirai Nikki\" at a random anime livestream channel it drove me to find and watch all the other existing episodes and wait fervently for the release of the latest ones. Only thing is that I probably can't have a good appetite while eating and watching this anime, due to the gore :)\
Overall 9 - Again I would give Overall a 9.5 rating if allowed, \"Mirai Nikki\" has a great plot. A psychological thriller with gore is not your typical anime. Most of the time anime makers would turn away from such bloody twisted story for the fear of censorship and lack of young viewers. However \"Mirai Nikki\" is a great watch for anyone above 16. Everybody can enjoy the suspense of a good thriller and be hooked to the various character developments and plot twists. I would easily rate this anime as my choice for anime of the year 2011. Basically if you are even reading this review, find a way to watch the show by any means possible, yes it is that good, enjoy \"Mirai Nikki\" :)\

    This anime is one that has a lot of good surrounding it by word of mouth, and every once in a while you hear someone say it was meh or not worth watching. When I originally watched this, I had only seen the opening and I thought it was amazing and one of the best openings I've ever seen, as I still hold to this idea today. Upon watching the first few episodes, I was intrigued, but not impressed. When I finally finished it, I felt like I had wasted a tremendous amount of time and immediately wrote it off with a one out of\
          \
        ten and rushed a poorly written and bad review of it here, which no longer exists. Then, after many months, I began to think: \"What if it actually wasn't as bad as I initially thought?\" and so I began the perilous quest of rewatching my most hated anime at this current time, and after finishing it, I wrote this review.\
This review takes a bit to get going to my main points, but if you're seriously considering watching this anime, I HIGHLY suggest you finish my review, and then read some other reviews that may/may not be more positive than mine.\
Art: 6/10\
I will start with the art, as this is obviously the first thing you notice. For a 2011 anime, it's definitely up to par and has no really glaring problems, and is actually rather well done. That being said, I have seen much better anime, even in the same year. It also has some CGI, but it's nothing amazing, but it was done tastefully enough that it doesn't seem really awkward or make a bad contrast with the rest of the art. However, a large problem I have with this is if you are watching an uncensored version (AKA Not the TV version) like I had the misfortune of doing, then you will see some anime boobies. This may or may not bother you, but it bothered me as it was unnecessary fan service and it was more creepy and distracting than anything. Why am I mentioning this in the TV version? As a warning to those that there is a difference. The TV version also censors some very odd things, at least to a North American viewer such as myself, like severed limbs. Japan may have some different laws or preferences to us in NA, but it looks really dumb and childish when something like this happens, and it really takes you out of a suspenseful scenario.\
Sound: 8/10\
As I have already stated, the opening is great, and I watch it almost every time. Same goes for the second opening and both endings. I highly enjoy all of these, and they are worth sticking around  for instead of just jumping into the episode or to the next. The background music fits the tone for almost every scene and Tatsuya Kato did a good job in producing it. However, unlike some other music directors, like Hiroyuki Sawano, none of his tracks are very memorable, and so makes the music in the actual anime lacking to an extent, as there was nothing unique or fresh about his style. This is only a real problem for those of us who like anime OST's and will search them up after watching a scene where the song is what really made it for you.\
Story 4/10\
Now this is where my review starts getting negative. If you're a big fan of the show and you don't like constructive criticism, turn away now. The story is about a young boy named Yukiteru Amano who is a very lonely and boring middle school child, who is just going through the motions of life trying not to disturb anyone and only observing the daily events that unfold around him. He himself never takes a large role in anything in his life. The only thing he has to go home to is his imaginary friends, Dues ex Machina, the \"god\" of space and time, and his servant, Mur Mur (Japanese pronunciation Mura Mura, which I much prefer and shall be writing it as such from here on out), who does nothing and a lot of it. One day, Yukiteru wakes up and finds that his diary entries, had already been written for him. Immediately writing it off, he starts his daily routine. Suddenly, the events in his dairy begin to unfold as they were written. Taking advantage of this, he starts utilizing his \"future diary\". However, he is soon approached by a pink haired classmate named Yuno Gasai, who somehow knows what Mura Mura looks like, even though she's just a part of Yukiteru's imagination. Yukiteru is appalled by this, and runs off, only to be continually cut off by Yuno, who then explains to him that there are eleven other diary owners that are all trying to kill each other to become \"god\", as the current one, Deus ex Machina, is dying and needs a suitable replacement in one of these diary holders. Yuno also makes it a point to confess her love for Yukiteru, by showing him her future diary, which tells her everything there is to know about Yukiteru, perfect for a stalker, as she has been doing for the past year. Now, thrust into this game of life and death, Yukiteru, with much help from Yuno, must outwit and outfight his enemies that are the other diary holders.\
Okay, that's the intro. Cue lots of filler and boring episodes where nothing happens, episodes that are really reminiscent of generic \"villain of the week\" shounen anime, and so many plot holes you could sink a ship with them. Upon rewatching this, there were many episodes I skipped because either A: Nothing happens in them, or B: They're just so boring to watch you can't help but skip them. I have so many problems with scenes or ways characters handle things that I could write a spoiled version of this review and it would be twice as long, but I won't. I will just warn you that this anime assumes you're stupid sometimes and creates hype with no build up and no pay off. But let's be honest here. If you have a friend that told you to watch this, but you're not so sure and want to read a review first, there's a reason they wanted you to watch this show...\
Characters 1/10\
Now, for the absolute lowest point of this anime, it's characters. If you're a hardcore fan and decided to still read this review despite my warning, here's where you will be raging. My biggest problem with many shows are weak protagonists. Whether they are just too generic, too perfect, or in this case, too pathetic. Yukiteru, is not a good character. Most anime is marketed towards high schoolers and young adults, hence why most anime is in the Slice of High School Life Rom/Com genre. The reason for this is because if you can have a connection with the characters, you are way more likely to enjoy the show and keep watching. Therefore, when you're mains are all middle schoolers, you can't relate to them as much, or in my case, at all. In a survival game where you have to kill people, I understand why a middle schooler would be hesitant.\
Sake Esuno, the original content creator's solution to this? Yuno Gasai, whose brain doesn't work normally and easily is the first thing that will pop into an otaku's head when they hear the term, \"Yandere\". Yuno murders everyone and anyone who gets in between her and Yukiteru, unless Yukiteru has explicitly told her not to, but occasionally not even then, if she really hates them. While this isn't always a bad thing, listening to a middle school kid cry and scream is not pleasant, even if it's warranted. More on Yuno, she eventually loses all purpose and then begins doing crazy things just to be crazy so that you'll point at the screen, laugh and say, \"Oh that Yuno, always being so nuts!\". This is another part of the \"hype because hype\" driving factor behind some scenarios that ultimately make them blow up in the episodes own face. As for the supporting cast, they are either really well done and don't get enough screen time, or get some but are very obnoxious and you'd just wish they'd go away. Because of this, none of them are worth even mentioning, even though I quite like some of them.\
Overall: 3/10\
I give this anime a three out of ten because I believe it had a ton of potential, but it was only squandered in favor of poor plot devices, lame twists, and boring fillers. An example of this is this anime is way too long. It has 26 episodes, but it could have easily been finished in 20/22, as the last four/five episodes all drag on very long with extraneous scenes. It may have only seemed like this as I have viewed the show before so I know what was going to happen, but I still feel it could have been shortened. Couple this with some episodes that literally have nothing to do with the plot, and you have a lot of wasted screen time, but more importantly, your time.\
Also, a \"spoilerless\" note about the ending, on the topic of tediously long scenes, I have no idea why there is an OVA other than to make viewers scream at their screen until they find out about the OVA, as the Manga ending is literally two pages away from the animes. Keep in mind, a manga page would contain anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute and a half of anime screen time.Sorry, don't mind me. I had to have another tangent, as this anime has given me much to gripe about.\
My final verdict is that this is not worth the watch. However, if, you still decide you wish to view this anime, please watch the subbed version, as the dub for this anime, while not bad, is just wrong, to put bluntly. While the dub voice actors do not do a \"bad\" job per se, I find it vastly inferior to the subbed version, as Tomosa Murata did such a fantastic job as Yuno, even though the character is poor. If you have a thing against subs, I would redirect you here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCEZA_uJCq0 (Trust me, I'm an engineer! There will be no viruses here.) as this is a comparison of the two versions. (Only contains scenes from episodes 1-2)\
As for alternate anime with survival game themes or feels, I redirect you to instead watch Deadman Wonderland. Bear in mind, Deadman also has a whiny protagonist and a mysterious girl that saves him from everything, and that I don't hold this anime in high regards. I would be cautious with watching it, and even though I enjoyed it, I don't think it's all that special or great, but still a better watch than Mirai Nikki, and you'll spend only half the time.\
For an anime that I did like with a survival game feel, I highly HIGHLY recommend Fate/Zero, the prequel to the Fate/Stay Night series. And if the name \"Gen Urobuchi\" means anything to you, and you haven't seen Fate/Zero yet, I really suggest you fix that. And the dub is amazing, by the way.\
Please rate my review as you see fit, and if you have any questions or clarification, please post to my wall, and I will respond when I see it, thanks!\

    You know, having a future diary for myself would have been ideal for my viewing of this anime, so that I would be warned of how nonsensical and down right retarded the anime gets, which is a shame because I happen to have been enjoying the bloody fun so far...\
STORY: Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) is, for lack of a better way to describe it, fucking nuts. A psychogist would be laughing at this mental breakdown of a plot, but I got to be fair, I do enjoy this anime to a certain degree, but it's the crazy sharp turns it loves to take is what\
          \
        nearly throws me off into complete confusion, not the \"I don't understand\" kind of confusion (Though is still includes that from time to time), but the \"Why and how is this happening\" kind.\
However, let's avoid the deep end for now. \
The series is based on a manga of the same name originally created by Esuno Sakae about a battle to the death style of competition between 12 eccentric characters, from a terrorist, to a leader of a cult, to a lovey dovey couple, to even a orphen caretaker for the chance for one of them to take the place of a god, who is literally Deus Ex Machina, before he himself dies. Each will battles each other by using future diaries commonly being in the forms of cellphones, which each one varies on what type of future it fore tells.\
 It's sounds like the love child of series such as Eden of the East and the Fate/ series, though doesn't even get close to them in the intellect or character development department. \
The main character, Yukiteru Amano, holder of the future diary that works as you'd think every other diary holder's would work, is an outstanding leading... total pussy. He is your typical spineless wimp, borderline disgusting even (A kid who would stay behind the sidelines and let the guard dog handle everything as he runs away shamelessly, the hero ladies and gentlemen). From having no friends, to even recording what he does daily in his phone (Pre-future diary), he is the definition of an unlikable main lead, one would or should never root for him, under-dog traits or not, his actions are hardly redeemable, he's easily fooled countless times, and develops at the pace of paint drying on the wall... A wall that is told to pretend his character development... Seriously, he remains the same way until he is told to \"act\" like a badass and and forgets about being a total wimp until later on, but he's my best friend compare to the lead female character.\
Yuno Gasai is what makes this anime surpremely entertaining and utterly batshit insane, this is an arkham asylum of lead character (I honestly believe she'd give the Joker a run for his money), but damn she is just fun to watch, wondering what she will do in the next episode is a one hundred post forum topic in of itself, for good and bad. She is also, for reminder's sake, totally insane and major threat to the cast by her self and a catalyst for the series' plot and character development breakdown. She is hopelssly obsessed with Yukiteru, calling herself his future bride, so she's your classic case of stalker too, but to disturbing lengths. She even goes to far so to kidnap Yukiteru, keeping him tied up, all the while prancing around in her underwear. She is a character that indiscriminately kills anything in her way, she's fun to watch but damn, how can anyone like this character? Especially Yukiteru, which he never can't get his hands washed of her.\
 I know that she's commonly categorized as a \"Yandere\" type character, but that's not a good reason to fawn over a character like her, she's not a character type, she's a damn psychopath with an endless thrist for blood in sheep's clothing.\
But this where I jump right into the twenty feet deep portion of the swimming pool called the \"plot\" where seemingly anything goes, anything no matter how much sense it doesn't make. The future diaries do seem to be too convenient (Which is understandable since each character gets that advantage for themselves), but one of them practibly, or just flat out ruins the anime completely, as everyone seems to be pulling a future diary for their selves at random, and more over a lot of the diaries range from creative to just gimmicky, where the later is more common (Diaries predicting the actions of other couples and one that literally breeds more diaries is just absurd). Even the majority of the cast come down to one trick performances (Or well they only get one try before they're dead and forgotten forever), just a enemy of the week type of formula rules the most of them (And a lot of side characters that don't contribute to anything, like the stout Mur Mur, what is her purpose anyway? Sigh... You will laugh when you find out).\
The anime is indeed addictive, from bloody murders and crazy fallouts from the lead characters, but it's stupidity is overwhelming and just wants to make you tilt your head at the story developments and the absurd character display (Yup, trusting the stalker that just doesn't know how to stop killing everything is the best choice of action Yukiteru, while you're at it, go ahead and hide right behind her back-? You're there already? Then disregard this then and watch your back, like you care pfffth).\
But seriously, the main problem with Mirai Nikki is the inclusion of a character being Deus Ex Machina, it's rare that a story can do this effectively and even rarer for a story to not be confusing nonsensical gibberish, which by the way, Mirai Nikki ends up becoming. The anime is still capable of displaying solid moments with the main couple from time to time, but you'll be far from invested with it as the anime marches forward as it makes up shit as it goes along all the way towards the end. \
ANIMATION: While it's not among the best, it's not terrible either. While the blood bathes in general get the most of the budget for the animation crew, it's overall pretty average, even character designs are pretty regular too outside the quirky ones and the 3d animated god.\
SOUND: Outside of the craziness, the theme music is extremely addictive, with the first opening theme song, Kuusou Mesorogiwi by Yousei Teikoku, being the best. While the performances from the voice actors give off a love and hate vibe, especially where Yukiteru is concerned, his performance only reinforces the pathetic wimp that he is, from whining and freaking out the time... But that's good casting in hindsight (I'm trying to state a positive as a negative, I think this anime is making me crazy...).\
OVERALL:\
The Good:\
+ Great theme music.\
The Mixed:\
+/- Bloody good fun with crazy as all hell characters / When the plot goes off the rails, it's not a pretty trainwreck.\
+/- Creative ways for character to combat each other / Most of which is one time gimmicks.\
+/- Yuno Gasai / The unlikable wimp of a main lead, Yukiteru and Yuno Gasai.\
The Bad:\
- Character development isn't acting like something you're not, which the main proceeds to do so.\
- Towards the end, the story begins to literally make up shit as it goes along.\
It's not okay for people to go \"That just her character type heehee,\" when that character in question is unlikably insane, and it doesn't help when the show is almost a competition to see who's the craziest. An over the top psychotic free for all death match is one thing, but when you start to consider a line getting crossed, that line has already been beaten, stabbed, mutilated and and sculpted into something completely unrecognizable before your consideration begins to come across your mind, that's when it's time to get the fuck out.\

    Mirai Nikki - you won't stop shaking your head.\
Mirai Nikki is a poorly executed show filled with contradictions, illogical character behavior, forced plot advancements, haphazard personality changes, inappropriate scene changes, moronic plot twists, lunatics and most of all: imbeciles.\
The plot is quite simple. The God of Time and Space (Deus Ex Machina) is looking for a successor. Thus, he invites Yukiteru (our male protagonist of this story), Yuno (our female protagonist and Yukiteru's ally/classmate/stalker/girlfriend) and ten others to a battle royal in which the last survivor becomes the new God of Time and Space. While everyone's identity is concealed from each other, Deus Ex Machina\
          \
        declares Yukiteru his favorite to win this death match. Subsequently the other participants decide to focus their attention on Yukiteru. Strangely they are kind enough to stand in line, waiting for their turn to make their appearance. Coincidentally the majority of the contestants are wacky, deranged individuals.\
All contestants are given a \"Future Diary\" (in most cases integrated into their cell phones) which tells about future events as the holder would perceive it, as long as the future doesn't change due to any interfering actions of a diary holder. That means: First, the diaries can be used to change the future, which also automatically rewrites the entries of all Future Diaries. Second, the diaries don't necessarily tell the truth.\
Example: A person holds a coin in his right fist, while his left is empty. Your diary tells you the coin is in his left. You respond accordingly. Without revealing the coin he assures you that your answer is correct, and your diary had predicted your perceived future correctly, even though it was a lie.\
What kind of information those predictions contain is unique to each holder and seems to depend on his job and interests. Best example would be Yuno's diary: As she is quite obsessed with Yukiteru, her diary contains information about his future actions in ten-minute intervals.\
Disadvantage of those diaries is, that damaging them results in the owner's death.\
While the setting of Mirai Nikki had any means to create clever, sinister characters and stories, it turned out to be a badly executed, mindless slaughter show. That is primarily because of the vast number of inept characters and the implausible changes in their personality.\
The average IQ of the cast seems to be crawling around the ten point mark. The plot advances often by exploiting the sheer stupidity of the cast, forcing them to behave in such unrealistic manners that it insults the intelligence of the viewers and ruins even the slightest bit of credibility of the characters as they simply don't act like humans.\
Example: Your friend 'A' is sitting unconscious on a chair, located in a very suspicious-looking room which looks like an obvious trap. Your friend 'B' wants to go into the room to check on 'A', but before going inside, he tells you to stay back and hold the door open. You shout enthusiastically \"Leave it to me!\". Satisfied with your response he goes into the room.\
So, what do you do as a brainy character of this show? Damn right: Ten seconds later you waltz into the room, the door closes behind you, locking you all inside, and you make a face which literally screams \"Oh snap! I totally didn't see that coming!\".\
(While the manga handles this scene slightly differently, it isn't errorless either.)\
The worst thing is, that such irrational behavior is being used all the time for almost every character as if there were no intelligent alternative.\
Adding to the characters' idiocy comes their fluctuating personality changes.\
Yukiteru is an antisocial, gullible, pathetic, insecure, unmotivated, spineless, gutless and brainless teenage boy and Yuno is a crazy, insane maniac with a psychopathic obsession with Yukiteru.\
While the original personality of most of the characters can be accepted by itself, the real problem lies in their unpredictable and unreasonable personality changes - especially those of Yukiteru - making them do the most ridiculous and unbelievable things.\
Turning a coward into a leader-like figure, letting him kill several dozen people with a callous countenance and then, just moments later, turning him back into his coward self, making him sob \"I never wanted to kill anyone!\", is just one example of many baffling personality changes.\
As Mirai Nikki is a show about a tournament in which the winner becomes nothing less than the new God of Time and Space, you would expect that some events had an influence on their surrounding world or that they would carry some other sort of significance. But many events are just swept under the mat, as the characters act like they've never happened in the first place. That is not only due to a poorly written script, but also thanks to absurd and erratic scene changes. The combination of both makes it feel like the viewers are supposed to forget these events, as it seems much more important to see the characters visiting a bridal fair or grabbing boobs in a hot spring.\
While the ending was already predetermined, the rest of the show felt like a messy series of introductions and killing offs of characters. Although some individuals were given a background story, none of them played a significant role or showed any ambition to win this death match. In the end they served no real purpose and were quickly forgotten.\
Animation-wise there is nothing extraordinary to mention. It's pretty much mediocre. The animation shines best when showing one of Yuno's many facets of her going crazy.\
The voice actors fit the cast quite well, the soundtrack is nice to listen to and serves the show as a decent musical accompaniment.\
To sum it up: The combination of lacking intelligence of the cast, the fluctuating, random changes in their behavior, the nonsensical, erratic scene changes and the stolid, rushed plot advancements makes Mirai Nikki an utter disaster.\
While I never take fictional work too seriously, Mirai Nikki's overkill of stupidities made it difficult even for me to enjoy myself.\
Otherwise, I can only recommend this show to people with a predilection for trashy shows as they will most likely have their fun with it.",

    Oct. 9, 2011:\
Mirai Nikki's anime adaptation begins.\
--DEAD END--\
A mess. That's probably the easiest way to describe Mirai Nikki. From beginning to end, it was simply a total mess. The story begins as an apparently simple battle royale between a bunch of varyingly crazy people who can predict the future. By the end it's a dimension-hopping cluster of ridiculous plot twists and some veeeeeeery half-assed writing.\
I wouldn't want to spoil this... unique series for anyone, but I'm just going to say that it involves stuff like one character killing and impersonating herself, a gay guy pooped out by GOD who sends texts while getting his head\
          \
        chopped off (yes, while), and a crazy bitch with a bomb fetish who can fly and has babies that can also fly. Around the final arc it has completely ceased being about the survival game and has degenerated into Dragon Ball Z-style energy beam fighting. Yes, really.\
And, really, most of it comes out of nowhere. Whole plotlines are dropped and brought up very suddenly with alarming frequency. Character arcs are usually resolved in an extremely hasty manner with some form of contrived ass-pull excuse. This is just a very poorly plotted story, not that I've read the manga it's based on. Maybe that fared better? Probably not.\
The protagonist is beta as fuck, too. I sympathised more with the 'villains' (using that term verrrrrry loosely) of the \"Yukki's daddy issues\" arc, as they had a genuinely sad, yet heartwarming backstory. Yukki is just a pussy and Yuno is a crazy bitch who makes no sense half of the time. Best character is Minene, though. She's cool. But her hair in episode 2... honey, no. That look is so not you.\
The nicest thing I can say about Mirai Ball Z is that the opening songs are both fantastic. Particularly Dead END by the lovely Faylan, which I loved before I even started the series. The lyrics don't make any sense at all (The girl with the sharp thorn in her flesh, I met you at your story...?) but it sure is catchy. The first OP with its dramatic choir and counting up in German (EIN ZWEI DREI) was also very memorable.\
It was fun, though. This is the kind of series you make fun of with friends. It was all just so ridiculous and stupid that I couldn't help but kind of like it.\
If you want a solid \"so bad it's good\" series, Mirai Nikki will prolly satisfy your desires.\

    DEAD END. You are facing your inevitable demise. But you possess a Future Diary, allowing you to evade death. However, other holders will be after your life to win Deus Ex Machina's twisted game and to become the next god. But don't worry. Gasai Yuno will protect you...\
Mirai Nikki is an extremely excellent anime that does a fantastic job of incorporating the \"Battle Royale\" atmosphere and creating the perfect yandere. The storyline was complex and well-structured, almost flawless. It does well as a psychological thriller, weaving intense situations and suspenseful moments into an intricate pattern.\
Story (10):\
It is interesting how the director and character designer of\
          \
        Shuffle! were able to string Esuno Sakae's manga into an exceptional storyline. The story itself may sound a bit odd at first (diaries that predict one's future events), but its compelling components such as the prize, becoming a god to replace Deus Ex Machina, the absolute god of time, definitely justify the method of portraying the story in an uncommon manner. With diary holders trying to kill each other in greed for power, the content of Mirai Nikki is dark; much blood and gore is spilled in the survival game. To a person who enjoys \"kill or be killed\" style plots or psychological thrillers, such as myself, Mirai Nikki would be very appealing because of the intense survival game and dramatic focus on the character's mental state rather than the physical world.\
Artwork (8):\
Nothing much needs to be said about the artwork. Although the artwork and animation was good, without anything to complain about, it was not as extravagant as Guilty Crown and not as creative as Bakemonogatari. The animation is violent with much blood and gore spilled; it generally carries a Gothic ambiance of which is fitting for the dark story of Mirai Nikki.\
Sound (8):\
The first opening was fantastic, perfectly fitting the Mirai Nikki atmosphere. There is nothing wrong with the second opening, but I did not think it resonated as well with the anime as the first opening had done. But overall, the OST was great without many complaints.\
Character (10):\
The character development of Mirai Nikki is simply perfect. Gasai Yuno is the perfect yandere without a doubt, holding up an innocent middle-school girl exterior. Amano Yukiteru is portrayed as a weak-willed and timid boy, with a voice actress that accurately represents his personality. Yuno is developed into a psychopathic stalker who becomes obsessed with Yukiteru, stopping at nothing to preserve their \"relationship.\" Yukiteru relies on her protection to stay alive in Deus Ex Machina's game. Yuno is a yandere; Yukiteru is a coward. There is absolutely no flaw in the characters' structure and development in Mirai Nikki.\
Enjoyment (9):\
With people constantly murdering, the little comic relief is enough to release the viewer from the intense buildup, such as the after-credits shorts with Mur-Mur. Generally, the action scenes are exciting but bloody. To some, it may even be nauseating. However, it is definitely enjoyable to one who enjoys these kinds of battles.\
Overall (9):\
I would recommend this to anyone who likes survival games, psychological thrillers, or yandere girls as it is a great anime. But if you want to watch cute shoujo romances, this is definitely one of the farthest things from it.\

    “The best thing about the future is that it comes one day at a time.” - Abraham Lincoln\
“What do you want to be when you grow up?”\
When you're little, have you ever thought about the future? Have you ever wanted to know what it would be like five, ten, or twenty years from now before you grow up? It is probably a thought most of us came upon in our lives. However our protagonist Yukiteru \"Yuki\" Amano is a loner who instead of thinking about the future instead spends his time daily writing a diary on his phone. Talk about a strange habit for a\
          \
        kid without friends. But, surprise will hit him faster than a bullet train when he learns about the future in stored for him.\
Mirai Nikki (also known as The Future Diary based off the manga of the same name), is a story of survival game where the ultimate prize is to become God and given the gift to change the world forever. Being a survival game, it is not complete without its contestants. These contestants known as the Future Diary owners are given diaries in their own form whether it's a cell phone, a sketch book, or a scroll which tell them different things about what will happen in the future. The contestants themselves are also worthy noting that have a wide range of stark personalities ranging from a terrorist, to the devoted collective couple, a child prodigy, and a man who seeks justice in his own unique twisted ways.\
Then, there are the side characters. Yes, I'm talking about those classmates that later enters on into the story. Despite their relatively normal selves, we can see that the survival game later becomes realistic and changes their view on the world. I can't blame them though, I mean who can act and be themselves when you realize that you can see into the future?\
In today's anime series, there are many type of characters. Tsundere, yandere, mysterious, princely, you name it. Then, there is our yandere (hero or anti-hero? you decide) Yuno Gasai. She is described as the typical Yamato Nadeshiko by those who sees her outer self...a girl of perfection who is popular with students, good at academics, and generally an ideal woman. Behind that outer shell however is a girl with insecurities with disturbing stalker-like tendencies for our protaognist, Yuki. Her obssession of Yuki can be labeled as yandere as she is willing to hurt or kill others. In fact, she won't hesitate to sacrifice other people because to her, the only important thing is that she and Yuki survive the game. Her goal of wanting to make that “happy end” (hehe, turn that imagination bulb on) with Yuki is one of the main drives she wishes to achieve in this story.\
Of course with survival game genres, there are consequences such as life and death. In the end, there is only one winner and it's every man for himself. Luckily for our protagonist, his stalker is madly in love with him so that means an alliance. So do the math here: two heads are better than one right? Well, that would be the case but Yuki's insecurities tells him in his mind that killing is wrong and things like this can be ended peacefully. However, in survival games like this, there is no peace. There is no true alliances. There is no true God (yet), no angel, no heaven. There is only blood, betrayals, and power. And in the end, there is only one winner if by miracle that you don't reach your own Dead End first.\
What I found this series quite interesting is that it sticks to the game from the very beginning. Yes, there are those sidelines and mini-fillers (even ones that weren't in the manga) but it sticks with the pace overall. The memories and flashbacks we see of various characters is realistic and the tragedy and mood of what they been through makes them who they are. And of course, there are those fan-service scenes that keeps our eyes glued to the screen involving our yandere Yuno and some other characters. \
As a survival horror, blood and gore is present. What did you expect? This isn't one of those happy love-dovey series involving teenage romance and love triangles. If you want that, go watch Amagami SS or something. Honestly though, I thought that some of the violence is necessary for this series to engineer the reality of the game. In other words, the survival game for the throne of God is real. The contestants are dead serious on winning. And, the consequences for losing are disastrous.\
The show being labeled as a psychological on MAL also shows its colors once the episodes progresses especially later on in the series. Like I mentioned before, there is drama, there is blood spilled, and backs being stabbed metaphorically. The moments are tense and for those who have watched Final Destination or any other related series of related theme would understand this with the thriller-like endings that keeps the viewers at our seats. In other words, it keeps the viewers from predicting what's next and what or when things happen. I mean, it's not like you have a real Future Diary to predict the events of the anime as you watch them. Now, that would be something you don't see every day. \
Another noteworthy mention of Mirai Nikki in my book would be the soundtrack of this series. I'll be honest here. It is epic. The OST mixes in with the various scenes well ranging from psychological, comedic, emotional, and action. Additionally, the OP songs performed by Yousei Teikoku and Faylan portrays the metaphor of the series. If we look carefully and listen to the lyrics, we can see the realism of a survival game and picture it in our minds as the song plays. \
Unfortunately, I found the art of the series to be just average. It's not that unique or something that made me go “wow, I haven't seen something this beautiful before!” I've already had that feeling after watching many Makoto Shinaki films. \
Overall, I would say that this series is enjoyable. It's not just because I'm a sucker for thriller and psychological genre despite some of the fan-service and cliches. Thankfully, Mirai Nikki didn't push that too far even if it did in a few cases. Despite my initial hatred for that excuse of a protagonist by the name of Yuki, I did find his later character development and values to be worth noting. Then, there's the yandere Yuno in the series added in like a little bonus of cherry to a delicious cake. And of course, don't leave the terrorist Uryu out as her character development of the series is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects that makes you want to learn about her more and more. (perhaps even fall in love and marry with her like one of the other characters) The soundtrack is powerful and conveys every moment of the series from emotional, comedy, or thriller. It will keep you at the edge of your seat as you predict what will happen next using your own imaginative diary that's called a brain. Perhaps the only problem I had was with the ending of the anime adaptation. I won't spoil it for you but it's not something I originally hoped to see. With a package of 26 episodes, expect psychological plot twists, character development, and thriller that will make you want more and more. Looking to watch something with your best friend on a weekend after finishing your job or homework? Then, you might of just hit a jackpot because our yandere Yuno will surely give you something to remember by.\

Yandere.\
What in the mighty fuck is a yandere?\
Well, good sir / madam / whoever the fuck you are, a yandere is a common term in otaku fandom, a yandere is a person (usually female) romantically obsessed with someone to the point of using violent means to get them in their arms. Often seen with a sharp weapon and a psychotic grin. Now maybe the most known character to be this type is Kotonoha in School Days since while she’s calm and gentle, she can also be unstable and quite messed up in the head, as the final episode sequence proved that (although that was the\
          \
        only good part about that anime) but enough about that considering this anime I’m about to review also has an yandere character that either has its fans as of recently and it also goes to show you that we need to stray from crazy psychotic girls like Yuno Gasai, Yu no? *rimshot and then gunshot*\
\
High school 2nd year, Amano Yukiteru, is a boy who has problem making friends. He thinks of himself as a bystander and will always write down everything he sees in a cell phone diary. Yuki initially has no desire to win the game, but after Deus informs the other contestants that Yuki, as the “1st” Diary owner, is his favorite to win the game, he is forced to team up with the 2nd Diary owner—his obsessive stalker, Yuno Gasai—in order to survive the constant attempts on his life by the other diary users, who see him as the biggest threat. Tormented by solitude, Yukiteru began to imagine things like a friend called Deus Ex Machina who is apparently the Lord of Time & Space. Seeing Yukiteru’s miserable state, Deus gives him a new ability. His diary will now record events that will happen in the near future. Yukiteru is then forced to participate in a game which the winner will become Deus’ successor.\
\
Well, the plot is precise to mostly the concept of Battle Royale where you better make sure you got the tools and skills to survive whatever gets thrown at you but with the addition of knowing your future beforehand via a future diary but the thing about them is that they’re not exactly 100% reliable as some of them do manage to do the opposite of what the diary predicted and you also know the whole ‘anything can happen if you do the opposite of what the diary said and still might live or not. It’s your choice and all that bunk.’ But as the premise sounds entertaining for a while and it did executed it for a while, it went off the rails and ended up being a trainwreck and it’s not a pretty sight as it’s more of people doing some heinous ridiculous shit that really seems uncalled for. I’ve compared this show to Deadman Wonderland much like I’ve compared This Ugly yet Beautiful World to Mahoromatic and like how I said Mahoromatic is superior to TuyBW, Deadman Wonderland beats out Future Diary by a margin and while Deadman wasn’t exactly a masterpiece, it didn’t felt like it was trying too hard to be mature or a seinen as you will (Although Deadman should’ve been longer than Future). Yeah, there’s blood, gore, gunshots, knives, and tits and ass but it isn’t really trying to tell a mature story; it’s what people said in some professional or amateur reviews, it’s more like a shonen series disguised as a seinen series and we can see through its ruse and not to mention, the tone is inconsistent when it comes to humor, especially at the end of every episode where Murmur (Murmur? Really?), the apprentice to Deus Ex Machina encounters with most of the characters in the show in a comical fashion. I don’t mind it as most characters but it felt very jarring after watching an episode.\
\
Characters are the worst part of the series as I really hated the two main leads, Yuki and Yuno, but more of Yuki than Yuno. Why’s that, you asked? Yeah, Yuno is a crazy pink-haired psycho bitch with the basic traits of being lovingly devoted to Yuki and killing everyone who gets in her way but Yuki…….the guy has some fault in this. This isn’t a trait where the main protagonist isn’t at fault since all the shit that happened, all the stuff that happened to his friends, his family (oh, the hell with his father!! I hate that guy even more!!) Even to some of the competitors, which 3 of them are exactly more interesting than the main two such as The 9th (or Minene Uryū), who actually has more of a compelling background story although she has the textbook tsundere bitch thing going for her and The 7th (or Marco and Ai) and both of them are a better couple than Yuki and Yuno. They’re psychotic and crazy killers but they’re more entertaining and I actually gave a shit about them more.\
\
The animation quality is alright. I really don’t know much about the company, asread, as they do have their own anime productions such as Corpse Party OVAs, Minami-ke, Shuffle among other series they only did some parts of and the look of the show does give out its crazy psychotic vibe and sometimes it get too purple. Yeah, like how K uses blue way too much, Future Diary uses the color purple so much that you think someone splashed Grape Kool-Aid into your eyes and yes, gory shit is happening around these parts.\
\
Music-wise, I think the first opening theme of the show, “Kūsō Mesorogiwi” (空想メソロギヰ) by Yousei Teikoku, is the most positive I can get with the show so far because the song will always be stuck in my head and it does got the destructive and terrifying tone that the show desperately tries to be. The other opening song was good but nothing that really grasp into my mind later on. For ending songs, while I equally like both of them, I’m sliding towards the 2nd ending theme, which is also sung by the 1st opening artist, Yousei Teikoku. Also, can you imagine someone using this song for their own personal life? As for the FUNimation dub, it’s not a bad dub but it just felt wrong and not wrong in the sense of watching the original language is better but I think it’s just the casting choices. Brina Palencia may not have been the right choice for Yuno, but I feel like no one else would’ve done it better than her. She’s acceptable in the role but not really a highlight for her. Josh Grelle is a good voice actor, but him voicing Yuki sounds a bit odd than usual. Rest of the cast does strike more as ‘meh’ choices and I did confuse some voices like how I thought Jamie Marchi voiced Yuki’s mom but it was actually Colleen Clinkenbeard and how I mistake Monica Rial for Murmur when it was Leah Clark.\
\
FINAL VERDICT: Yeah, I hated Future Diary. That’s it. Some people said it was terrible but fun and while that may have a little bit of fun, it doesn’t convince me that it wasn’t entertaining. I hate the main characters and wish some of the supporting characters were treated better than they were in the show and the story is sloppily executed despite me being somewhat interested in it. It is one of those shows you should see once and if you like it, well, good for you but otherwise, avoid this clunker. It is not worth it.\

Ok, right now this show is incredibly overrated, at first I was enjoying it, there is some gore, action, and even some fanservice, but that's about it, because the story is a total mess, it makes no f**king sense at all! There is this God Deus and he is giving cell phones (or future diaries) to some people so they kill each other in a game and the one last standing will become the new God, that's the premise and I know it doesn't sound so bad (it kinda reminds me of Death Note) but things\
          \
        only keep interesting the few first episodes, the rest is just brainless fighting, oh and the characters, OMG, Yukiteru has to be one of the less likeable characters I've seen in my entire life, he's a coward and he's also f**king retarded, for example:\
( SPOILER )\
There's  Yukiteru's loving mother and there's Yukiteru's selfish terrible father, his mother (who has showed love and affection the entire series) is killed by his father, yes his own father kills his mother, and if that's not enough he also tried to kill Yukiterou in exchange of having his debts paid. Ok, here's the problem, Yuki makes more fuss and shed more tears for his father than he did for his mother, it makes no sense, he even was aware of his father's intentions to kill him, and he knew he was the one who killed his mother, but this is Mirai Nikki, the nonsensical anime, so he even forgives him and then he becomes, totally out of the blue, a perfect assassin (he was a coward without combat skills), and all credibility goes downhill from there... \
( END OF SPOILER )\
Yuno is not as bad a character as Yukiteru is, but she's a very shallow character, she's there just for the sake of gore, I think the writers tried to make her a complex character, but they failed, she's also pretty annoying. In some episodes I was like \" I swear, if I hear 'Yuuuukiiii' one more time...\" LOL\
The rest of the characters are even more poorly developed... there's a detective boy who looks exactly like Kaworu Nagisa from Neon Genesis Evangelion, he's supposed to be the mysterious white haired character, and the three friends of Yukiteru, they serve some purpose but there's no deep in their personalities, the same goes for the villains, there's many of them and they look more interesting than the \"good boys\" but they get killed so fast we don't get to really know them at the end, the only exception are the cop and the one-eyed terrorist psycho girl, these two are probably the more likeable characters on the show. Oh and I almost forgot, there's this woman with a HUGE head, she looks so out of place, but no one seems to care \"Hi woman with the huge face\", I know this is anime, it's not supposed to be realistic, but c'mon, she's the only person with such a huge head yet everyone seems oblivious to it (and she's the only character with a huge head). \
As I said the story is a mess, a fan fiction could do better, it's full of ridiculous dialogue and laughable plot twists.\
Sound is average, opening and ending themes are pretty good, the OST it's just ok.\
The art it's not bad, I like the character's designs (especially the character design of the girls), they look a bit generic, but they look great. The animation remains consistently good (just don't expect the quality of Death Note or Code Geass), but it's downgraded in some episodes. If you are expecting a suspenseful psychological thriller, then you may end up very disappointed, Mirai Nikki it's not the next Death Note or Monster, it's all mindless action and nonsense... there's some mystery to the story, but I would rather recommend you to watch Another, it's infinitely more interesting and  mysterious than Mirai Nikki.\
I'm gonna give some credit to Mirai Nikki, the show is a bit addictive, each episode leaves you wanting more, but that's just because they come up with some stupid plot twist that seems interesting at first, but at the end nothing makes sense.\

    Mirai Nikki is disappointing. My review will contain a few little \"spoilers\", though they have little relevance to anything and spoil nothing. This review is kind of a mess and all over the place, much like this series!\
- - - S T O R Y - - - \
Okay, so the story starts off really dark with some creepy kid who avoids making friends. He keeps a daily journal of the things he observes. He likes to spend his spare time sitting alone in his room with a blanket wrapped around himself, where he gets into \"the zone\" and hangs out with his imaginary friends,\
          \
        who are evil gods that have no regard for human life. At this point in the story, it's got you thinking this is pretty twisted and you're wondering what's gonna happen next. \
The basic plot is simple, but effective - kill the other guys before they kill you; the winner becomes the god of space and time. Not knowing the identities of the other people turns it into a sort of psychological game, which makes it more interesting. Now, this was good when the enemies actually desired to become a god, but later in the story, there are characters who don't really care about that. So, you think they'd just stay out of things and keep their identities hidden? Nope! They attack the main characters head on for no apparent reason. \
Anyway, about halfway through the series, it starts to get pretty senseless. Eighth's diary is based on the power of a computer server. Why? They didn't really explain this, so it makes no sense to have an ability like that. I can speculate and say it's because Eighth didn't actually have a diary and that the blog site she hosted allowed other people to write on \"HER\" blog, but c'mon. That's as stupid as saying that the cell phone diaries belong to the phone manufacturers. This part of the story also just really overcomplicates things without making it interesting. It just becomes less interesting as it is nonsensical. \
Yukiteru eventually has a little revelation, causing him to change from a wimp into James Bond. Um... I guess it was cool to have a main character who acted more like a main character, but this was far too sudden and out of character. Akise reveals a \"shocking truth\" about Yuno, which is supposed to be like some ultimate plot twist... except they didn't give us enough clues to make it worth anything when they revealed it. The plot twist only makes sense after you've seen the entire thing, so it um... kinda fails as a plot twist. \
There ends up being some big final battle between two characters that we really didn't get to know or care about. It's a battle with lots of beams and explosions, which uh... seems really out of place. It's like this anime was trying to be too much at once. The last episode doesn't really conclude things, so prepare yourself for some disappointment. \
- - - A R T - - - \
The art was okay, but it seemed a little cheaply animated at times. It seems up to standards, but sometimes it just stuck out to me how the animators looked like they got lazy. \
Somehow, it feels like Yuno was in her underwear too often for no reason. \
- - - S O U N D - - - \
Nothing in particular really stood out. Same high pitched female voices you hear in any other anime. \
- - - C H A R A C T E R S - - - \
Oh boy, here we go. \
Yukiteru - He starts of being some creepy kid like I mentioned earlier. This was interesting. He's kinda wussy, like any average 12 year old boy would be, but he's not unlikeable. It took him a while to realize how he felt about Yuno, but it was good to see the progress - it made it believable. His character does a sudden 180 later in the story. This kinda ruins his character since there was no real development leading up to that and no real development afterwards; he was just suddenly a completely different person. This was disappointing.\
Yuno - She's a \"stalker\", which um... is a weird concept in itself. When you think of a stalker, you think of a 50 year old pedophile or something. In Japan, for some reason, I guess they consider kids and teenagers \"stalkers\" if they watch the person they have a crush on. Anyway, Yuno is supposed to be some psychopath who can only be tamed by Yukiteru's love. Can he help her calm down and give up her lunatic ways? Find out next episode!\
It was fine that way. We could see their relationship develop. Then at the peak of Yukiteru's love and trust in Yuno, the writers thought they'd give us a plot twist? It was one of the stupidest plot twists I've ever seen. It ruined Yuno's credibility as a character and was just... why? What was the point? It made no sense at all for that to happen. They had what they wanted, so why the fuck would things downgrade to the point that their relationship might as well have never existed? They should've stuck to building her up into a respectable character instead of um... ruining the entire series. This was disappointing.\
Eighth - What the fuck is she? Seriously. Her existence simply does not make sense. She is a chibi middle aged woman who is also gigantic. She is clearly not human, but nobody cares. \
Eighth's Lucky Star apprentice girl - She was part of the Sacred Eye cult, then she became a member of Eighth's orphanage. In world 3, she is simply with Eighth, though. What a plot hole. \
Akise - He's pretty much the only cool character. However, he is gay and kisses Yukiteru for no reason. Was that supposed to be a plot twist? I don't even know anymore...\
Ninth - She's kinda stupid. She introduces herself in some kinda Victorian dress and big poofy pigtails, yet she's supposed to be some terrorist who specializes in explosives. She's loud and pretends to act a little crazy. She falls in love with the person she thought she killed, she becomes friends with the person who destroys her eye, and she plays a big plot hole role later in the story. This was disappointing.\
- - - E N J O Y M E N T - - - \
The plot was really enjoyable at first... y'know, before they butchered it. There was some mild fanservice, which we easily could've lived without. It was a strange kind of fanservice, though. Yuno's swimsuit falling off and floating gently down the stream? A pretty typical occurrence that happens to every anime girl at least once in her life, right? Instead of making her panic and bounce all over, instead of making her use this to seduce Yukiteru, instead of drawing her looking like she's ready to be raped... they honestly made it a pretty modest event. Yukiteru also accidentally pulls a girl's pants down, exposing her underwear, but they didn't draw the girl to look sexy or anything. She was simply a girl with her underwear exposed. These scenes were 100% unnecessary and added nothing, of course, but I was glad that they didn't try to make it look like hentai. \
There are also 2 rape scenes and 1 sex scene, but they leave it entirely up to your imagination instead of making it really graphic. Again, I'm glad they didn't try to make it look like hentai. People can watch porn on their own time; it has no place in telling a story, and I can respect that this anime didn't ruin itself with that. However, I have to say that using rape in a story is pretty tasteless, lazy, and overdone. Getting to know the backstories of these characters, becoming a little emotionally invested in them, then they just have something like that happen to them... it's just a disgusting thought. I can understand if they wanted to make the characters tragic or like we could know more about them by seeing their hardships, but rape is just kinda crossing the line. It's not interesting and it's too harsh for simple entertainment. \
I think the two most interesting things in the anime are the relationship Yuno and Yukiteru develop (before the retarded plot twist kicks in) and the betrayals. This anime has a lot of thrilling betrayals in the first half. The ones in the later half are kinda boring since you don't get setup to believe in the trust the characters share.\
- - - O V E R A L L - - - \
This had a lot of potential to be good. It's really disappointing they ruined it with all those inconsistent and random ideas. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, really, as it is just a big let down. If I knew ahead of time that the story was gonna go downhill so badly, I don't think I would've watched it.\

    Mirai Nikki (or Future Diary as it is known in English) is one of the most popular anime to come out in recent years along with Sword Art Online and Attack on Titan and much like those shows, it has divided the anime community into two camps, those who love it unconditionally and those who hate it with a burning passion, which results in a slew of insults complete with poor spelling and grammar being thrown around forums and comment sections. Now that I’ve got this little bit of superfluous information out of the way, you probably want to know what I think about the\
          \
        show. Well, that is the purpose of this review (obviously).\
\
I’m just going to start off by saying that it is quite silly. Don’t get me wrong and start attacking my page, because “silly” doesn’t always equate to “bad” (case in point Gurren Lagann is one of my favourite anime of all time). But keep in mind that I didn’t say that the particular brand of silly is awesome. The premise is actually bloody interesting. It revolves around several people in a battle royale where the winner becomes the god of time and space and they are all equipped with supernatural cellphones that can tell the future (also known as “future diaries”, hence the show’s title) which they use to their advantage. A large perk of a premise like this is that it is perfect for setting up plot twists and for creating tension. Boy does the show use this to its advantage. Alliances are forged and broken by betrayal, good guys turn out to be bad guys and major characters are killed off. This makes the show unpredictable which we can all agree is a good thing.  It also places a lot of focus on the side characters as well as the main characters as they off each other and help each other out so it feels more authentic than a lot of other survival game stories where the side characters are all placed in line for our protagonist to fight.\
 I am now going to address what I said earlier about the show being silly. It is over the top. And trust me, that is an understatement. Homicidal five year olds, zombies, the god of space and time (Deus Ex Machina) and the list goes on. Don’t get me wrong there is nothing wrong with being over the top to a certain extent (I love the Sin City graphic novels for crying out loud!) but there are times when the show tries way too hard and certain things just don’t fit to the point where you get the impression that the show doesn’t know what it wants to be. The show wants you to believe it is a dark psychological action/thriller. There are times when the over the top nature works in its favour, for example I thought the addition of zombies and a crazy religious cult added to the cool factor of the show as well as setting up entertaining action scenes (because honestly who doesn’t want to see a cute pink haired yandere fight zombies with a goddamn axe) but there were times when I felt like the show was saying “Oooh, we’re super dark and edgy because we have a five year old psychopath” and this gave me the feeling that they were trying too hard and made it seem quite stupid. And when you’ve added a character with an army of robot dogs, it stops being simply stupid and becomes fucking childish. Stuff like this prevents you from taking it seriously when the show obviously wants you to.  That being said, the show was rather entertaining. Like I said earlier, it is quite unpredictable and has a certain cool factor. However the things I mentioned did hinder my enjoyment, which is quite a sad thing.\
The characters are without a doubt the weakest part of the show and were what held it back the most. First off there’s fourteen year old Yukiteiru Amano, or Yukki as he is often referred to. He’s our protagonist. Yukki is dragged into the game by his friend Deus Ex (the god of space and time and the guy who started this competition) who Yukki had thought was his imaginary friend up until that point. Yeah, this fourteen year old boy has a fucking imaginary friend. Yeah that’s right, he’s a fucking loser! To further emphasize this point, before being dragged into this little game his only hobbies were recording mundane shit on his phone and unenthusiastically throwing darts (a feat which comes to his advantage later). But what’s he like? Well calm down and I’ll tell you. He’s a pussy. He cowers, cries and whimpers throughout the majority of the series making the viewer want to jam a screwdriver though his skull. “But dude, you have Shinji Ikari in your favourites, you’re contradicting yourself you biased prick!” is what some of you might be thinking right now. Well, Shinji is realistic and that’s the reason I like him. Yukki pushes this angst and wimpiness to the point where it’s not credible and exaggerated wimpiness is not something an average viewer would find appealing. I love Kamina from Gurren Lagann for his exaggerated manliness but that is an appealing characteristic in a protagonist. I guess the writer thought to himself “I’ll be different and put a scared kid in the role of the protagonist instead of the generic righteous leader type we’re so used to in these types of stories”. This would have been a really good idea if he was given more complexity than just “being a pussy” and if he were given a reason for being a pussy. A good example is the aforementioned Shinji Ikari. He’s an interesting and well thought out character that has layers (insert Shrek joke here).  He also has good reason for being the way he is. His father treats him like shit and his mother died under dreadful circumstances when he was very young and to top that all off he’s forced into a situation that he knows fuck all about by his father. Yukki on the other hand grew up with a really chilled mom and an initially awesome dad (SPOILER: becomes a cunt later in the series) and his situation is nowhere near as bad as Shinji’s. And besides, Yukki makes Shinji look like Kenshiro on steroids.  One Youtube anime reviewer referred to him as Noodledick Vaginasaurus and I can see why. He is without a doubt one of the worst protagonists I have ever seen. Towards the end of the series they try to make him seem like a badass but this drastic change feels really sudden and he doesn’t stay that way for very long so his character becomes very inconsistent. \
The next character that I’m going to talk about is the character everyone thinks of when this series is brought up. Yes, the one and only Gasai Yuno. She’s become one of the most popular and iconic anime characters in recent years as well as the waifu of many lonely weeaboos. She is a psychopath who falls in love with good old Noodledick to the point where she is dangerously obsessed. She is also a contender in the survival game and is on Yukki’s side and she protects his useless ass from the other contestants. She flips between being a cute naïve teenage girl to being an all out psycho at the drop of the hat and these changes are unexpected and the transition is great. This genuinely creeps out the viewer and the fact that it can happen so suddenly adds to the sense of unpredictability that I mentioned earlier. She’s a fun character to watch too. Her insanity paired with her cuteness gives her a certain bizarre charm.  However, as fun as she is, she is definitely not flawless.  She’s ultimately just an archetype (that archetype being yandere) and this is a bit disheartening as it tells you that the writers were being lazy and just decided to use a simple, set archetype instead of adding more to said archetype. Another issue I had which was very much subjective was that she called out the protagonist’s name constantly throughout in a high pitched tone of voice. This was cute and pretty creepy the first couple of times but it got to a point where I felt like shoving screwdrivers in my fucking ears.  She’s a really enjoyable yet problematic character who is frankly a tad overrated.\
Now for the rest of this show’s cast. Unfortunately they’re the show’s worst flaw in my humble opinion. A lot of them are copied and pasted from other, better shows (we’ve got Kaworu and Revy here), are given less screen time than they deserve, feel like they don’t belong in this sort of show, have REALLY overblown backstories and for the most part they don’t behave in a believable way (dude, one doesn’t become someone’s close friend in three minutes). \
Now let’s delve into the show’s art. It’s not spectacular but it’s definitely not bad. I particularly liked the depth and detail they gave the eyes of the characters and the scenes in Deus Ex’s world which had a really dreamlike quality due to all the purple used. The overall designs of the characters are standard fare and there is nothing about them that really stands out as being really good or really bad, with the exception of Deus who has the misfortune of being done in shitty CG. \
The same can be said about the show’s soundtrack. It does its job sufficiently enough but when I think back there were no tracks that really stood out. The same can’t be said about the show’s OP tracks though. The show’s first opening is without a shred of doubt one of the greatest of all time. The contrasting red and whites and the song’s fast pace and grand scale are enough to send chills down one’s spine. The second opening is memorable for a different reason though.  It’s in FUCKING ENGRISH and it is therefore goddamn hilarious.\
In conclusion Mirai Nikki isn’t the deep mature thriller its fanbase make it out to be but it certainly isn’t the harbinger of anime’s decay like many critics would have you believe. Granted it can get REALLY fucking stupid but it can also be a ton of fun at times too. Whether I’d recommend this show or not doesn’t matter because you’ll probably watch it regardless due to its immense popularity. Since I’m more or less impartial to the show it’s not something I’d recommend but at the same time it’s not something I’d tell people to stay away from. So that about wraps up my review. Sayonara suckers. \
Feedback would be much appreciated.\

1. This review is probably as crazy as Future Diary the show itself.\
2. There are little to no spoilers in this show, and should not ruin your viewing pleasure of Future Diary even if you have not watched the show when going through this review (There will be brief mentioning about some characters that might be minor SPOILER of the story!) .\
\"Irresponsibility is part of the pleasure of all art; it is the part the schools cannot recognize.\" ~ James Joyce\
Future Diary is art.\
And I am not even kidding.\
Future Diary should be clear to any potential viewer that it is yet another one of\
          \
        those Battle Royale-style story, in which there will be a bunch of high school kids and throw them into a situation where they have to pit off against one another (alright, I am oversimplification of things in Future Diary, but you get the idea). Such story should not be foreign to most people, seeing the popularity of similar plot in popular western franchise such as the Hunger Games, as well as in Japan, such as the Zero Escape or Fate franchise. Many people was sold on the idea that Future Diary is going to be a thought-provoking psychological thriller that blows their mind, only to have all their expectation thrown out, getting a seemingly incomprehensible mess that was far from what they actually expected. It is very much due to this that many viewers develop a distaste for Future Diary. \
Many people have used the term 'trainwreck' to describe the final outcome of this show, but I personally think that that is too demeaning of a term to be used on Future Diary. Simply said, the sheer craziness of Future Diary can't just be contained within a train (or 2 or 10 or 10,000 for that matter). Future Diary may be an incoherent mess, totally illogical, with the story flowing through by any means but with a constant flow. If the thought of the aforementioned turns you off, then Future Diary is definitely not a show for you. And there really isn't much point for you in continuing this review. Of course unless you are interested in knowing why Future Diary is an art, then welcome on-board the train. You still with me? Good, let me convince you why this mess is absolutely wonderful (Allow me to articulate this clearly, this review is not a piece of satire).\
Let me first talk about what I deemed as one of the best part of the story: the twist, oh the plot twist, hail them. The \"deus ex machina\" (the plot device, not the character) present in this show is often subjected to multiple criticisms by critics and reviewers alike. Not only do the twists seems absolutely nonsensical and bonkers at times, they only further elevate the amount of questioning in the show. Future Diary is absurd and ludicrous to the core, do not expect good logical flow in the story. This again, is what makes Future Diary so amazing: the roller coaster ride of events after events to an unthinkable extent, logic simply does not exist.\
Allow me to put it this way: both the original mangaka (Sakae Esuno-sensei) and the staff are an irresponsible bunch. They couldn't care for the logic in this show (if they even care for it in the first place). However, it is also precisely due to this that Future Diary could be successful in the first place. The people working on this show knows what Future Diary lacks (logic) and at the same time is clear of its strength (the absurdity). The ridiculous pacing turns away most of the viewers, but this perhaps really just highlighted the greatness of this show. It just gives you this crazy adrenaline pump to continue watching. It spends little to absolutely no time to explaining the illogical stuffs (For a couple of reasons, such as too many of them, inability to explain, or as I see it, unnecessary in this crazy show) and will just let the next major event before the viewer can even take a breather. This is why, the very essence, the heart, the core, of Future Diary would be these insane and out-of-mind plot points. You expect it to come, it had being foreshadowed all the way from the beginning, you are waiting for it to happen, yet you just could not pinpoint what exactly and when exactly it will occur, and you will get completely overwhelmed by it why it comes (in both a good or bad way). \
The following point will unfortunately incorporate my arguments made for the story relatively closely, and that is the characters in the show. Once again, if you are looking for well fleshed-out characters in this show, sorry but there really isn't any. While most of the characters do get a backstory explaining their course of action (of course, the stories being totally illogical), their presence is merely a fodder for the story to progress, and not as a being that drives a story forward. If there were any characters that I might want to focus on, that would be the main characters Yukiteru (Yuki for the rest of the review) and Yuno. Yuki is the wimpy, ain't-getting-anything-done protagonist that just unfortunately generate lots of hate among the viewers. From his character design of wearing a abnormal hat to his every action in the show, it just screams \"weak\". It is no doubt irritating to see the main protagonist not doing anything. Personally, while I am no fan of him, the hate generated due to him seems quite unreasonable (Oh my, I'm talking about reasons in Future Diary). Come on guys, he's a kid thrown into crazy stuff that he could not even imagine, forcing him into all these crazy stuff just seemed all the more nonsensical (now I'm talking \"sense\", welp!). This is more so ridiculous in the presence of the all-powerful girlfriend, Yuno. Yuno is totally bonkers, crazy, because as if I need to reiterate that. Disturbing staring of the eyes and pink hair in the air every time she swings her axe, she is probably the poster image for a psychopath in anime. However, if there were any character, it was her that keeps the show going. Her absurd antics to win Yuki over and have him accept her, the preposterous acts against the other diary holders, it was almost entertainment at its finest. And for her to keep this momentum going... she is definitely not any great protagonist by any means, but there will be no doubt in her being one of the most memorable one. Now, you combine the wimpy kid and the dominating queen, a weird and illogical combination, but it is this dynamics that drive the show and further heightens the general atmosphere. \
Regarding stuffs such as animation and sound, I really doubt that there is much to talk about. I do want to praise the first opening theme (\"Kuusou Mesorogiwi\" by Yousei Teikoku) for the mysterious-chant at the start of the song to hype the viewer up each time, as well as the crazy amount of foreshadowing in the sequence. The rest of the theme songs and decent though nothing especially great. The voice acting, well, having the voice actors shouting and screaming around doing what they usually don't is always entertaining. Animation, by Studio Asread, is nothing amazing though nothing much to criticise on as well. Fight sequence are generally well-animated well the more \"daily\" scenes have a lower animation quality, which I personally do not mind and has no qualm with.\
I genuinely enjoys Future Diary. If I had any reason for such, here is my hypothesis (feel free to skip it): The fruit of wisdom had let mankind gain the ability to question, and thus quench the thirst of knowledge. Future Diary, (un)fortunately, leaves the viewer with an insurmountable number of questions, completely perplexed at what they had seen. But does it matter? I do not think so. While logical thought process is important, humans still could not escape the control of emotion, the illogical side of every human being. Perhaps, really, nothing could top Future Diary in this domain. Anything can happen. The madness and lunacy just snowballs throughout the whole show without a stop. It is a spot-on hit on the illogical side of human, something that targets the hysteria and psychopathic side of mankind. You know that something stupid is going to happen, yet you will (not) advance. You want to see how Future Diary's absurdity can top itself every single episode. It is this pulpiness and the juiciness in Future Diary that just make it more so interesting. This is not something that an institution which favours logical thinking will be pleased with. Future Diary really is something that appeals to the more inhumane side of human, the illogical and overly-emotional aspect. To phrase it in another way, Future Diary is not (supposed to be) a critic's favourite. If you are only going to favour the logical aspect of the show, something that is absolutely missing in Future Diary, then it is anything but hard for one to slap a 4/10 or 3/10 onto this show and criticise every single plot point in this show. However, Future Diary is those show that should be judged by upon anything but the logical flow of thoughts in the show (because it does not exist). If anything, Future Diary appeals to that emotional and illogical side of human. If anyone is going to ask me why didn't I rate Future Diary a 10/10, I would pretty much just answer that there is this little bit of sanity and logical flow left in me that simply could not ignore the flaws in Future Diary (Come on now, what I am trying to say is not that people who criticise this show are emotionless creatures and that everyone that gives this show a 10/10 is a psychopath). I am in the opinion that Future Diary is no doubt one of the more controversial and subjective show that anyone will see in a long time. The way how Future Diary commits to bringing entertainment than to explaining logic makes it stand out from the crowd. The fact that it does not bind itself to the usual structure of what to expect from fiction just makes it all the more so enjoyable. I definitely do hope that more people can appreciate and recognize it. \
And so, with that, I conclude the reasons of why do I think that Future Diary is quite a piece of \"art\", although definitely not one that everyone can appreciate equally.\
Let me touch on one more point before rounding this off. Some people have suggest that Future Diary as a satirical masterpiece, a deconstruction of the logic in story, magical girlfriend, deus ex machina etc. (to prevent spoiling) trope. Personally, this is not something that I will concur with, but seems interesting of an idea that I would brought it up, and would actually be a great explanation to everything that happened in this show. However, I still  prefer to keep my opinion of Future Diary as just a crazy batshit show without overthinking it too much, but hey, it's an interesting opinion. \
Some of my points may be indeed controversial here, but I do want to talk about my opinions of this show. Not everyone will enjoy this show, definitely, and even when on the same point, could have differing opinions. So, yeah, I kinda got what I wanted to talk about Future Diary here.\
Well, looks like I got side-tracked a little, pretty irresponsible...\
Damn.\
What a fine piece of art I am.\

    Just your average-everyday anime-viewer here, with another review!\
As any accustomed anime-viewer on the internet and surfing about in the vast corners of the ever expanding sea of information (or in my case, the shallow waters of 9GAG), then you have probably already heard of what could really be considered as the birthplace to \"The Original Overly Attached Girlfriend\", or at least by the anime community. I am of course referring to Yuno. Booting up the first episode and having quite a few expectations as to what I am about to witness, not only were they confirmed but actually exceeded these expectiations quite exceptionally. But (yes,\
          \
        there's a butt), as this show is highly claimed to be one of the better horror, gore and phsycological anime out there, which I totally agree on, there are a few flaws that just needs to be adressed. And now, I can already feel that DEAD END coming for the button \"Not Helpful\" by mobs of people who are sharpening their pitchforks and lightening the bonfires. In this case, the Mirai Nikki fanbase...\
Before reading on, this review is spoiler-free, so don't worry should you want to watch this show after reading the review. I take it that you've read the synopsis yourself and maybe even watched the show. This review also comes with a TL;DR section as well as a few additional details, right at the bottom before the conclusion.\
The Story: 9/10\
With a premise of a Deathgame (one that we should be quite used to after this, Deadman Wonderland and many others, including The Hunger Games), this one actually has the most interesting twist to the game, or at least in my humble opinion (IMHO). In the beginning of the show, everything we need to know is covered, nothing more and nothing less, leaving what will actually happen in the game itself very vague and up for the imagination to come up with how they will execute the plot (and players). This is crucial, as this leaves an exciting and often curious mind-set into each and every episodes, which however lasts only in the first few episodes. They show us these few episodes and the set-up quite remarkably fast and informative. Then, the show divides itself up in different parts where Yuuki and co. has to kill (or something else) the player of the episode. Or rather, episodes. Here lies one of the problems I metioned in the beginning. While the player-arcs are interesting, thrilling and a treat to watch, other arcs feel emptier. Not by means of action and excitement but BECAUSE of the player-arcs, they seem insignificant even though they are not. Towards the end, everything connects and starts to conclude the series when you suddenly remember that one thing from the second or third episode and realise that there's three more episodes left. I'm not saying that the ending was bad, but if it was something I want to adress to the ending, it was that urge and need to stand out, and therefore, it felt rushed and incomplete. Mirai Nikki, you already stand out in terms of storytelling, execution and characters. C'mon, you're better than that. But, it still leaves with a hail-mary and a strong, solid exit (as long as you see the OVA: Mirai Nikki Redial).\
The Art: 8/10\
One thing I immediately think of when referring to the art of Mirai Nikki is its great crispness of details and actual emotions & distress (and on multiple occasions, Yuno's absolute horrifying expressions she can make) that they manage to display to us. Blood and action is basically the name of the game here and it is where Mirai Nikki truly shines, with progression through aggression. Action-scenes are a feast for the eyes and every action counts, every DEAD END significant and every death remarkable. It blends extremely well with the tone of the show and even parts that aren't that common in anime makes great usage here. And by that, I mean how they use 3D models. Sure, 3D-models shouldn't really be used unless with absolute necessity but they managed to pull it of here. And after all this praising and telling how good it was, I gotta tell ya, it doesn't stand out. For a thriller, the colours are warmer than most other thrillers out there, but can get to those levels when the plot requires it to be so or under heavy rain (...). But still, it passes with flying colours and there shouldn't be any complaints here, but neither should there be excessive amounts of praise. Have to balance out...\
The Sound: 8/10\
I'll start off the same way an episode of a usual anime starts, with the OP. Having two OPs, the first one being \"Kūsō Mythology\" performed by Yōsei Teikoku is one that not only reflects the anime brutally perfect within the one-and-a-half-minute it is on air, but also sticks on your mind during the episode and after it as well. And as they usually do, they replace it halfways. Compared to the first, \"Dead End\" by Faylan has nothing on OP1. Inside the episode, the music amplifies the scenes complimentary with great effect, but only the heavy action scenes and the rare \"feels-scenes\". Here lies another problem, as great as they are, none are rememberable and are used a few more times than I wanted. Still, I find Mirai Nikki having great pieces of music that fit well with the show but not outside of it.\
The Characters: 9/10\
We've got the coward, Yuuki. We've got the mad one, Yuno. And we've got a heck of other characters where we do not know who to care enough of shit about. Don't get me wrong, the cop and the girl who can escape from anything are interesting characters and have an interesting backstory to boot. But what about the other characters? Is a two-minute explanation of a players motives good enough? Here, they can variey, as all characters are unique and have unique motivations along with unique diaries. Then there are the side-characters, who the series try their very, very best to make us give an actual fuck about and even made one of them important! All I'm saying is that there are many great characters, add on a few characters where we kinda give a fuck about and a handful of which we give absolutely no fuck about. The problem lies within the amount and significance ratio between them and spread butter evenly on a 24-sliced loaf and some characters will have more fucks deserved and a few lesser than they need. And you only have so much fucks to give...\
But, all the significant characters are interesting, have actual human thoughts and reasons (excluding Yuno or others when thinking about it...) and their reactions and emotions feels real (excluding Yuno at certain times...).\
My Enjoyment: 10/10\
It was a fun ride, and with that 26-episode mark, a rewatch was all worth it. I give 10/10 here and I have nothing more to say other than that I really enjoyed this show despite its flaws that comes along with it.\
How it was Overall: 8.8/10\
By no means is this the best show ever, trust me. But it is a fantastic show that has the stamp of a \"Must Watch\" on it and it is a perfect addition to my (and hopefully yours) ever expanding library of anime. Having one of the craziest lunatics in anime-history, Yuno will kill you if you don't watch this anime and enjoy it to a certain extent. If not Yuno, then the Mirai Nikki fanbase. This show has hype, and most of it is well deserved :)\
TL;DR\
Story:\
+ Original Deathgame\
+/- Great pacing at certain parts, downright wrong in others\
+ Every action and death has impact\
+/- Twisted but strong ending (remember to watch the OVA)\
Art:\
+ Great detail and overall animation\
+ Action-scenes are the best\
+/- Doesn't have that kind of dark-tone that thrillers usually have, but it's good enough\
Sound:\
+ Awesome OP1\
- Replaced halfway by a comparably worse OP2\
+ Great overall background music that amplifies the show well\
+/- No rememberable pieces\
+/- Set on repeat\
Characters:\
+ Great main-characters\
+ Interesting and diverse player-characters\
+/- A tap too many characters\
+/- The side characters overall\
+ Most characters have real human emotions and reasons\
Enjoyment:\
+ Worth it\
+ Must see\
+ That urge to watch another episode is strong on this one\
Additional Details:\
* Romance: Well, not your average kind of romance...\
* Gore & Blood: Excessive amounts, but used sparingly\
* Comedic Add-ons: Rare and often not noticable\
* Feel-warning?: You could say that towards the ending\
* Fan-service?: In small amounts, nothing that'll bother you enough to ruin the show\
Well, if you've managed to get this far without immediately gotten a DEAD END on your phone or just headed straight for the \"Not Helpful\" button after having read the intro to this review, I would like to thank you for your time spent on reading this review by basically the most pathetic, average, no-life of an anime-viewer that I am...just like Yuuki :)\
So, smack that \"Helpful\" button for me (or Yuno, whatever you prefer) and leave a comment so I can make better reviews that might fit your taste better :)\

    You know that guy at school that thinks they know more than what they actually do? It’s that person full of overblown confidence, walks around with that air of superiority and tries their best to act above their age. Mirai Nikki is that in anime form. When you search deeper, going beyond just the looks, and actually ask questions of them they fall apart. You realise it’s all one big ruse. I kind of want to pat Mirai Nikki on the head and make it feel better about itself. “That’s so cute. You tried to be a seinen” I’d say with a tear in my\
          \
        eye. It takes a death game and approaches it with reckless immaturity in its themes and its writing. Any tension that should be there doesn’t exist because of that and not even an interesting conclusion could save it. \
Mirai Nikki (aka Future Diary) tells the story of twelve contestants trying to become the next god of time and space in a death game where each individual can see into the future. It’s a pity that in a show with that as its starting point that logic is sacrificed for the sake of entertainment. Sadly what’s left over is messier than an oil spill. Most characters get such little screen time you couldn’t care less what happened to them. There’s some exciting set pieces but often are more about style over substance. If I had a dollar for every time I said the phrase “But why didn’t they just [insert alternative here] instead” then I’d be doing quite well for myself. My assessment of Mirai Nikki may be harsh but the show puts itself into a corner quite quickly. It initially treats its premise seriously before topping it up with fanservice and changes in tone that were completely uncalled for.\
I’ll start things off with our main character Yukiteru Amano who might be one of the most difficult to understand characters put to screen. Harsh? Judge for yourself. Yuki has this incredible potential to pull courage out of his backside before it melts away in front of his eyes. One minute he’s running the show and the next minute he is a whiny shrimp. His writing is incredibly incoherent. I’m also given little reason to get behind him and cheer him on to victory. The decisions he makes are laughable. In a death game he seems more focused on maintaining friendship and escaping loneliness as opposed to actually winning. “I don’t mind getting killed as long as I can be socially accepted!” What a load of tripe. His social ineptitude feels like something as a means to instigate his story, but not something for him to overcome. His problems aren’t deep or interesting and they have little of a role to play once the game gets underway. Granted it’s a death game and you’re not really in it to overcome your personal problems, but honestly it’s the anime’s fault for pushing this agenda from early on.\
I have no idea what to make of Gasai Yuno, the pink haired yandere. I guess her unpredictability is most of her appeal, plus at least she has a concrete reason to fight, that being Yuki (Drinking game: Take a shot every time she says his name). Most of the interest I had in Mirai Nikki was “Oh I wonder what Yuno’s going to do now?” every time an event took place. She reacts with a purpose and doesn’t flinch in doing so, always lining up well with her deluded character. Because Yuki is such a bland individual I spent most of the show hoping Yuno would just mince everyone. However, Yuno isn’t a remarkable character, just one made to look better being surrounded by a bunch of forgettable individuals. Because her brainwaves basically shout “Yuki, Yuki, Yuki” her actions are pretty easy to read. With Yuno you’re really just in it to see how far down she can dig the hole.\
Hardly any other contestant is worth mentioning. They’re a forgettable group which all come with their predictable ‘tragic’ backstories. Everyone is too cheesy and villainous to command your appreciation. In a battle royale setup, giving all the characters meaningful motivation is important. Losing a contestant should make me feel sorry for them, not make me shrug my shoulders and count another step backwards from twelve. Remind me again why Deus would make any of these twelve wackos his successor? Does he even value the universe he protected? I should also mention that some character designs are hilarious and again go a long way to making me take the show even less seriously than I already was. Check out this little kid who has somehow developed the tendencies of a serial killer or a matron whose head has swollen to the size of a medicine ball! The difference in the capabilities of each diary is also amusing. Some of them never stood a chance from the very moment the game started while the power of another contestant makes me wonder how they didn’t win within 24 hours at most. There’s a ‘comedy’ tag missing under the genres section.\
This show shifts its tone more inappropriately than me after too many drinks at karaoke. When a serious mood is being built up, on too many occasions it was brought down instantly by some horrendous piece of comedy, usually with a jovial soundtrack to match. This wouldn’t be so bad if the show wasn’t on other occasions trying to treat its premise seriously and with a vain attempt at being mature. One minute we’re talking about the importance of free will and the next minute we’re talking about breast size with lesbian undertones... Because we just can. Nothing serious that Mirai Nikki has to say ever sticks with you because the cheap stuff that’s there to sell the show to the lowest common denominator taints it. It is never tense. It is never scary. It is childish and painful.\
It’s not just the see-sawing in the mood that took me out of the experience but also the shocking way the show wastes its story potential, mostly in the way the characters interact. I wanted to get invested into the story, I really did. It’s such an interesting premise. The idea of people fighting to change their destinies when they can see into the future sounds great.  But around half of the dozen contestants are absolutely pointless in the grand scheme of things. The writing of Mirai Nikki could have been a lot more focused if it cut down on the number of participants in the death game. Then we might have been able to see some meaningful interaction between the different parties. Heaven forbid, we might have actually seen the plans of many characters come into conflict! In a death game, where outwitting multiple people at once is essential, I’d expect this as a minimum. You won’t get that here.\
Mirai Nikki is content to make it Yuki and Yuno vs. everyone else, and that is disrespecting the aforementioned potential. Introducing all their opponents earlier and seeing more of the contestants outside of our lead duo fighting against each other would have kicked this show out of second gear. It bamboozles me that everyone throws themselves at Yuki and Yuno at separate occasions, and confuses me even further that they don’t go after each other more often. What on earth makes the ‘first’ and ‘second’ so darn important that they’re there centre of everyone’s attention? Don’t approach this show expecting someone’s plan to interfere with everyone else’s, like it should if it treated its premise with decency. The game rarely feels intense because of this.\
If I took a shot every time that a character had a clear cut opportunity to kill someone but didn’t do so then I probably wouldn’t be here to type up this review. I can’t stand it when a show doesn’t follow through with a logical progression in its plot just to stretch it out further for, say, entertainment value or to push some sappy theme. “I could kill you right now but before I do so you must prove to me you have learned [insert theme here]“. Come on. Really? Alliances in Mirai Nikki are also laughable. Very, very rarely do they actually make someone better off as opposed to just killing the other members. Yuki and Yuno find themselves often working through the game with the assistance of other contestants when it really wasn’t necessary.\
The strange clusterfuck of an ending to Mirai Nikki actually salvaged it somewhat in my book. While I think it comes out left field it was somewhat foreshadowed, so it’s not cheap. It was the high point for entertainment value in the show by a long shot. I wanted to see how the new situation dealt to the remaining characters would be overcome, because the setting actually felt suffocating for once. I was left satisfied by the conclusion but the journey there, well, I can’t say the same for it.\
If you want a thriller that’s easy to digest, one that can also throw an interesting surprise in your face, then give it a shot. If you’re able to look past the cast and give most of your attention to some of the action and set pieces then there’s fun to be had. Being more of a story and character-driven viewer it wasn’t my cup of tea, so I don’t think it’s my place to pick up the megaphone and shout into your ear that Mirai Nikki has zero value. Judge for yourself. It’s almost worth it for what waits at the end. Almost.\

    What would you do if someone would drop a \"bomb\" on you saying you can become god. It sounds fun huh? it is... until the same person says you have to kill other people involved in the same game. Mirai Nikki... Future Diary. The game spins around these devices that lead participants close to their objective.\
I found it frustrating, in a good way, that when an episode ended it made me want to watch more.. so I couldn't take a break.So I continued watching being constantly impressed by the things people can do when their lives are at stake or when they want to become\
          \
        god(for more ambitious ones). It was really tiresome to see Yukiteru being \"stabbed in the back\" over and over again only to find him always alone. Still this points out a horrible truth about this world, the fact that you can't see someone for who he really is.\
Also, the series is full of interesting motives and philosophical concepts that makes it worthwhile watching.\
Artwork consists of a perfect balance since its not too flashy and characters as well as background are designed well, making it ideal for those who want to follow the story as me.",

    1. Introduction/Synopsis: \
Suppose you are an everyday, normal high school student with no outstanding attributes or friends. You're not particularly good at sports or at academics, though you are pretty good at throwing darts. You spend most of your time keeping a diary of random things that happen around you and talking with an imaginary friend you invented called \"Deus Ex Machina\", the God of Space and time and his adorable little side-kick \"Murmur\". \
Then suddenly, one day out of nowhere, Deus gives you a diary and mentions something about a game. Entries pop up in your diary you haven't written yourself and it foretells\
          \
        future events spanning the next 90 days. All of it comes true. \
Your whole world turns upside down as you find out that your life is in danger and you have been placed in a game where there are 11 others like you with a diary that can be used to predict and even rewrite the future. You are forced to kill or die in an elimination battle to determine who will next ascend the Throne to Godhood after Deus. In the process, you gain an unnerving, relentless stalker girl who at first seems cute, but is completely insane. \
You are thrown into battles with opponents several levels out of your league from child prodigy to cult leader, with no one to protect you except the stalker. And more and more is revealed along the way to unnerve you as plot thickens and conspiracies unfold to make you shake in both fear and excitement. \
Congratulations, you now know what it's like to be Yukiteru \"Yuki\" Amano, the main character of Mirai Nikki. \
1. Story: 9/10\
Two things stand out most when watching Mirai Nikki - its thrilling plot and its vast array of characters with their own unique back-stories and layers of depth. What makes the plot amazing is the characters, and what makes the characters amazing is the plot. \
The story itself employs the \"layer\" method, which peels away depths of the story and the background of the two main characters - Yuki and his stalker girlfriend Yuno as we progress through battles with each and every other unique diary user. And this method is extremely effective as we switch between finding out more about the two main characters Yuki and Yuno, battles and back-stories with the other ten diary users, Deus and Murmur, and even non-diary users that become relevant to the central story. \
The mood of the story is very, very dark - it is both psychological thriller and partly horror. Not supernatural horror like ghosts and zombies, but the horror comes in the form of Gasai Yuno. And the best part about the story is ---spoiler--- that you cannot bring back those you have killed using either cheap plot devices or Deus Ex Machina (which is ironic, because that's the name of the God of Space and time). That in itself gets a lot of points. \
With the dark mood and the layer method that slowly peels away at dark secrets and locked away pasts that we are scared, but excited to see, the story becomes very captivating and really draws you in. To be frank, I was pretty much addicted to the show throughout. \
And the ending, My GOD the ending. If there is anything so perfect and amazing to the plot is how the series ends, when the final layer is peeled and we find out terrible things about Gasai Yuno, who is not whom she seems to be. I won't go beyond that so that I won't spoil anything, but trust me when I say you will want to watch it to the end to find out the unravel entire back-story of hers. \
If I do have one gripe about the story, it's that it seems the original creator wanted Yuki and Yuno to touch base and have a standoff with every single character. That is not realistic, in my opinion, and I feel it would have been better done and more realistic if more of the other diary users could fight with each other rather than have them all face the two main characters. \
It is a survival battle, after all and in reality, other characters will try to face other characters in the meantime. \
2. Art 9/10: \
The style of art is quite well done. I really enjoyed the dark style that comes with the setting and horror element complimented with some light-hearted, humorous events that span the series from school life to Gasai Yuno's awkwardness and hilarious stalker things she does. \
And the best part was the style in the opening theme with the use of darkness and light. And Gasai Yuno's insanity was portrayed really, really well. \
Excellently done. I am not a big fan of horror itself, so I couldn't find it in me to give the style of art a full score. If I particularly enjoyed horror, I would have given it a perfect 10/10! \
3. Sound 8/10: \
Music - the music was wonderfully done, complimenting the horror and the action scenes very well. The opening theme and the ending theme was superb in my opinion and I would personally love to hear more by people who created the music!\
Voice Acting - Ugh... while I do enjoy some, if not most of the voice actors (especially Gasai Yuno, whoever voiced her is a genius), I could not quite find it in myself to give the voice a full score because of Yukiteru Yuki and his constant whining. He's not the character with the strongest of heart and he isn't the most annoying character in the history of anime, but that still does not mean I don't want to tear my hair out if I have to hear him whine one more time. Anyway, my rant on Yukiteru will continue in the Character section. \
Sound effects - very well done, especially the gun shots, the explosions, and the clash of sword on sword. \
Overall, aside from a few minor complaints on voice acting, I rather enjoyed the sounds! \
4. Characters 10/10: \
We're going to break this down into 4 major categories: Yuno and Yuki, Deus and Murmur, the other diary users, and the non-diary users. Warning - there WILL be LIGHT SPOILERS ahead. I will always try to keep it to a minimum, but with Mirai Nikki, it is almost unavoidable. \
(1.a) Yukiteru \"Amano\" Yuki 6/10 - Starting out, he showed promise. He was a normal high school student, perhaps slightly selfish and a loner, but he seemed like the kind of guy who had potential to make exciting things happen. And then, he... doesn't follow through. \
Now, I don't mind that he is a weak character. I don't need a character to be strong in order to like him or her. Gasai Yuno more than makes up for him (see 1.b Gasai Yuno). What I cannot stand is an overly idealistic character that whines all the time and tries to save everyone even though he neither possesses the skill nor strength to do so. He cannot accept reality and is extremely emotionally weak. To me, he is the true damsel in distress in the series who is constantly whining with Gasai Yuno being the knight in shining armor turned monster. If I have to hear him whine and say \"I want to save everybody\" one more time, I will either tear my hair out or the person's next to me. \
But towards the end, he does turn out quite interesting in his own way, especially when he is later corrupted by Gasai Yuno and he does things that cannot be taken back, breaking gears just to find out that he cannot reverse it. And that's why I did not give him a failing score. We're going into heavy spoiler zone here, so I'll just leave it at that.\
So to those who want to drop the series just because of this guy, I say - grind on. There is hope for him in the end, yet! :D\
(1.b) Gasai Yuno 12/10. Yes. 12. Not 10 out of 10. 12 out of 10. That's how amazing of a character she is. I rarely grade a character above a full score, but for her, I had to make an exception.\
She is Yuki's psychopathic Knight in shining armor turned Monster. She is the epitome of Yandere and characters. She did so many unspeakable things and hides them so well that it took Yuki and even Akise (the genius detective and the strongest non-diary user) a long time to find out. She stalks Yuki and tricks him so many times into loving her, then betraying his trust, but in the end, he still falls for her. Plus I love girls going after guys :D. \
She also gets bonus points for being a strong female character, as I am quite fond of anime who have males and females balanced with equal status. I am a strong advocate of equal rights and opportunity after all. She takes out some of the strongest diary users like they are nothing as if she were rigged (and towards the end, you find out it makes perfect sense). She has one of the most horrible and darkest secrets that you WANT to find out about as well as a past that explains it all. She is mentally unbalanced and completely insane. And she seems to be in conspiracy with either Murmur or Deus. \
She drives the plot forward towards the future and even back into the past with the backstories. Every time something is revealed about her or she does something unspeakable, you never fail to cover your mouth and gasp. She is full of surprises and never ceases to amaze you. \
If there is any reason to watch Mirai Nikki, it is her. Trust me, just like you want to watch Great Teacher Onizuka just for Eichiro Onizuka, you will want to watch Mirai Nikki just for this girl. \
Again 12/10. Masterpiece. \
(2) Other diary users 10/10 - There are 12 in total, so excluding Yuki and Yuno, there are still 10 others. I enjoyed every single last one of them from child prodigy to cult leaders. I'm not going to go into depth on all of them as my review is already longer than I had anticipated. So I'm going to talk about the few that I particularly enjoyed. \
Namely - Uryuu Minene XD! *Goes into fanboy mode* She hands down my 2nd favorite character next to Gasai Yuno. She is unpredictable as she is an international terrorist (yes, terrorist, and no I don't think she's part of the Al-Qaeda) and she uses BOMBS, takes HOSTAGES, and is not afraid to use any method no matter how unorthodox it is to survive. Plus she loses an eye early on and has to wear an eyepatch. I wanted to date at least one girl who wears an eyepatch after that XD. \
After her would be Reisuke Houjou, the 4 year old child prodigy who has the knowledge of an elite university student and he is so cute that you cannot help but neglect thinking of him as someone dangerous. And then wake up and find yourself in a setting similar to the games that John Kramer from \"Saw\" has planned. The child sets you to be trapped in a twisted \"game\" where he makes the rules and you have to play by those rules. He has fun along the way, not killing you immediately but instead toying with you along the way to get maximum enjoyment to the point where even the invincible Gasai Yuno is almost killed by him. This is the first time we meet a character who is as twisted and insane as Yuno herself. \
And the other 8 are nearly just as good! They each have their own backstory from twisted to tragic. Each of them are geniuses in their own rights and have their own unique ways of fighting from commanding humans/beasts to setting traps and even dueling you in straightforward combat. \
Not all of the diary-users and their back-stories are strong, but they are strong enough overall to make me give them an overall 10/10. They are a wonderful cast and very few of them will leave you bored (*cough* though I can't stand that masked superhero*cough* He annoys me almost as much as Yuki).\
(3). Deus and Murmur 9/10 - I can't say much without spoiling much, but let's just say they make quite an interesting pair. they are exactly the polar opposites of each other. He is huge, she is tiny. He is cold and calculated, she is cute and bubbly. He is sane and thinks with reason, she... doesn't. XD\
And they play each other for fools, as they each have their own way of trying to figure out the intentions of the other. \
(4) Non-diary users 8/10 - Most of them are a bit meh for me. Nishijima (a police officer who is in love with Uryuu Minene) and Kosaka (who used to bully Yuki and then turned his friend) are slightly enjoyable in their own way, but also very annoying. So is the girl Hinata Hino who ---spoiler--- commands the army of hounds for her grandfather who turns out to be the true diary user. \
So why give it such a high 8 out of 10? One word - ARU AKISE XD! *Goes into fanboy mode*\
He is my 3rd favorite character and hands down my favorite male character in the series. First, he is a genius detective and is extremely hilarious. ---spoiler---He fools you into thinking he is a diary user and even I suspected and groaned when I thought he was, but was shocked to find that he is not. ---spoiler--- He merely has genius deductive skills to the point that you think he could predict the future. \
He is amongst the first to figure out the truth behind Yuno and Murmur (no, I won't tell you what it is in the review, so either you watch it for yourself or google it, though I highly recommend you watch it for yourself). He is the strongest of the non-diary user with both wits and brawn and nearly matches Yuno in hand-to-hand combat. If Yuno is the most unpredictable character, then Akise is the best character at deduction and prediction. \
PLUS ---SPOILER--- He shares a kiss scene with Yuki at some point, which will probably appease all the Yaoi fans out there. \
Again, the characters make the plot work, and trust me when I say you do want to watch the series for the character, which I feel is the one element Mirai Nikki did best. \
5. Enjoyment 10/10\
Finally, enjoyment? It sends me on an emotional coaster and a huge mindfuck through the entire series. It is one of the pinnacles of psychological thrillers alongside the big names of Death Note, Code Geass, and Monster, etc.\
Is never failed to keep me captivated, even if I felt it started slow at first. It escalated really fast and ALL the characters get their own time and backstories. \
Overall Conclusion\
This is one of my all-time favorite series. It is one of the reasons I am glad to have joined MAL, with special thanks to AviJii who introduced this to me in the first place. :D\
It made me laugh, it made me gasp, it made me cry, it kept me captivated through. This is one of those series that I highly recommend to anyone who wants to watch an anime that will blown your mind away. \
Highly recommended to anyone who wants a good story with SOLID characters, including an insane stalker with an unstable mind XD. \
9/10 Excellent\
\
Remember, this review is personal and based on my personal experience of it, and it will be unfair to expect everyone to agree. \
So I ask you, the readers of my review: What about you? What did you think? Feel free to agree or disagree and point out what you thought you liked or disliked about Mirai Nikki! :D\

    Sakae Esuno’s Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) is a fine combination of suspense, blood, and violent action. It is a psychological thriller that revolves around two middle schoolers, Yuki (the male protagonist) and Yuno (the female protagonist), participating in a deadly battle royale with 10 strangers. It’s personally one of my favorite gory anime, but it lacks the opportunity to become a more frightening series. Mirai Nikki’s reputation as a gruesome anime is mostly thanks to the memorable Yandere character, Gasai Yuno. Commonly known as Yuki's psychotic stalker in the series, Yuno describes herself as “a half moon” that has “a bright half and a dark\
          \
        half.” The anime involves reverse gender roles with the girl protecting the guy under any circumstances, delivering bloody violence at every corner. However, the few downsides of the anime, including plot twists and some wacky characters, can cause one to produce mixed feelings about this anime.\
Story (7)\
The rules of the game are pretty straightforward: kill everyone until you’re the last one standing. Thankfully, there are no sudden changes in the rules or mercy shown between characters to interrupt the flow. The participants’ sudden actions constantly changes the future of other participants, creating new objectives between characters. However, it causes a slight downfall when Yuki is immediately made the center of attention among the other 11 diary holders, when Deus Ex Machina declares Yuki as his favorite to win the game. Despite the shocking events that leads to the conclusion of the game, that particular part of the story already makes the story seem clichéd. The reward for the winner is becoming Dues Ex Machina’s successor as the next God of Time and Space. It sounds boring, but it is understandable considering the powers that come with being a god. Characters have either good (reviving a lost friend or family member) or evil (time traveling to cause destruction to an individual’s life) intentions. The characters’ motives bring some excitement to the story, but it could’ve been a more captivating story.\
The plot is not original as it is another battle royale anime, but there are some unique aspects to the story. One is the different forms of their diaries. Although the majority of the diaries are cell phones, other diaries are suitable for certain characters’ situations. Each diary also has special features specifically for that particular diary holder, giving that person an advantage over other diary holders. The show provides backgrounds on each participant of the game, instead of only focusing on the two main leads, to help the viewer determine whether or not certain characters are likeable.\
There is some light humor within the series, particularly with the quotes. E.g. Yuki yells “Crazy stalker alert!” or similar quotes in his head in reference to Yuno in an episode or two. Additionally, the characters' actions may seem illogical (e.g. a diary holder mysteriously hopping on a motorcycle to escape from death), but it’s important to be mindful that the anime is meant to be supernatural. The winner becomes the God of Time and Space after all.\
The story is fast-paced and doesn’t beat around the bush with fillers. The violence in the anime goes from light-heavy-light (introduction of the game to its conclusion). Deaths are not sudden, allowing the viewer to understand the characters’ motives by providing backstories. Romance is one-sided in the beginning as a cowardly Yuki only teams up with the tough Yuno to protect himself. However, love slowly becomes mutual as they survive several obstacles together. \
Multiple plot twists and plot holes cause questions like “Wait. What just happened?” There are tons of them present within the series. It requires patience as some parts are not fully explained until the last few episodes. The ending throws in a major plot twist by taking the viewer through parallel universes, so it could appear confusing. It ends with a cliffhanger, but its 30-minute sequel Mirai Nikki Redial completes the story.\
Characters (7)\
There are both notable and forgettable characters in Mirai Nikki, and the characters’ personalities range from wacky to badass. Character development is excellent, even though it takes a while to become present in some characters. Within the 12 diary owners, you have a terrorist, a 4-year-old mastermind, and a fatal married couple. Although there are a few unattractive villains, the majority of them are unforgettable and capable of becoming one’s favorite character from the show or anime in general. Uniquely, all 12 diary holders, including Yuki and Yuno, are named after Roman gods and goddesses. Yuki is named after Jupiter, the god of the sky, weather, and lightning. \
Yuki appears in the show as a whiny and gullible male lead, who doesn’t seem to understand or accept the dangers of the game. His character develops into someone more self-confident and manly as one tragic event leads to another, contributing to the show’s terror. Yuno is the Yandere female lead of the show who truly highlights the gore and violence that makes Mirai Nikki an excellent psychological thriller. Although she is shown as strictly a creepy obsessive stalker in the beginning, her character becomes more reasonable near the end as her past is completely exposed.\
Art (7)\
Animation was mostly good and fit the horrific and bloody atmosphere, especially Yuno’s killing sprees. Character designs are both good and bad. All characters are distinguishable, even though some designs are non-menacing. Some of the villains had ridiculous designs that would probably scare the crap out of you if he/she stands at your bedside, but it may appear more comical through the screen, unless you’re watching it in 3D. E.g. The Twelfth diary holder wears a large, round one-eyed mask, while acting like a Marvel superhero. Also, Deus Ex Machina and Murmur looks more like child-friendly mythical creatures instead of horrifying. Although there are bloody and disturbing scenes that are intended to make Mirai Nikki horrifying, the character designs take away a portion of the horror.\
Characters’ emotions and personalities were detailed, giving off the fearful atmosphere. E.g. Yuno’s appearance was timely with immediate switches from her innocence to psychotic features. Yuki’s eyes displaced fear within the series to fulfill his earliest role as a major coward. \
Sound (10)\
The Japanese voices expresses the anime’s terrifying atmosphere more so than the English voices. Japanese VA Tomosa Murata has the perfect voice to bring out Yuno’s psychological features. She gives Yuno an innocent voice to embrace her split personality. In contrast, English VA Brina Palencia makes Yuno sound like a tomboy, and there's no innocence in her voice. Yuki’s character is voiced by a female seiyuu named Misuzu Togashi. A female voice is more reasonable considering his pathetic and cowardly attitude within the series. The OP, ED, and background music suit Mirai Nikki’s creepy theme, making it one of the anime’s strongest points.\
Enjoyment (8)\
I’m a sucker for anime listed under the horror and psychological thriller genre, and Mirai Nikki is quite a thrill. The action and murders are entertaining, but I wished for the story to be more menacing that it already was. The character development enabled me to tolerate certain characters after a while and find some of them likeably remarkable. I grew confused with the plot twists, but the story began to unravel near the end. This is one anime I wouldn’t mind re-watching multiple times.\
Overall (7)\
Mirai Nikki has an interesting story full of gore and violence that overcomes the plot twists. The viewer is introduced to a vast amount of potential likeable characters. A small number of characters may look and act too comical, making the anime seem less serious. On the bright side, the combination of the suspense, character development, and sound contribute to Mirai Nikki’s psychological theme. If you're a fan of gore and survival anime, I recommend giving Mirai Nikki a try.\

    This anime series left me speechless... and I don't necessarily mean that in a good way.\
The story was engaging from the beginning.  Don't get me wrong. It was just that the premise was completely and utterly arbitrary. For the most part, especially throughout the first two thirds of the series, you can forgive it as the story keeps hinting that there is a meaning behind it all.  It tries to make out that the premise isn't arbitrary, that its a deep story line which will have an ending that will blow you away.  Well... the ending does blow you away, with a\
          \
        sawed off double barrel shotgun.  So yes... it does do that at least. Essentially its a narrative about people who can read the future all trying to kill each other.\
And then there is Gasai Yuno.  WHAT THE...?!!\
Possibly one of the most bizarre, interesting and (dare I say it) entertaining characters I've seen.  She's what makes you keep watching, to try and find out what the hell is really going on.  I won't say more.\
However, apart from this one character, the plot holes are too deep, too wide and too glaring.  I suppose I can forgive one lapse in logic.  Two begins to bug me.  But in Mirai Nikki the annoying plot holes keep adding up.  \
The term \"plot holes\" doesn't really do justice to what is happening.  They are not so much \"holes\" as they are rice paper sheets plastered over windows in order to keep the sun of reality from shining through.  It does an admirable job, and you admire it for trying its darned best...  but when the dawn comes, there ain't nothin' those thin sheets are going to do when the rays hit.\
I'll be watching and then a sudden red flag pops up in my mind warning me that what I am watching is illogical.  I'll push it to the back of my mind. But that annoying feeling just keeps itching away, until you are finally forced to vocalise your annoying niggling feeling either aloud to yourself or to your just as bemused friend sitting next to you... before they voice it first.\
Okay, I'm exaggerating here.\
Mirai Nikki is entertaining.  The fight scenes and some of the scenarios of the participants of the \"survival game\" are quite entertaining.  You'll have to suspend your disbelief for quite a while in order to enjoy this anime.  It is most certainly possible given the music, the action sequences and the animation are all really well done, slick and sharp.  There will be moments when you'll be wanting to question \"why?\" or \"what?\" or \"when?\"...  Just ignore those irritating questions, sit back and enjoy the Gasai Yuno show...\
sorry?  I mean Mirai Nikki... Did I say the Gasai Yuno show?\

    It's been quite a while since I've seen a series as laughably bad as Future Diary. Focused on a survival game with our weak-willed male lead Yukiteru and a yandere gal named Yuno obsessively in love with him, this series is a huge mess with plot and character developments, proper logic, mood consistency and relishing in its graphic and depraved content way too much.\
The biggest issue that stems with Future Diary is that it seems to get too fixated in advancing its plot head-on without any regard for proper depth, buildup and consistency. There are a number of unexplored elements to the series like how\
          \
        Yukiteru became acquainted with Deus and why many of the folks Deus chose for the survival game are a bunch of psychopaths, criminals and loons. Logic is tossed out the window with how certain plot setups occur and characters making decisions that don't make much sense like one character able to rig a ridiculous number of bombs throughout a school without anyone even noticing and Yukiteru continuing to trust Yuno despite knowing full well how much of a nutcase she is. A number of the players in the survival game don't get much depth beyond being crazed loons and criminals, and those who do get some sort of depth only get them in a scope of a couple episodes where their mentality for the violent and depraved acts they commit don't make any sense and seemed sloppily pasted together. The series lacks a consistent mood as it tries mixing around deadly serious storytelling and comedy at a number of points with the interactions between Yuno and Yukiteru, which felt awkward and ill-timed in execution. The final episodes of the series seemed sloppy in their execution with convenient developments and plot twists that either get convoluted or are poorly explored. And lastly, it tends to relish too greatly at many points in its graphic and depraved content with a good number of violent and gory scenes, a good amount of nudity and sexual content, torture, rape, child abuse, terrorism and a diverse number of ways to murder folks. It's like whoever made this series wanted to make it a seinen title, yet winded up with the immaturity and cheesiness you would find with a cookie-cutter shounen title in the way it is set up and structured.\
The visuals to Future Diary are on the plain side with character designs sporting the typical mainstream look and scenery shots being decent with what they deliver. The CG animation for this (used mostly with vehicles or rendering the world of Deus ex Machina) is a bit sloppy as it looks awkwardly rendered and clearly sticks out from the typical animation of the series. The animation is nothing to write home about either with flat choreography during fight scenes and a decent number of animation shortcuts used throughout the title's run.\
Overall, Future Diary is one of the biggest messes in quality that I've seen in a while from a title getting plenty of hype from anime fans. With no regard for proper depth, consistency and buildup in the treatment of its plot and characters, as well as relishing in its objectionable content and themes, Future Diary is a lovely train wreck of a title that may get either disgust or unintentional laughs from fans with its content and sloppy execution. \

    Mirai Nikki is about Yuno. Regardless of any other plotlines that seem to be in the forefront, it is her circumstances that are in the center of what the series is about. The show focuses on the desperation that led to her destructive need for someone else to satisfy her desire for security, the mindless willingness to kill that resulted from the collapse of her mental stability, and the fragments of sanity that return to her periodically and at the last with the possibility of what she could have been, had she held on to her reason for just a bit longer.\
While Yuno’s condition leads\
          \
        to some nerve-wracking and amusing scenarios that are just fun to watch, her feelings, though extreme and fueled by madness, are not unnatural at all. Afraid of being alone and rejected because of her past, she latches onto someone who, in her mind, provides protection from emotional distress, and does all in her power to keep him by her side.\
Yuki doesn’t have one steady “character arc” throughout the series, and this is not necessarily a bad thing. He starts out weak and wimpy and he is aware of it, and his terror especially makes sense when he is suddenly faced with life and death situations. By the end of the series, he has not become a strong, confident person because of the extraordinary challenges. Throughout the series, there are moments when he finds his strength, but he doesn’t make a radical 180. He still makes foolish decisions like the young, spineless person he was from the start. He wavers between exploiting Yuno’s willingness to protect him, growing to love her for who she is in her moments of sanity, and finding the courage to be strong for her sake. Although he is never a completely independent person, which would be unlikely considering his disposition, his unhealthy dependence on Yuno becomes a more loving, natural one.\
As Mirai Nikki is almost wholly concerned with Yuno’s story, almost every development hinges on what she will do next, and the moments with the greatest amount of buildup and emotional investment are those in which she is the focus. The amount of time and effort they spend developing her character is an asset to the show, but the plot of the series gets neglected as a result and sometimes seems like nothing more than a wobbly framework for her story. The encounters with each contestant of the survival game struggle to carry any weight, as they are usually little more than a confrontation with a person who is crazy or evil just for the sake or it, or else has a melodramatic backstory and flimsy motivations. The course of the encounters sometimes provide circumstances to demonstrate some characteristic of Yuno or progress in her relationship with Yuki in some fashion, but more often than not they fail even to accomplish this and it just seems like poorly executed filler.\
The show feels rather like a thriller with so many close brushes with death, often at the hands of the cloying Yuno, and a halfhearted attempt at a horror series with some graphic, nauseating violence. The former works fairly well when Yuno is involved as her sweet, oblivious creepiness is as well-executed as every other aspect of her character, while the use of gore produces a reckless overindulgence in the barbaric that is more fun than disturbing.\
But for Yuno’s steady underlying plotline, the whole series is out of control for the most part, taking sudden, crazy twists and turns often due to the foolish decisions of the cast. Yuno’s abilities, too, though fueled by rushes of mad adrenaline and probably some prior experience, are mostly absurd. Depending on the mood of the viewer, these elements could seem either fun or messy, and the series does itself something of a disservice in taking itself a little too seriously throughout all these developments. Even so, the lack of moderation feels a bit liberating amidst the measured, aspiring realism in many anime.\
The opening and closing songs are not catchy or easy to listen to. They always feel on edge with way too many words and phrases struggling to find room for themselves, especially in the second OP, which is mostly Engrish with little meaning. This OP as a whole is an aimless mess and a stranger to timing. However, this is in contrast to the first OP’s perfectly synced, evocative imagery, and the second ED’s insightful focus on Yuno’s sorrowful mental state.\
Mirai Nikki’s soundtrack itself often creates a cool, devilish atmosphere with energetic synthesizers. But during many episodes some gorgeous instrumental piece will break through to indicate that amidst Mirai Nikki’s crazy, edgy exterior lurks a more sentimental story that gradually finds its way into the spotlight as the series progresses.\
Mirai Nikki’s graphics are crystal clear, with bold black outlines and solid, bright colors that prevent the kind of fluffy sheen that usually accompanies modern anime. The series retains an odd sort of artistic consistency with its regular use of overly loud colors, even if they do not blend particularly well with each other. Where the animation mostly struggles is in maintaining proportions as the characters change positions. Sometimes their legs look too small as they sit down or their heads look too big from certain perspectives. However, this awkwardness is rare and usually short-lived.\
The series’ facial designs are more proportionate than those of most anime. Although the eyes are still abnormally large, the characters’ faces are longer with larger, bolder noses and mouths to compensate. This makes them slightly less appealing in the customary anime sense and eliminates almost any traces of moe, giving the anime an impression of age it does not have. Yuki’s small, short facial design is the one that comes closest to disrupting this impression, singling him out from the others with the more childlike appearance befitting his vulnerability.\
Overall, Mirai Nikki is a rather messy series but that is part of what makes it so much fun, and amidst all the craziness is a somewhat bittersweet story of an unstable pair who slowly grow to love each other in truth despite their unhealthy mindsets.\

    Mirai Nikki or Future Diary is perhaps one of the best shows I have seen of the year of it's release. I personally think the show is a must see and would highly recommend it to those searching for a really good and exciting psychological thriller. While I do believe the show is great, it does however suffers terribly from a bad bandwagon effect so don't let negative opinions or reviews affect your time watching. \
That aside, I'm going to start with the characters. On my list of things I liked about the show, characters or characterization is number one. I really enjoy watching shows\
          \
        were the characters have bad or traumatizing backgrounds stories because I feel like that really makes most characters grow emotionally and develop. I personally didn't care for the main character Yukiteru Amano because I dislike seeing the common archetype of mentally and psychically weak characters however, boy oh boy did that change. Of course thanks actions and behavior from the unforgettable and lovable character Yuno Gasai are annoying, weak main character was able to develop and grow (just a little) however sufficient enough to make him somewhat likable. In the characters department Future diary has so much going on for it.\
The story, is perhaps one of the best for Psychological mystery, horror. Your ideal psychological and mystery horror genre is something that should \"A.G.E.G.  \"Always keep Em guessing\" and that is one thing I really enjoyed about future diary. There are lots of shows that try to keep the audience guessing, however most are either really predictable or obvious when it comes to solving mysteries. The Future diary however takes a totally different, and unexpected approach with this. The story really revolves around character growth and will. Mostly the will to get stronger... and well \"Survive.\"\
Another thing I liked about the story was the action, of course surviving the game meant killing other players and  I found there were lots of fighting scenes and moments (Especially towards the end)  during the show where I was completely engaged and moved. Lastly, romance. One thing I'll give extra credit to the future diary is for the romance. In spite of all the craziness that is going on, the bonds between most of characters are so strong. I loved seeing the bond between Yuki and Yuno grow during the show.\
Soundtrack was amazing, I don't believe that there is a single anime fans music player that doesn't have at least one song from Mirai Nikki downloaded to it. It really ties in well with the story especially, and most noticeably the tender moments, such as love, or something sad. The music was so beautifully well composed, and it is just bliss to hear.\
The artwork pretty good, standard 2010's art style, with great use of CGI during most scenes and used on certain characters. There is of course nudity in the show however nothing really stands out too much. Character designs were nicely done, a pretty decent transition from the manga adaptation. \
Overall I found Mirai Nikki to be a well written (though cliche at times)  and unique story. I would recommend it to those viewers and anime fans who want to see a great murder mystery with a game type theme/setting. Final review edit and score  9/10 for epic story and finish.\

    NO SPOILERS. I promise! :)\
Mirai Nikki, for most people, will be a hit or miss. It tries to combine a HELL of a lot of genres into one small package's worth of 26 episodes. There's probably a misconception that Mirai Nikki can be classified a \"psychological thriller\" the same way Death Note or Steins;Gate is commonly labeled, however, Mirai Nikki takes on a slightly different tone. At its core, Mirai Nikki was a romance.\
\
Story - 8\
It's difficult to judge Mirai Nikki's story. While it's concept is incredibly unique, it's hard to say that the presentation of it is done well. The plot twists are unexpected\
          \
        and wild, especially as the story reaches its climax, but gaping plot holes tarnish the experience a bit. You will NOT enjoy Mirai Nikki's story if you are expecting a bulletproof mystery story.\
The first few episodes were extremely interesting for me. As the story progresses, however, it becomes apparent that many questions are left unanswered, and the show starts to become dull and dragged on. Mirai Nikki is another example of an anime that was too long for the story it had to tell. However, the show pulls itself together during the final episodes and picks up the pace in time to leave a mixed final impression. \
\
Art - 9\
The art is great, but not outstanding. It's evident that a lot of work was put into the action scenes to make it, well, action, and characters are drawn well. Overall, the art scheme is simply very fitting for what Mirai Nikki is. It's dark enough to be taken seriously as an action/psychological/thriller, but comedic and lighthearted as well for the aspects that need it. Mood changes within the anime are carried out pretty well.\
\
Sound - 9\
Great openings, endings, and BGM. Nothing too memorable, though.\
\
Character - 10\
Character is where Mirai Nikki becomes something to love or hate. For one thing, there are so many characters in this anime that it could not possibly hope to develop all of them or properly introduce them. The one thing it never falters from, however, is the focus on the two main characters, Yuki and Yuno. And this is where I believe Mirai Nikki truly shines.\
A note on the main protagonist: Yuki is the typical Shinji archetype. He's weak, pathetic, and socially screwed, and although he goes through some incredible character development, he never becomes strong. If you are looking for that kind of Shounen anime, you should turn away now, because this kind of main character gets annoying REALLY fast. \
There is no doubt in my heart, though, that Yuki becomes an entirely different person at the end of the show. He goes through a beautiful cycle of love, depression, misunderstanding and regret. Although Yuno's character development seems nonexistent at first, she is a truly unique character that is slowly unraveled and developed as well as the story reaches its climax.\
\
Enjoyment - 8\
Overall, I was pleased with the feeling that Mirai Nikki gave me. The only aspect of the show that brought it down to an 8 was that the story dragged on too long in the middle and my interest waned. I was pleasantly surprised, however, as the series finished. And although I usually come to dislike most endings, the ending to Mirai Nikki wasn't too bad.\
\
Overall - 9\
Watch it for a unique experience, but it may not be what you're looking for.",

    Mirai Nikki (or The Future Diary in English) was a mixed bag for me. While there are some very good moments, there are some that just make want to pull out my hair in frustration. But there is one thing I know for sure: I felt somewhat underwhelmed. It wasn't horrible; it just wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be.\
~~~~~~~\
Story: 7/10\
In the world of Mirai Nikki, the god of time and space, Deus Ex Machina, is coming to the end of his lifespan. In order to find out who will be his successor, he sends something called \"Future Diaries\" (ranging from\
          \
        cell phones to a coloring book) to twelve different people and places them a life-and-death game, similar to the ones in The Hunger Games and Battle Royale.\
For the most part, Mirai Nikki's story is quite decent. It shows how the actions of people can change the future, because as the saying goes: \"Actions speak louder than words.\" It also shows how events can cause an impact on their reasoning of becoming God (seeing as all the diary holders (or at least half of them) are emotionally broken in some way). However, one of the problems with the story is its inconsistency, plot holes, and predictability. While there were parts that kept me on the edge of my seat, there were also parts that just left me absolutely confused. This confusion was evident during the last few episodes, where I was like: \"What the hell is happening?\" The ending also left a somewhat sour taste in my mouth... (Yes, I DO know that there's the OVA, \"Mirai Nikki Redial\". I just haven't watched it at the time I'm writing this review)\
Overall, while the story did have some hiccups, and was predictable at times, it was still engaging enough to keep me watching.\
~~~~~~~\
Characters: 5/10:\
Mirai Nikki has almost the exact same problem that SAO had for me: its characters. While not as frustrating as the ones in SAO, it's still the weakest part of show for me.\
First, Yukiteru (or Yuki for short). His character is similar to that of Shinji Ikari from Neon Genesis Evangelion (and to an extent, Simon from Gurren Lagann), in which he's pretty much a wuss; but that's not my problem with him, because I would feel the exact same way if I were in his place. My problem with Yuki is his stupidity, as well as the inconsistency of his character. How the hell can he be still in love with Yuno after she locked him up, as well as preventing him from making any friends? I just find it mindboggling. I know he's the key to keeping her sane, but still! Another thing I don't like is how his personality does a complete 180 degree turn during somewhere within the final third of the show. I was like: \"What? This came out of nowhere! Please explain to me what just happened!\" \
Secondly, there's Yuno, who is pretty much the fan-favorite of the show, as well as being the poster-child of yanderes. I'll be honest: I'm not a fan of Yuno. Maybe it's me, but I'm not the biggest fan of yanderes, as well as very possessive girlfriends. Yes, she does have her moments of batshit crazy awesomeness, but whenever she goes \"Yuki!!!\" several times, I'm just thinking \"Shut up already!!\" I do understand she does get some complexity, but that only really happens throughout the final episodes. And before you Yuno fans scream at me, let me say this: While I don't like Yuno, I DO understand why she's so popular, and why people do like her. I'm just not one of those people.\
The supporting cast didn't fare much better. From Yuki's friends to the other diary-holders, none of them seemed memorable to me. They range from alright to just unbearably irritating. There are two exceptions to this, though. The only side characters (as well as only characters from the show in general) that I actually enjoyed were the Twelfth, Akise and Minene (9th). They were just really interesting to watch. I really wished Twelfth had more screen time, though.\
With the exceptions of who I stated above, the cast of Mirai Nikki didn't leave an impact on me.\
~~~~~~~\
Animation: 7/10\
While the animation of Mirai Nikki isn't anything spectacular, it was pretty decent. The action scenes probably best animated parts of the show, being fast-paced as well as being VERY entertaining, especially when Yuno is on one of her many killing sprees.\
While nothing special, the animation was good for what it was.\
~~~~~~~\
Music: 8/10\
The music, for me, is the highlight of the anime. While I can't find a song that stands out, the background music does a very good job fitting every scene in the show. Both of the openings are amazing. They have a good amount of energy and fit the tone of the show perfectly (The first opening has become one of my favorites), and while the endings didn't do that much for me, they were still interesting enough to listen to for a few episodes).\
All in all, the music is by far my favorite part of Mirai Nikki.\
~~~~~~~\
Enjoyment: 8/10\
Despite all of its flaws, Mirai Nikki was definitely entertaining to watch. While there were parts that left me with confusion and/or frustration, there were parts that just wanted me to click \"Next\" to watch the next episode.\
~~~~~~~\
Overall Score: 7.0 out of 10\
Mirai Nikki is an anime that I have a love-hate relationship with. While the show did have some \"bumps in the road\" character-wise, it did not deter me from finishing the anime. While I don't love the show as much as others do, it was definitely worth the watch. It was definitely entertaining, to say the least.\

    This is a great series\
Story 9: This is essentially a Battle Royale with a very unique romance story. \
Battle Royale angle: We’ve all seen versions of this before, where 8-12 people fight to the death to obtain a grand prize. The strength of Mirai Nikki’s plot is not about the originality of the premise but about the originality (and insanity) of the journey. There is an excellent mix of action, slashing, backstabbing, detective work, plot twists, and craziness. I was impressed by how clever this anime was which is a breath of fresh air. This isn’t a “horror” anime but there are a number of\
          \
        legitimately creepy moments. \
Romance angle: Woven into the storyline is an odd-yet-touching romance between the two main characters which revolves around Yuno’s “Yandere”-style pursuit of Yukki (btw this is NOTHING like School Days). I really liked their dynamic as it stayed away from many of the anime-relationship clichés: tsundere female slowly warming up to an endlessly patient male lead, the classic high school love triangle, or super shy male flirts with super shy female for 23/24 episodes before finally making a move. No, no, no…not with Yuno/Yukki. Without giving anything away (as this is apparent from episode one), the primary romantic dilemma is really best summed up by this quote: “do you really love me or are you just insane?” That's for you to decide and the series keeps the audience oscillating back and forth from “poor, sweet, vulnerable Yuno” to “Ok Yuno stop…you’re scaring the shit out of me.”\
When you put the whole story to together you get an exciting and captivating ride.\
Characters 9: Best part of the series by far. The romantic aspect of the relationship is hilarious because of how crazy Yuno can be. \
I went into Mirai Nikki with no warning or context. My first impression of Yuno when she met Yukii in the elevator was “oh sheesh, another one of these cute, cardboard harem girls who inexplicably falls in love with the outcast loner” i.e. Megan Fox in Transformers. Man was I wrong. Yuno is a DEEPLY flawed and psychotic female lead who just so happens to have many redeeming qualities...and an itty bitty crush on Yukii. Yuno could never be a harem girl simply because she would kill all the other competition...yay monogamy. I'll shut up about Yuno and let you judge for yourself but I'd just like to emphasize how substantive her character is. Unlike Ein from Phantom, who was pretty much an emotionally empty blank slate, Yuno knows what she wants... \
Yukii was harder for me to like (maybe it’s a guy thing). There is no shortage of anime that start with a wimpy, insecure male protagonist but something about Yukii seems particularly pathetic and angsty. Maybe the beanie? Maybe the high-pitched voice? The nonstop CRYING! But… as he begins to develop as a character he becomes slightly more likeable. *sigh* It’s a long journey. Fortunately, even if Yukkii is a wussy at times, it just creates more space for Yuno’s personality to shine.\
Side Characters: I really liked the way the way the other contestants were built up. Every one of them is unique, memorable and deadly in his/her own way. There were certain characters that had me laughing out loud. I also appreciate how the series devoted a number of flashbacks that explored the backgrounds of many of the side characters. If I had one complaint it's that I did find Yukki’s friends and his family to be a little boring. I would have liked them to have been more fleshed out and believable. \
Art 9: I really liked the animation. I’m a complete layman when it comes to critiquing anime art but the animation seemed sharp and the color contrast was extremely striking to me. I especially liked the way the character’s eyes were drawn. It’s hard to describe but they would often add an extra iris for effect (creating terror and crazy eyes). It was perfect for me and something I don't remember seeing in other anime.\
Sound: 9 I liked the first intro song much more than the second. This is purely a matter of personal preference. The only other part that annoyed me was just Yukkii’s high pitched voice. I really wish they could have cast a male lead an octave deeper. Once again this is just me being picky.\
Enjoyment 9: I loved this anime. It’s exactly what I wanted to see, which was a bizarre romance with a lot of dark, twisted action and suspense. \
Overall: Has everything I want in an anime\
\
Misc:\
Violence/gore: Lots of blood and collateral damage.\
Love/Romance: atypical love story. Yukki/Yuno’s relationship is a big focus of the series.\
Sex/Nudity: *sigh* Lots of undergarments, cleavage and panty shots. I actually wish they toned it down a bit. I found it weird that they are all supposed to be 14 but Yukki has the voice of a 12 year old and Yuno has the body of an 18 year old…Welcome to the confusing world anime…",

    Okay. Let me start off by saying this reminds me of Deadman Wonderland. And that's not a good thing. The art of Mirai Nikki is great, no doubt about that. No doubt about the sound either. But, obviously, since my overall rating is a 4, I'll talk about the stuff that really made me \"wat\" this entire series. Already. \
The story:\
4/10. Imagine you thinking about an imaginary world when you're alone. Now, you've thought of a God. A God that rules over time and space. Because he is a God, he can do whatever he wants, so he is now reality! Following? Good. This God\
          \
        is no kind God, he likes to mess things up. And so he does. He gives twelve people a diary. Not just any diary - a diary in the form of a cellphone, which predicts the feature of the owner up to 90 days in advance. \
If you're bound to trip at 1pm on Monday, and you do, nothing happens. If, however, you know this, and take another route or make a jump where you're supposed to trip, the future changes, and this will reflect upon the future diaries. If your cellphone is broken, your future is gone, so in short: you're dead. The God sends all 12 on a quest, a game if you like, to survive. If you are the last man standing, you are the successor to his throne. Okay, sounds cool, right?\
Well, no, not really. The main character, Yukiteru, is nothing but a wimp. Just like the main character in Deadman Wonderland. I'll have to look into who produces this show, but this can't be a coincidence. Yukiteru is a loner. His class consists of average people. Everyone wears shorts, jeans, skirts, proper shirts, shoes, has a 'real' hair color. All but one. Yuno. Yuno is a girl who wears a skirt that's seriously too short, and with bright pink hair. Oh, oh, guess who's going to co-star in this anime? Right. The pink-haired girl obviously.\
Okay, to go on: Yukiteru reads his diary, sees he is going to die by \"Third\" and reads what is going to do. Example: 12:40 - I notice I'm followed. 12:45 - I'm still being followed. 12:48 - I run into a closed off building. 12:50 - I die. Now, this shitface KNOWS the future is accurate, and what the FUCK does he do? He runs into the goddamn building while he just passed dozens of people walking down the street, where he'd be safe. \
Seriously, if you like pointless, unreal violence, to the point where it's just too much and it's silly, this anime is for you. If you're not - walk away. Fast.\
My opinion:\
This anime should be avoided by those who wish to see that things make sense. I cannot comprehend why this anime would get a 8,24/10 after the first episode. Nothing is wrong with settings in unrealistic universes and what not, but this is just a big no. \

The story is unique and interesting. The idea of seeing your future diary and fighting others with similiar abilities makes an great action and psychological anime. It is full of twists. If you liked death note or Steins;Gate then you will definetly love this! \
This is not one of the usual\

    Now let me get this out of the way, I'm not the biggest horror anime fan, but this anime is only bit scary first. Let me broaden the animes I watch, which are basically more of the cheerful ones.\
Let me go through the storyline first. The story is basically about a kid, Yukiteru, who I guess we could call a \"Loner\" dare I say. All Yukiteru does is type into his cell phone diary about random things he does throughout the day. Broadening more on the loner character, Yukiteru has \"imaginary friends\". One of those friends, Deus Ex, is the god of space and time\
          \
        (if I recall).  Now this is where it gets tricky. this god gives Yukiteru a cellphone that pretty much predicts everything he's going to do, just, random things. To make things even more complicated, his classmate, Gasai Yuno, also has one of these special cell phones, except her's is basically she knows what happens to Yukiteru in the near future. After certain events, both Yuki and Yuno get teleported into the \"imaginary\" dimension and see 9 other silhouettes of people. This is basically where the story gets even more intense. Basically, Deus Ex is on the verge of ceasing to exist and needs someone to take his place. So he gathers these 12 people to play a survival game to decide who will become the next \"god\". These 12 players use their special phones with different powers to play the game and try to beat each other which is of two ways: 1. you kill them or 2. you break their phone.\
I also liked the art style of this anime. now again, I usually watch the more cheerful animes so I definitely thought the art style was good. The only reason I rated this a 9 was because the art style does not fit the atmosphere of this anime as its literally about people killing each other, and it gets extremely complicated and dark later on. To be honest, I didn't know jack shit about this anime as I came across this anime from watching a different series. At first it does fit the atmosphere, but boy do you quickly throw away that thinking.\
Regarding sound, I thought the sound was extremely well done. The OST for this series is probably one of my favorite, even out of movies and non anime shows. To name a few songs, the sad piano music just fits every sad part. I swear I get the feels everytime I hear that song come on. The Epic Battle Theme was another favorite and its just intense. If you're not going to watch this anime, at least listen to the OST, I promise you, you'll like it.\
Characters (a bit of spoilers) , there are a few notable characters I liked. 12 amused me a lot. I totally thought he was crazy and gonna be scary, but the way he introduced himself to the main characters was just funny. My favorite has to be Akise Aru, I can't really go into him that much if I don't want to spoil it. I'll just say he's an extremely smart person and just has a cool aura around him. 9th was another cool character. Deus Ex is probably the biggest troll character I've come across, you'll understand once you watch. 7th probably gave me the most feels out of any of the characters.\
Overall, I enjoyed this anime a lot. The storyline was extremely well executed, the music fit every scene and overall and extremely good OST. All of the characters except a few were likeable. I definitely recommend this anime to anyone, if you can get across just a bit of blood and one f*cked up part, you'll enjoy this anime, even if you don't watch these type of animes like me.\

    Everyday, the human body produces approximately four pounds of fecal matter. That fecal matter goes into our sewage system and is eventually used as compost for crops. Sometimes, that shit does not end up in the sewer, but it lands on paper. Sometimes people don't know what shit looks like as it comes and different forms. This turd took the form of Mirai Nikki.\
Aside from the vulgar metaphor, Mirai Nikki is an awful show. It fails on every level: sound, characterization, pacing etc. This show is abysmal.\
The characters are very badly developed. Yukiteru, the male protagonist, is one of the worst protagonists in recent memory.\
          \
        He is whiny, abrasive and too trustworthy. He makes decisions that defy basic logic and reasoning. He is also bipolar and switches personalities every five seconds. The female protagonist, Yuno, is just as bad. She is a psychologically disturbed, stalker, who needs some kind of help. But the writers try to romanticize her mental illness by making her come off as overly affectionate. This couple has one of the worst chemistry I have ever seen.\
The side characters are all very bad. Apparently, the writer thinks if these characters are raped or tortured in some way, that some how makes them sympathetic characters. They are not. The way rape is used in this show is disgusting and crude and makes you wonder how anyone with a decent IQ can enjoy this show in any intellectual capacity.\
There are no themes that make this show worth it. There are plot holes the size of mount olympus and it poor integrates all the elements of a successful thriller. The tension dissipates after the first couple episodes. There are jarring moments between comedy and drama. Comedy shouldn't be in this show in the first place. The premise is also flawed to begin with. \
This show is very bad and shouldn't be watched, unless you want to laugh at how terrible it is.\
I give it 3 wipes of 10 wipes total. Which means, your butt still isn't clean...had to bring the metaphor back.\

    Have you ever had a crush on someone? Did you ever have the courage to ask them out, or did you just stand by and watch him/her from afar? Then you start to ask yourself questions: What does this person do on a daily basis? What are their likes/dislikes? Do they like someone else? How far are you actually willing to go to know more about this person?\
These are the themes present in Mirai Nikki. Sometimes, crushes can evolve into love, and sometimes, love can evolve into dangerous affection.\

        -Story & Characters-\
Yukiteru Amano (Yuki) is a typical young teenager: He goes to school every day, he goes home, does his homework, goes to bed, wakes up, rinse and repeat. Yuki doesn’t really like to mingle with other people and keeps to himself, writing down what goes on in his life in a journal on his cell phone. Yuki’s only friends are a pair of imaginary super-beings: Deus Ex Machina, the god of the universe, and a little girl named Murmur. Yuki’s simple life is suddenly flipped upside-down when Deus gives him a “Future Diary”, a bizarre power given to his cell phone, which allows him to predict future events. After coming to the realization that Deus and Murmur were, in fact, very real, he learns that he was selected by Deus to participate in a battle-royale against eleven other people who also possess Future Diaries. Deus, the god of the universe, is starting to decay, and if a winner, who will take the place of Deus as the new god, is not chosen by the end of the tournament within 90 days, Deus will die, and the world will end. \
The main heroine, Yuno Gasai, is also a participant in the tournament. However, Yuno has a twisted love for Yuki, and wants to ally with him to take on the other Diary Users together. While it does seem like Yuno’s affection for Yuki is random, her reasons for her twisted behavior are justified after a huge plot twist at the end of the show. While the story of the show isn’t terribly original, the concept of Future Diaries and being able to predict future events takes a very tired battle-royale setting and makes it its own. The show also has a good dose of humor to balance out the overall serious tone of the story.\
However, the harsh reality is that the story is not perfect, as the show has several plot holes and unanswered questions. For instance, we’re told that Yuki has been in contact with Deus and Murmur, who thought that they were a figment of his imagination. How did he meet them? How long have they been in association with each other? What do they talk about on a daily basis? Just how are these Diary Users selected? \
There are also two very weak (and silly) arcs during the show’s first half, which really hamper the experience. That’s not to say that the first half is bad, because it’s not at all. In fact, those two arcs aside, it’s really quite engaging. However, the saving grace for the show is its amazing second half, which really cranks the story up a few notches, throwing in some unexpected twists and heart-wrenching, powerful moments. Throw in some really great character development to go along with it, and you have a very memorable second half. \
The characters are what really drive the narrative forward, however. While there are maybe one or two characters that were kind of annoying *cough* Reisuke *cough*, the overall cast is quite likeable. Yuki is a strong lead, and acts as the confused, conflicted, and frightened hero. His reaction to the events around him are perfectly natural, and the fact that he has a crazy stalker that follows him around only makes his reasons all the more justified. Yuno goes to extreme lengths to keep Yuki in her sights, and hates it when he socializes with anyone that isn’t her, and even goes as far as trying to kill his friends. The rest of the cast is likeable as well. However, if you’re familiar with Black Lagoon, there is one character that is a complete rip-off of Revy: Uryuu Minine. Strong, aggressive, and stubborn, she is completely, utterly, 100%, no bones about it, Revy, making it feel like the writers had lost their creativity. \
Faults aside, the story is well-told, well-paced, and interesting throughout, and once you reach the show’s second half, you will not be able to keep your eyes off of the screen. \
\9                  -Visuals & Sound-\
Mirai Nikki is relatively new, coming out in 2011. While its visuals aren’t really up to par with some of the other shows that have come out around that time, it’s still relatively attractive. The characters in particular are very well drawn and move with great fluidity. \
The show’s audio, on the other hand, is easily its strongest aspect. The voice acting is absolutely superb, with the sole exception of Yuno, who, while not bad, sounded a lot deeper and didn’t quite fit her character, and it took a long time for it to grow on me. Aside from her, though, the voice acting was top-notch, there was no overacting, and everyone sounded, most importantly, believable. The music is of equal quality, with every song perfectly matching the situation that it accompanies. Even out of context, the individual songs themselves are just incredibly memorable, ranging from soothing acoustic guitar melodies to epic scores, and the soundtrack as a whole just as so much variety and is brimming with creativity. I highly recommend checking out the soundtrack alone, if that’s your thing.\
\9\9-Conclusion-\
In the end, Mirai Nikki is a flawed gem. It has plot holes and inconsistencies, yet its tale is still captivating. It’s not visually stunning, but its audio is terrific. Everything Mirai Nikki does wrong is counteracted by something it does right. While it’s not perfect, honestly, if you don’t watch it, I do truly feel that you’re missing out on something special. Would I recommend Mirai Nikki to any anime fan out there?\
Absolutely. \

    Something that I've seen all too often and which disappoints me greatly in all forms of media, whether it be anime or not, is when an anime has an extremely intriguing and unpredictable story but fails to execute it in a manner befitting of how good the actual story is. And sadly enough, Mirai Nikki is one such series which pains me to watch due to how poorly executed its good story is. However, personally, Mirai Nikki was still an absolute blast to watch due to the unpredictable nature of its story and the rather strange but extremely interesting cast of characters.\
Story: 6/10\
Mirai Nikki focuses\
          \
        primarily on Yukiteru Amano or Yuki for short, a cowardly and lonely boy who for some strange reason, keeps a diary of everything that happens around him on his phone. He is involuntarily thrown into a Hunger Games-esque fight to the death by Deus Ex Machina, the God of space and time, in order to determine the successor to his throne. Each of its twelve contestants is given a future diary which aids them in seeing the future. It is then that he meets and teams up with Yuno Gasai, a beautiful grade A student who is actually a psychotic and obsessive bitch... to put it lightly. \
Sounds rather simple right? Yes. Yes it does. But what makes Mirai Nikki's story so intriguing and addictive is that it isn't just a simple kill-everyone-to-win sort of story. The story actually has depth. Not all the characters have the desire to become a god. Some characters see the benefit of creating alliances instead of killing at first sight. A few of the characters have a sense of morality and help those who they are meant to kill. All these small additions of character to the anime create depth and gives the story substance.\
Furthermore, the story also includes many, many, many plot twists, probably too many for a 26 episode anime. While most of make sense to a certain degree ane one of them completely blew my mind (I'm sure it will blow yours too), almost all of them contained some sort of plot hole, some unexplainable plot device, or an inconsistency. I can't even count the number of times I asked a question that I knew would be answered on my own two hands. Eventually, and metaphorically speaking, the anime gets to a point in the story where people start gaining the ability to fly, aliens start attacking the earth, and it turns out your neighbour is Satan. Well, that might as well happen, given that very few things are explained well, if explained at all, in this anime.\
Another extremely disappointing thing to note about Mirai Nikki is the after credit scenes. Initially, it is explained that the afte credit scenes would be used to give backstory, information about some scenes during the episodes, or some details on something you might not have picked up during an episode. I only recall one time where the after credit scenes were useful; in the first or second episode where it helped the viewer piece together a few events which might not have been linked together by the viewer. Otherwise, every single after credit scene is just a sorry excuse to add some humour to every episode.\
Characters: 7/10\
Every single character in Mirai Nikki is unique and interesting in their own way. The contestants participating in this game to the death range from a blind vigilante to a well known terrorist to a blood thirsty kid. Sadly enough, very few of the characters are explored at all and none of them aside from Yuki, Yuno, and 9th receive any meaningful character development. The character development they do receive is terrible, hardly related to the overall story at all, and could've made way for explanations of the many unexplainable plot devices.\
Now I would have given the characters a higher score, probably an 8/10, but the creators of Mirai Nikki are perverted. I'm a guy but the amount of female nudity and fan service they chucked into Mirai Nikki, which is there just for the sake of it being there, is uncomfortable and just disgusting. Not only that but they also ran out of ideas when it came to many of the female characters' backstory. They essentially told themselves that if they wanted their supporting female cast to have troubled pasts, that they should say they got raped, put a scene suggesting as such, and leave it at that.\
For the most part, Yuki's development as a main character is extremely inconsistent. At times he becomes the world's most confident man and at other times, he is the world's biggest coward. On the other hand, 9th's development is a little better, which really doesn't mean anything in the grand scheme of things. By the end of the story, she is a completely different person to the one you first meet but the events which caused her to change so much are strange and somewhat unexplainable.\
The one extremely bright spot in the cast of characters is Yuno, though I do understand that many, many people will not like her. Her unpredictable and secretive nature was what really helped make the story so intriguing. When every character was more or less established in their roles, Yuno was that one character who continually had something new pull from under her sleeve. She receives a huge amount of character development, all of which adds fuel to her unpreictable fire and sets up for a plot twist which, as I have previously stated, blew my mind away.\
Art & animation: 9/10\
The art in this anime is honestly nothing special and I honestly wasn't impressed with most of it. There are, however, a few small details, especially in a few of the future diaries, which did catch my eye quite a few times.\
The animation, on the other hand, is a lot more impressive. During the fight scenes, which need to be animated well in anime like these, was fluid and nice to watch. Other animation techniques like the splattering of blood and the eyes of \"death\" (a name I gave to the eyes that Yuki gets when he realises something bad or when Yuno goes into full-psycho mode) are also really well done.\
Sound: 8/10\
First opening. Great. Quality listen in my spare time. Second opening. Not so great. There's just something about English lyrics being sung by a Japanese person that I don't like but that's just personal preference. The background music is brilliant, especially combined with the animaiton. It always helped create the atmosphere, whether it be during a fast paced battle or when a psychotic Yuno is stalking you.\
The voice acting (I watch Mirai Nikki dubbed) is actually somewhat good. Yuno was portrayed perfectly. She always sounded cute but you could also always hear that hint of psycho in her. Yuki was also portrayed well. During the emotional or horrifying moments, Yuki was full of emotion and his voice broke a lot, adding a bit more realism to his character. The supporting characters weren't as good. However, you didn't see most of them enough to really judge if their voice acting was good enough or not and I honestly didn't care if they weren't going to show up that much.\
Enjoyment: 9/10\
Personally, the only things which bugged me about this anime were the questions which kept managing to ask but never received answers to and the ridiculous amount of fan service. Otherwise, I was constantly on the edge of my seat, always wanting to see what plot twist would come my way. For most of the anime, I overlooked the plot holes, inconsistencies, and unexplained plot devices, and was able to enjoy what this anime had to offer. If you, unlike me, cannot stand a poorly executed story, then I suggest you turn away from Mirai Nikki. Otherwise, I highly recommend that everyone else watch this anime.\
Hope you found this review helped! Any feedback is much appreciated.\

Preface: \
Mirai Nikki is another show that needs no introduction. #16 in raw popularity, and one of the most talked about anime alongside Death Note, Code Geass, and Elfen Lied- it's one that's left its mark on the medium, and is certain to be discussed for as long as there people\
          \
        around to watch it. While the popularity is certainly deserving, Mirai Nikki is nowhere near a perfect show, though it does have some interesting characters.\
\
Artwork and Animation: 8\
Asread, a studio I admittedly had never heard of prior to this show (but also responsible for the popular horror series Corpse Party) did a nice job bringing Mirai Nikki to life. While there are some obvious places that corners were cut with super low detail character models and stillframes with no pans, when it springs into action, it looks great. The backgrounds and attention to detail in certain environments are very well illustrated. A rather dark palette was used for a chunk of the show to match the tone, but all in all, it's a very vibrant looking piece of art. \
One point of note is the use of cel-shade in Mirai Nikki. I've seen a lot of other reviewers and watchers mistakenly refer to the art style that Deus and his realm are rendered in as 3D CGI. Cel shade is not 3D CGI. It's what's known as a \"non photorealistic\" rendering. Also referred to as flat-D or 2.5D, Cel shading uses less gradients and shading to give art a comic book feel, rather than a wholly 'realistic' look, as seen in the ufotable produced \"Fate\" series.\
\
Sound and Voice Acting: 9\
I watched both sub and dub, and I have to say, game set and match- English. \
Perhaps the sub translation that I watched was just poor (HorribleSubs was responsible), but the subtitled version had little to no emotional pull to it like the English did. It was entirely more heartfelt in English, and the word choice and elucidation from Zach Bolton's script made it a 'smarter' watch in my native tongue than in Japanese. While some moments were decidedly darker in English than Japanese, I never got the feeling that Yuno was any creepier or more insane \"sounding\" in Japanese than English. Given that part of the whole allure of the series is how nuts this main character is, it was a no brainer to watch it in what is familiar- and turned out to be better sounding. Josh Grelle's (Armin, AOT) Yuki was a much more ninnyboy middle schooler sound than Togashi Misuzu's. Brina Palencia (Holo, Spice and Wolf, Touka, Tokyo Ghoul) as Yuno was perhaps not the best casting, but again, Yuno sounded like an irrationally lovestruck middle school girl. She was a touch robotic at times, but overall good. \
The intros and outros are all excellent tunes- upbeat J-rock tunes that were obviously written for the show, but still nice. \
\
Characters: 8\
Just as there will always be a debate about Lelouch's fate at the end of Code Geass, there will also be a near constant flame war between the fans and critics of one Yuno Gasai. Though Mirai Nikki was not the first, nor the anime that popularized the \"Yandere\" girl trope, it's definitely the most notable example. Calling Yuno Gasai a crazy bitch is only an infinitesimally small scratch on the congealed blood mountain of the unhinged, deranged, and confusing persona that she is. \
Where some decry her as a shallow, plot-armored convenience, others claim her to be a complex mess of abilities, emotions and mental states only theoretically possible. Like some one-off case discussed in a Crime and Deviance or Abnormal Psychology class, or something.\
Yuno, to me, exhibits what I see to be a very middle school perspective of the concept of love. Anyone who's been through middle school has seen these types of relationships- the ultra clingy, violent protectiveness and absolute adoration of boyfriend and girlfriend to/on each other. With this in mind, and given the supposed age of the characters involved, this works within the context of the show. A 15 year old's idea of what a healthy relationship is often vastly differs what someone even 18 would think- not to mention 25, 40, and on up. \
Love is irrational they say, and everyone knows that hormonally imbalanced and impulsive teenagers are too... unless you're one of them- then you just talk about that \"crazy couple that's all over each other\".\
What is Yuno? Yuno is all of these things, and more. Sure, Yuno has some crazy skills that no 15 year old girl should possess. Sure, Yuno gets out of a lot of situations that would mean hers or anyone else's ass were she not necessary in the story. But, in a story where there's a character named, literally, Deus Ex Machina, and people have phones that enable them to tell the future, there's already a suspension of disbelief going here. \
-----\
The supporting cast steals the show at times though, particularly Minene Uruyu, a fan favorite. Uryuu is probably the most compelling character in the show, and one that gets a lot of characterization where others lack it. \
Unfortunately for the show, or perhaps as a means of making it more depressing is that everyone in the show has a grimdark past, not always for good reason. Kind of like how in Elfen Lied, with Mayu's abusive past shown just to kick the puppy, Mirai Nikki has several Mayus. First on the list is Tsubaki- who is like Sakura Matou level woobie. Crappy past, crappy present, and unnecessarily dark. Everyone who's a diary wielder, with the exception of 8th and 11th are either horrible people, or have been heinously abused in the past... or both. Basically anyone who has a flashback (and there are a lot of these) is going to have been a kicked puppy. \
\
Story: 6\
Where Mirai Nikki loses some points are the wild plot twists that take place in the last three episodes (not counting the OVA as a 27th episode). If I had not watched all three back to back, or had even so much as gotten up to get a drink during them, I would come back and been wondering what Yuki, Yuno, and the gang were doing in another show that had the exact same art style as Mirai Nikki. Seriously, sharks get jumped, and some real screwballs get thrown out there. What was a fairly consistently paced and twisted ride from episode 1 to 23 suddenly became a wormhole to another dimension where the title of the anime was Mirai Nikki, but what was going on was... not. A little Dragon Ball Z, a little Steins Gate, a little Donnie Darko, a smattering of nonsense, and a whole lot of \"what??\" happen in the last three episodes, but they do lead to a rather satisfying conclusion, particularly with the addition of the Mirai Nikki Redial OVA, which lends a new perspective to the final moments of the series. \
Mirai Nikki is strong in that it keeps the viewer on their toes, or edge of their seat. It's not one of those shonen anime where every enemy that's defeated joins the crew and friendship prevails- it treats its characters harshly and with permanent results. While the setup of the death/survival game rings of an ensemble cast type setting, Mirai Nikki takes a slightly different path of arcs, with some overlapping characters. This works well for the show, and kept it from being needlessly convoluted with a lot of characters with disparate motives and threads of plot in every episode. It enabled the show to stay more focused on the conflict at hand and allow the complexity to grow as it went on instead of being all at once.\
\
Enjoyment: 10 \
The Future Diary's popularity likely stems from its method of presentation- a very accessible teen drama with a lot of mature content- ultraviolence and nudity, along with an exciting plot with a rather unexpected conclusion. All in all, Mirai Nikki is a very electrifying and enjoyable watch- imagine a mix of the supernatural, a modern day Romeo and Juliet tale, then mixed with Natural Born Killers, were Woody Harrelson less unhinged and more of a sissy. It's a story of irrational love, and at the same time one of despair and how sick humanity can be for the sake of power over others. Definitely a show I'll remember well into the future.\
\
Overall: 8 \
\
Recommended?\
Certainly. Mirai Nikki is a twisty drama chock full of darkness and violence, but not relentlessly depressing. For those who find the Yandere girl trope interesting, this is a must see. For those who just want an exciting and fun but rough show - this is another good fit. Plenty of blood, guts, and angst to go with the mysterious and supernatural elements- just don't expect it to be grounded in reality. ",

    Mirai Nikki is an anime that has a fantastic premise with a lot of potential. The basis for the anime is that the god of the world (Deus ex Machina) is dying and has chosen 12 people as potential successors. They are each given a Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) with its own set of abilities and are told to play a survival game in which the last individual standing will become god. Each diary's ability gives the user a specific edge against their competitors whether it's being able to track down individual just by knowing their name or being able to predict attempts on their\
          \
        own lives. The catch to this is that the destruction of your own diary will instantly kill you. Now this sets up for a lot of interesting plot moments and a message that centres around the morality of it all that's rather subtle and carefully executed. The biggest problem with the story is it has many glaring plot holes. I can't mention many of them for the sake of spoilers, but the most glaring one in the show is they never explain why Deus ex Machina is dying or why he needs humans to be his successors. The plot holes really bring down a fantastic story to the point I can only say that it's good.\
The art in this show is great. Animation is almost always clean and fluid showing marks of an anime that had a great budget going for it. The models are almost always anatomically correct and the backgrounds normally look great too. It doesn't stand out, but does an impeccable job at conveying scenes to a high degree of effectiveness.\
The music in this show is amazing. Every track represents its corresponding scene perfectly. Some tracks don't just compliment, but improve the scenes themselves whether that be through intensity or subtlety (Track 7 on the 5th ost really stands out when mentioning the score). This anime has one of the best osts I've heard and deserves very high amounts of praise for the amount of quality present here.\
I'm going to be blunt here. If you have any reason to watch this show, it should be for the characters. The other aspects of the show are well done, but compared to the amount of depth they give to the back-stories and personalities of these people who were chosen to participate in this game, you could take them all away and still have a solid show. You could choose any character in this show as your favourite and it would be just as valid as picking anyone else. Every single character manages to be interesting in some way even if they're only present for about 10 minutes of the show. This is a rarity not only in anime, but in many mediums such as American cinema or fantasy novels. I can't emphasize enough that these characters are what make this show a good watch as a whole.\
This show is actually very enjoyable. It isn't the most enjoyable thing I've ever watched, but it deserves high placement for how it handled itself. It even had me on the edge of my seat in more than a few episodes as I was very interested in what was going to happen next. \
Overall, this anime deserves a solid 8/10. If the plot were cleaned up and better executed, it would probably be deserving of a 9 or maybe even a 10. What's preventing me from giving above an 8/10 is that story and plot are the most important things for a show like this to have. With that in mind, I would still recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the genre. It is a very good show and is worth your time.\

    There are some shows that somehow manage by on sheer energy alone. Their plotting could be messy, their pacing uneven, their characters inconsistent, etc.; yet they are just so damn entertaining. Mirai Nikki definitely is definitely one of those shows. It is a floundering, unruly mess that often dives into nonsense in its attempt to shock and woo the audience. There is also nary a dull moment in this incoherent storm of blood and violence.\
The concept of the show is really quite cool. It centers around a tournament in which contestants are given diaries that show them the future, or more accurately certain future events\
          \
        that adhere to each diaries specific theme. The winner gains mastery over space and time as the successor of the current god; for the losers all that awaits is death. This all comes as a shock to Yukiteru \"Yuki\" Amano, an asocial middle school student who becomes the first diary holder; he is reluctantly forced into the competition, equipped a diary which gives him a description of his current and future surroundings. He also gets a shock when he finds out a beautiful and seemingly perfect girl in his class, Yuna Gasai, is also a diary holder. On top of that, she turns out to be obsessed with Yuki, and her diary records his every move. As unsettling as this is to Yuki, Yuno might be his only ally and hope to survive the gruesome competition.\
Mirai Nikki has to be given credit for taking this idea and running with it. The show never drags because the plot is constantly moving, more often than not at a break-neck pace. It wastes no time in bringing story arcs to their climax and moving on to the next one, satisfying everyone's impatient inner adrenaline junkie. There are twists and turns around every corner, many you just won't see coming. The show also does a good job of building tension, and anticipation for the insanity that will ensue. The fact that the show is bat-shit crazy only adds to the excitement of the ever moving plot. The tone can go from tense to comical and back again in a moment. There are a lot of things Mirai Nikki  can be accused of, but being boring is not one of them.\
The problem, however, is where Mirai Nikki is running to. The plot is constantly moving, but that doesn't mean its going in a good direction. In fact, the reason you won't see some plot twists coming is because they seemingly pop out of nowhere, or are so improbable you wouldn't even consider them. It seems as if the writer was so intent to throw in as many shocks and thrills in as possible, that he forgot to put together a cohesive plot. There are things that happen which are just mind-bogglingly ridiculous. Some twist will leave you confused on whether to be shocked or amused, despite the tone clearly pointing toward the former, because of how silly they are. Some twists are also so obviously intended to move the plot along that it is a bit insulting to the viewers' intelligence. There are moments which attempt to be to poignant, but fail to because they are blatantly made for plot convenience. Mirai Nikki is entertaining, but its best to view with your brain turned off.\
The cast of characters is a colorful bunch. Our protagonist Yuki is one of the more mentally stable in the show, but he is also one of the dullest. He's a typical male anime lead. He's a bit wimpy, has trouble connecting with other people and fighting his own fights, though deep in he is a nice kid. We've seen this character so often, and it is all Yuki can be described as, really. The other competitors in the tournament range from being fairly rational to outlandishly insane. A police captain who is the fourth diary holder stands out as the most rational, and possibly most sympathetic, of the group; while the twelfth diary holder, a blind man who fancies himself a hero and likes super sentai, stands out as one of the craziest.\
Then there is Yuno, who takes the idea that crazy is cute to a new level. Yuno's infatuation with Yuki engulfs her entire character. She is willing to eliminate any obstacle, and I do mean any at all, that gets between her and Yuki. On one hand, this makes her very entertaining to watch, since she's willing to go to any extreme to be with him, even if it is against his will. Plus, she just looks so cute when she's stalking Yuki, or contemplating murder of someone she sees as a threat. However, she's so crazy it is actually hard to connect to her on a deep level. The story has to resort to giving her an extremely tragic past in order to justify her actions, something it does for a lot of its characters, I might add. Because of this, many of the dramatic moments that surround her, and there are a lot, are forced and a bit insincere. Also, her relationship with Yuki often comes off as unhealthy rather than sweet, which makes attempts to play it off as endearing more than a little unnatural.\
On the technical side, Mirai Nikki is a mixed bag. The show usually looks good, but can stray into off model character designs and choppy animation quite a bit too. Some scenes just look abysmal, clearly minimal effort was put into them and quality control is pretty much non-existent. Luckily, this only happens on occasion, and the show for the most part looks decent. Character designs look nice, though are not outside the norm for an anime series. Strangely enough the show looks best when the characters are going crazy. Likewise, backgrounds are solid, though the only really memorable one is Deus' lair. The lighting can be a problem, though, as it can look really unnatural at times. The soundtrack fairs better than the visuals. It's well composed and fits the tone well throughout the show. While it is mostly used to accentuate the looming danger in tense or creepy moments, it also does very well in the shows more emotional moments as well. It can even be uplifting on occasion.\
As entertaining as Mirai Nikki is, it cannot be completely congratulated. Truth be told, the story is a disaster. It is filled with plot holes and contrivances, and lacks genuine depth. Still, I can't say I didn't have fun watching it. There is something endearing about its willingness to go to such insane lengths in order to entertain. It's just a pity that the end result doesn't match its enthusiasm.\

    People overreact towards Mirai Nikki. Seeing the comments for the reviews here such as \"worst anime\", \"stupid\", \"annoying\", and so forth made me realize how belittled this series really is. With animes that reach Mirai Nikki's calibre in popularity, there's a slew of overly-critical reviews that follow that give unnecessarily bashful criticism that you would only see for popular animes exclusively. And with this said, this anime hasn't been given the justice it deserves and I've finally had enough. Mirai Nikki's one of favorites, and I've been attached to it ever since I completed it. And now I'm here to review one of my favorite\
          \
        animes and finally put it in some good light. \
Story 7/10 \
In my humble opinion, this is one of the more consistent aspects of the anime. Despite the rave over the anime, the story's not all that complex; it's nothing but a simplified version of Hunger Games. You have Yukki, the main character, who unwillingly participates in a battle royale game with a group of other contestants. Each contestant is called a \"diary owner\". The basic idea of the game is to survive and be the last one left standing. This basically invokes the principle \"kill or be killed\". Each diary owner has a device called a \"Future Diary\" which differs in abilities to help the contestant triumph through the game. If the diary is to be destroyed, the contestant dies and furthermore is out the game. \
Animation 8/10  \
There's not much to say about the animation. It's pretty standard; but it fits the anime perfectly.  \
Sound 7/10 \
Same with animation, it's pretty standard. Not much to comment here honestly \
Characters 6/10 \
Now this is the part that makes peoples' heads turn. The general consensus I've seen in a number of reviews about Mirai Nikki is that Yukki is a whiny brat. And as much as I want to, I can't disagree. Yukki starts off as a timid, anti-social boy who's always complaining - pretty linear to Shinji from Neon Genesis. And then there's Yuno, the selling point of this anime. She initially has an average-school girl sempai-chasing look and personality, admiring Yukki from afar and trying her best to get close to him. But as the game progresses, you notice her true personality comes out: a yandere. The girl's insane. The depths she goes to protect Yukki throughout the game are unbelievable and sometimes unsettling. And as the anime has aged she's become a classic example of a yandere character. And as for the side characters, they aren't relevant enough for you to care about their personalities as much as Yukki and Yuno. \
Enjoyment 10/10 \
I initially took my time watching Mirai Nikki, as I was watching other animes along with it at the time, but as I progressed into the series I became attached to it instantly. I found myself marathoning it at a pretty shocking rate. In terms of the thrill of this anime, I've only encountered a few that have matched it. Despite its faults it's amazingly entertaining. \
Overall 9/10 \
As you can see this show is a hit or miss for most people. The people who watch it are divided into two: ones who like it and one's who don't. And it's a good number of both on each side to say the least. And in saying that, I think it's best to try Mirai Nikki and see with your own eyes how you like it. \

    Overview:\
Mirai Nikki exploded on to the scene in 2011 and has built up quite the following. However, I have never liked this series and consider it one of the most overrated anime on this entire site! Mirai Nikki is one of those series that commits all the sins that other series get bashed for and somehow avoids any and all criticism. This is especially true on 4chan where Yuno has become something of a mascot and beloved icon. Although I almost admire the stubbornness and blind loyalty of its fanbase, I feel it is my duty to give this series the rich beating it deserves!\
Story\
          \
        and characters: 4/10\
Yuki is a very shy and introverted middle schooler that likes to talk to his imaginary friend, Deus ex Machina. One day he discovers that Deus is real and is in fact the God of this universe. However, God is getting old and needs a successor, so there is to be a Battle Royale to decide the heir. If no one wins than the apocalypse occurs. The bland and frankly awful main character Yuki quickly teams up with everyone's favorite yandare Yuno. Yuno for some reason has an obsessive love for Yuki and is willing to do anything to protect him. Why does she love him so much? No one knows. Yuno and Yuki go farther and farther into immoral territory and wish to win at all costs. Afterall, the winner can become God and simply bring back everyone that was killed. I won't spoil it, but the ending is one of the absolute stupidest endings I have ever seen! We should have seen this coming since the God is named Deus ex Machina, since no other words could describe how bullshit the ending was! What are my problems with the plot and characters? Firstly, Mirai Nikki doesn't simply homage other anime or adapt a subplot from a classic, but rather shamelessly steals from recent popular anime. It tries very hard to capture and emulate the cat and mouse games and high tension of Death Note, but fails because it isn't nearly as well written. This coming from someone who didn't even think Death Note was God tier writing in the first place. We have all seen the Battle Royale plot done a MILLION times before and written much better than the one in Mirai Nikki. We've seen the pink haired yandare girl gorily slaughter her way through dozens of people to get with bland male protagonist when it was Elfen Lied 7 years earlier in 2004. I could list other examples, but I don't want to write all day. The one thing I will give Nikki credit for is that it did do the sending text messages through time plot before Stein's Gate used it. The Mirai Nikki manga came out in 2006. Let's just face it, the characters fucking suck! The only character people like is Yuno, and she is honestly an extremely overrated character. Why? She kills without feeling or remorse and is a complete sociopath, yet we are supposed to like her. Her love for Yuki is completely unfounded and frankly doesn't make any sense. She has no real character depth and besides looking adorable killing people doesn't do anything to make anyone with a brain like her. We can't empathize with her, see into her head, or feel what she feels. Let's compare Yuno with her pink haired yandare predecessor Lucy from Elfen Lied. Lucy also has blind love for a fairly bland seeming protagonist, but she has a fucking reason to. He was the only person ever to treat her as a human being and show her kindness, after 10 years of encountering nothing but discrimination, fear, and hatred. Lucy kills plenty of innocent people, but feels deep remorse for these killings and realizes the gravity of her own crimes. Her feelings of guilt, psychological torment, and search for redemption makes the viewer actually able to empathize with her in a way that the viewer never can with Yuno. Keep in mind that  I'm not saying that being a sociopath = bad character. Johan Liebert of Monster is a sociopath, but is an amazing character. His bone chilling nihilism, mastery over manipulation and human emotion, and complete lack of reason for committing the crimes he does make him a terrifying pinnacle of human depravity and evil. Yuno is neither a great villian like Johan or a great anti-hero like Lucy. She is a very shallow yandare archetype that 4chan loves because lets face it, most of the people on /a/ are idiots and should GTFO my /b/! The final reason the plot is honestly pretty lousy is that it tries so hard to have the gore, rape, and darkness of a seinen(18 up demographic), but goes for the mindless happy ending of a shonen (12-17 demographic) where actions have no consequences and you can always just take a mulligan if you fuck up and did something you regret. Part  of what separates Shonen like Naruto and DBZ from Seinen like Monster and Elfen Lied is that if someone dies in a seinen series, they probably aren't going to be \"wished back\" next week. If a character makes a horrible mistake, that character has to live with it and doesn't simply get a do-over. Mirai Nikki is FAR too dark and depraved for a shonen but lacks the maturity, moral complexity, and intelligence of a good seinen. It enters into Tim Burton's Batman Returns territory where it is too dark for young kids and too stupid for adults.\
Art and sound: 7/10\
The art and sound are good, but not absolutely amazing and certainly not great enough to compensate for the shitty writing and characters. It looks good, but not revolutionary for its time period in 2006. The opening song is promising, but the overall OST is lackluster. \
Overall: 4/10\
To be fair, maybe I would feel different if I was younger and Mirai Nikki was my first dark and brutal anime. Maybe I would have been able to overlook its flaws like audiences did for early anime like Vampire Hunter D and Ninja Scroll simply because we were shocked and awed by what we were seeing. If you got something out of Mirai Nikki and found a strong moral, an empathetic character, thought provoking philosophy, or a bloody good time than good for you! I'm not going to condemn you and say that you are objectively wrong for liking this series. I will say that I personally hated this series and highly question if people are truly rating this series objectively and honestly. Of course there is no \"right\" and \"wrong\" when judging a subjective work of art, but it is my firm opinion that Mirai Nikki does NOT deserve a substantially higher rating than Elfen Lied and Angel Beats on MAL. It does NOT deserve to be ranked almost as high as Monster. I'm trying really hard to keep this review civil out of consideration for Mirai Nikki's many fans, but the fact it is rated above a 7 actually kind of pisses me off!\

    Last month, this would have gotten a 9/10.\
A number of recent circumstances bring it down to a 6/10.\
Though I admit I could see from the start that this series was going to be very predictable, it started off good for what it was, however, the events that occur now will only have the more impressionable (new to anime, new to the demegraphic, very young etc...) of us gripped.\
I'll explain further...\
Stroy...\
We have a Battle Royale style, supernatural story inwhich  characters  duke it out in game complex game of life and death which will eventually leave one person standing - death is enevitable.\
Where it goes\
          \
        right...\
There are a number of charactes present withiin the competition, so the pace isn't likely to be slow and there are a range of potential favourites.\
The methods in which the game is played are complex enough to gain and maintain interest - each character has a different tool, so it is importiant to follow what is going on.\
Many people don't like gecko endings - seeing as the manga finished, this is unlikely to have one.\
Where it goes wrong...\
Two main characters are pushed forward at the start, they're working together; it's all against them - where does this leave the oposition? \
All oposition seem to reside close by, when there's little reason for them not to recide on another part of the world. \
The two mains both being schoolchildren of the same age, in the same class.\
Character...\
We have Yuki - a quiet, nervous, passive teen boy who displays little personality and little interests.\
We have Yuno - an unhinged girl who is is in love with this boy for no particualr reason I recall.\
Delving further...\
Yuki is pretty much pathetic - the type who is ment to represent the common writing tools 'underdog' and 'normal school kid', yet his out-of-place self is highly inconvenient within this story, he's the type who'll hide behind the strength and/or skill of others, this is where Yuno comes into place - the 'highly intelligent' and 'very athletic' popular girl in school who turns to be a yandere, in love with the leading male, she now has the convenient task of 'being the one to protect her love', thus, giving them reason to be around one another.\
Enjoyment...\
It is good; one of the best of the year, yet personally, I think I'm a tad too old for this - everthing is predictable if you're a veteran like me.\
This is a great starter anime - years ago, I may have given this a 10/10.\
Overall...\
I have the ability to predict what will happen next, dispite having NOT read the manga.\
Good story - something different which is definetely worth the watch.\
Decent characters excluding a few, yet certian cliche's are hard to avoid these days to be fair. \
Depending on your anime intake, predictability is high; this series displays key example of plot armour and character sheild.\
6/10 - a fair series that, at the moment, is at a stage (8 episodes) where it can only get better? \
I'll make myself clear before I finish...\
I knew of the manga a few years back, yet never got around to reading it. It was announced last year that this was getting an animated series, thus, this adaptation was highly conveinent for me. :P \
Basically, I was and still am, optimistic - I want to like this series, but so far, it's just OK.\

    This review contains mild spoilers.\
It's hard to bring up Mirai Nikki without mentioning how great its premise sounds on paper. A survival game between twelve diary users, all with different motivations and reasons, to overwrite the future and survive a thrilling game of wits, courage and luck. It's an excellent premise, but also tried and done to death (especially in recent years, thanks to the Hunger Games movies/novels).\
What often tends to be a deciding factor in them is how to make characters feel human, their panic and sense of calm in between feel real, and well...just not feel too extreme, really. A basic understanding of\
          \
        human psychology is required to capture that, and it requires a lot of solid character writing to accomplish that.\
Oh, and there is also the (arguably) equally important plot armor aspect. A lot of what makes survival games so intense and thrilling to sit through is the unpredictability of what happens next. However, that can be sacrificed if the actual show has a script solid enough to carry through and excuse all the questionable incidents that occur over the course of the show.\
Mirai Nikki fails in every single way, and it is easily among the most anti-climactic series I've ever seen. The script mocks me constantly for taking it seriously, yet takes itself more seriously than it can ever dream of being self-aware of.\
The storyline goes nowhere past the basic premise, and there is no theme whatsoever to think about. The show pretends that there is the whole theme about \"being able to dream of future and fight for it\" and all that, but honestly, the show never foreshadows that theme til very late onto the show, as well as the ending, well, pretty much contradicting that.\
Did I mention how much plot armor this show has? No seriously, any situation Yuki and Yuno are put into they manage to walk out of with little to no harm, and there is no real suspense once you realize that there is a particular formula which is pretty much that Yuno and Yuki come across one of the other twelve, that person either pretends to be an ally or becomes an enemy (don't expect any reasonable explanation either) and then they defeat that person only for a period of calm to come and then the cycle repeats itself again.\
Seriously, this show is in some ways the worst thing a survival game should be. It's predictable, formulaic, the script is a walking joke and the characters are equipped with enough plot armor that can make Ichigo from Bleach blush. The worst thing is that this show has absolutely no idea how to balance its quiet moments with its hectic ones, with the quiet moments coming off as forced or too quiet, and its hectic ones coming off as extremely over-the-top and silly.\
I also need to mention just how bad the script feels. It's bloody ridiculous, and some of what is permissible in this show can break any sane person's sense of disbelief. A terrorist blows up the school bit by bit and the show tells you that she is a terrorist with no real care for a human's life. Why? Just because. Why didn't she just blow up the whole school? A little kid tries to kill Yuno and Yuki with poison gas. Where did he get the poison gas? Who sold him the poison gas? Don't know? I don't think the show does either. I can go on and on, but I really don't want to spoil the entire show. Honestly props to anyone who somehow managed to suspend their disbelief for all this, it takes a lot to be able to manage that with a show like this.\
There is also the characters. Where do I even start? They behave irrationally, act like a pack of immature brats who can't fight their way out of a paper bag one moment and suddenly can do complete and utter miracles the next. There is so much inconsistency in their behavior that I'm not even sure they even can be considered \"characters\".\
The main characters are especially guilty of this. Yuki changes personalities to be whatever the plot demands him to be. He is normally a coward and a wimp, but you'd never guess that if you watched clips of his clashes with the various diary users over the course of the show. He is a wimp in the quiet moments of the show but becomes a complete badass when the plot demands it, and can throw darts with a surprising level of accuracy (which admittedly is foreshadowed early on). No matter how good you are at throwing darts, they can't be the Deus Ex Machina solution when all else fails. \
Yuno is no better, with her character being foreshadowed to simply having a crush on Yuki then later turning to be a complete and utter maniac who kills people for fun and games, simply because it makes the show more marketable and easy for people to not get bored. To be fair, she is entertaining (and the main reason I finished the show) but I'm not entirely sure that it's for the reasons the writer planned her to be. She changes personalities off the drop of a coin and her monologues boil down to \"this person looked at Yuki, I must kill them\" and \"this person is dangerous to Yuki, I must kill him\". She is completely defined by her relationship with Yuki, and as such never once feels like an actual character. The show does attempt to explain this and fails miserably, coming off as incredibly edgy and laughable at best.\
The side characters vary wildly, with most of them being every bit as stupid as our main duo, and others being pretty decent. I kind of like the detective in particular, his motivation was really easy to sympathize with and he is also the only person who was talking sense in the show. I could go on about other examples but I really don't want to spoil the whole show.\
A special mention needs to be addressed about how women are treated in this show, however. Every single woman in this show is sexually abused or raped, sometimes both, and there is literally no special thought put into making this work or its psychological consequences. \
Seriously, it's like the writer and the publishing company were thinking to themselves about how to give the female characters the harshest and most edgy back story possible, and they kept seeing rape and sexual abuse as the answer. It's absolutely disgusting.\
The soundtrack is unremarkable at best, with some very strange tracks being put in the wrong time, sound effects being poorly implemented and the voice acting sounding poor and inconsistent, with a lot of strange noises that actually made me laugh whenever a character is dying or put into any danger.\
The artwork is alright but nothing particularly remarkable to look at, with backgrounds looking really bland and the entire show looking as though everything is in a darker color simply because they wanted to make the show look dark, but coming off as incredibly edgy and (maybe I have bad eyes or something, I don't know) but I could swear that the character designs have this dark shade that is pretty nasty to look at. Seriously, why do that?\
A lot of people like Mirai Nikki. I kind of admire them for that, since there is so much that the show does wrong in my eyes that I found myself struggling to watch episode to episode. The story is stupid, the characters inconsistent and the themes non-existent.\
I honestly don't recommend this show, just watch the Fate series, read/watch the Hunger Games and read Battle Royale. I can assure you it's a better use of your time than this show if you're looking for some survival games. I'm not saying any of them are perfect, but they're way more satisfying to watch than this show.\

    Future Diary aka Mirai Nikki is a series about a middle school kid named Yukiteru who’s all observant and distant and disaffected. He, apparently, has some imaginary friends called Deus and Murmur. However, these imaginary friends turn out to not be so imaginary. Deus turns out to be the god of space and time. Not only that, he’s turned Yukiteru’s cellphone into one that can predict the future. Oh:  and there are also 11 other people who have this power, and now you have to kill each other so you can become my replacement as god.\
Though I think the series is largely uneven and,\
          \
        by its conclusion, has completely jumped the shark, I do think it touches on some rather interesting ideas; or, rather, the central relationship and the character behavior/personalities offer more to chew on than whatever the central conceit is supposed to do. The relationship between Yukiteru and Yuno (his love interest) arguably drives most of the series’ action, but it also highlights the series’ attitudes towards dependent/abusive relationships. This is the only interesting part of the show.\
Yukiteru’s diary and Yuno’s diary are oddly compatible, so they team up in order to survive the game. However, it’s less of a “team” and more of a “Yuno goes crazy any time Yukiteru is even remotely in danger.” The thrust of the entire relationship is thus: Yukiteru completely relies on Yuno to save his ass, and then feels horrible after she goes way overboard and kills everyone. Not only that, at points, Yukiteru almost begins to feel afraid for his life, that’s how intense Yuno is. Yuno pledges undying devotion and love and bodyguard services, and Yukiteru takes advantage of this, basically using her and lying to her, while benefiting from her protection. This dynamic is deeply screwed up.\
First of all, we have the way in which Yukiteru almost seems like an abused spouse character. Because of Yuno’s diary ability, he can’t really escape from her (she knows everything he’s going to do), and it’s because of this that he allows himself to think of her company and her actions as normal. She’s just trying to protect me and win the game (because she likes me). But every time that Yuno goes all ruthless and flies off the handle a little more than the previous time, Yukiteru has to keep making compromises and excuses for her. He’s told repeatedly by other people that she’s dangerous or that she’ll be the death of him. Little by little, her behavior becomes rationalized and coded as “normal” or “acceptable” and soon the feeling that this is what he has to deal with to survive becomes inescapable. He’s trapped in the relationship; Yuno keeps him safe, and he can’t get away even if he wanted to.\
Also of interest are any moments where there is opposition between Yukiteru and Yuno. There’s a particularly great episode where Yukiteru tries to make new, “normal” friends. They invite him out to take a look at a dead body (because that isn’t suspicious) and he cheerfully goes, because the prospect of getting away from what he knows is a toxic attachment to Yuno is mighty appealing. She tags along, but mostly watches from the sides, as Yukiteru laughs with everyone, cracks jokes, and whatnot. But then the narrative of the episode kicks in, and Yukiteru’s friends turn out to be not so friendly. Which is exactly what Yuno thought would happen. The drama of the episode is then about Yukiteru’s struggle to redeem this friendship, and make it real; and Yuno’s constant refusal to make friends with anyone else, throwing doubt on anyone who would get close to him, almost stabbing everyone whenever they do something unexpected. But this opposition never even lasts; Yukiteru’s too weak to ever put up much of a struggle. Even after everyone witnesses how crazy Yuno is, he still ends up making excuses for her. He’s terrified by her behavior, but he can’t quite say that he doesn’t need it. Yuno loves Yukiteru, wishes to protect him and all that; but it’s a love that’s selfish, possessive and obsessive. It’s a love that includes no one else. At points, it doesn’t even include Yukiteru. It’s her love alone.\
And, ultimately, Future Diary, if nothing else,manages to dramatize this unique dynamic very well. Although it often succumbs to ludicrous plot twists, silly Yandere antics, and literal deus ex machine shenanigans, the series manages to show how crazy and twisted this relationship is. The series’ denouement shows the utter ruination of the main character; he’s destroyed everything he loves for a lie. And still he lives a lie.\

    Mirai Nikki is a fine example on an anime starting great but then repeatedly trying as hard as it can to destroy everything that makes it good and bring on whole new levels of suckage.\
The concept is solid. A battle royale of the owner of mysterious future diaries which give people different powers, for the right of being the new \"God\" of this world. During the first 3-4 episodes I was on the edge of my seat but the more episodes I watched the lower my opinion of this show got. \
For starters we have our protagonist Yuki who is your cliche quite, pantsy type.\
          \
        He gets pushed into this conflict between the diary owners but himself lacks the motivation and reason to try to win this competition. What follows is Yuno being a brutal yandere and killing everything on her way.\
First of all let's talk about Yuno and Yuki's relationship. In the start of the series Yuki keeps Yuno with him for two reason: 1 - he needs her to survive and 2 - he actually falls for her a little and starts thinking that they can be togather even with her...unusual personality.\
As I said in the beggining it is played out in a good manner. Later it gets messed up and pretty hard (as well as the whole anime). Yuki keeps returning to Yuno and gives her numerous chances even if everytime she continues doing some insane stuff. Once she drugged him, tied him to a chair and locked him in the basement and after that he still continues to be with her and falls in love with her. I do not believe that a single sane person would continue to be with a person who drugged you and threw you in the basement...at least there was not rape.\
The relationships between this two character strat out good and even somewhat touching but later they become so unrealistic and so forced that towrads the end I could not even stand how idiotic was the protagonist to stay with her. And guess what it came back to bite him on his behind.\
The farther the show gets the more idiotic the protagonist becomes and he was not likable to begin with. This degression sadly also effects almost every other character in the show\
The rape, is a second issue I have with this series. There is more than 1 rape scene in the anime and numerous attempted rape scenes, as well as nudity scenes. Yes that's right. Not fanservice but straight up nudity which plays ABSOLUTELY no role most of the time. It's just there to have a naked chick in the show. \
The rest of the cast in this anime ranges from really good to walking gimmicks and carbon cutouts. Sadly exept for Yuno and Minene most of the other characters are either not interesting or are killed off after one or two episodes.\
Towards the final episodes the show becomes a horrible trainwreck with plotholes, characters acting stupid and out of nowhere time and dimension traveling.\
There are many other bad things in this show but it requires for me to go more in depth to explore them properly. \
There are good things about the show. The animation and overall austetics are good. The first opening is really nice but none of the other OST stands out. There are good things and moments but very few and far between. Overall the show kicked itself in the balls by trying out some very stupid things and concepts on top of the already poorly written characters.\

    Critic’s Diary - Earthdate: February 14, 2015. Review #93: The Future Diary\
\
People assume that time is a straight progression of cause to effect, but actually. From a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it’s more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly...timey-wimey...stuff. This anime is nothing like Doctor Who, Here’s The Future Diary!\
Yukiteru Amano is a loner who never really interacts with people and prefers writing a diary on his cell phone with his only companion being an imaginary friend named Deus Ex Machina, the God of Time and Space. However, Yuki soon learns that Deus is not a figment of his imagination when Deus makes him a\
          \
        participant in a Survival Game with other contestants, the participants are given special diaries that can predict the future with each diary having unique abilities that gives them both advantages and disadvantages.\
The Future Diary is animated by Asread and I have to be honest here. The animation is a mixed bag. The Character designs are ok I guess The 3D Animation shortcuts look awful and the movements can look a bit cheap at times. When the plot goes balls to the wall, the animation sometimes has its highlights. the animation will vary your mileage. Asread has not done a whole lot over the years as a studio and I can’t really say that Future Diary is their best show since… one, I have not seen a lot of their animation productions, and two… I stated before in my opinion that the animation is a mixed bag. However, there is a highlight... The First opening.\
Now I usually mention the soundtrack first before mentioning the opening and closing themes, a but The Future Diary is an exception. Most of you may find the first opening to be a highlight in the soundtrack and I would agree. It is pretty catchy. The first closing “Blood Teller” Is alright, but I sometimes skip the closing since it really doesn’t click for me. Halfway through the show, Future Diary just happened to replace its catchy first opening with a second opening and I didn’t like it as much, that and the song “Dead END” was pretty average at best for an opening. As for the second closing “Filament”. I found myself skipping it after seeing it after a few episodes. I didn’t like it that much. So...How does the soundtrack fare out. It sounded pretty average. I can’t think of one theme that is worth listening to outside the show except for the first opening.\
The Japanese casting is pretty average. Misuzu Togashi as Yuki may not be your cup of tea but it’s a fitting voice considering the character. Tomosa Murata is okay as Yuno but I don’t have much to add on that. I will give Future Diary some credit on the side of the Japanese casting for actually having a few seiyus that are not big names. However, there are some notable seiyus that did get to play a part here. Akira Ishida is fine as Akise and this anime also has Norio Wakamoto in it too, and he’s listenable here too like most roles he has had. I don’t have much to say about the Japanese Cast but I do have quite more to say about the English Dub of Future Diary. The adaptive script took major liberties with the original dialogue and I am totally okay with the adaptive script as is because not much of the context is lost in translation. As for the performances *sigh* I thougth Josh Grelle was the lowlight of the dub. This is because the original character intent of Yuki felt reduced. This is similar to his role as Armin in Attack on Titan except he played the part while the adaptive script of Attack on Titan kept most of the original character intent of Armin faithful. In regards to Future Diary, I did not care much for Josh Grelle’s performance as Yuki. Brina Palencia is not a bad voice actress but I think Tomosa Murata does Yuno better. Interestingly enough, Yuno was not tinkered around much in terms of the adaptive script . There are some noteworthy voice actors in the dub such as Kent Williams who is decent here and there’s Todd Haberkorn. I will admit that I think he’s the highlight of the dub but in all fairness. Like the Subbed Version, I do feel that the Dub is average as well. But because of the main leads in the dub, I do prefer the Subbed Version on this one but the dub really isn’t absolute shit, it’s just not one of Funimation’s strongest dubs since some casting choices were hit or miss, and Zach Bolton was responsible for ADR Direction here and it seems he has average dubs in his resume but Soul Eater is perhaps the best he has done with ADR Direction. Future Diary could have been fixed in a few areas if it could but it is what it is.\
The characters in Future Diary are an interesting case but first… I would like to address that I do not like Yuki. he’s a pussy. Sure, I understand the fear he goes through during this whole Survival Game, but he takes a while to get used to. Oh and as development goes, it’s not convincing. Yuno is… well...I don’t want to bring her up. The one decency in this show is that there are a variety of characters which most of them are the participants of the Survival Game. most of the participants has their own backstory, ideals, and goals and these characters did make the ride watchable. However, the characters are one of the things that makes Future Diary a bit predictable and this is after a few instances with the Diary Users. Then there’s Minene Uryuu. She is actually one character I had no major issues with. Oh, and Deus Ex Machina…Where do I begin with this guy? Oh, I don’t know… His full name doesn’t make sense!, I think a simple Deus would suffice. I do have a problem with the characters as a whole in this show but it’s not the majority of characters’ fault. Oh no, This brings up the major problem I have with Future Diary.\
I could not take the plot seriously and here’s why. The setup of the first episode was unplausible and when the plot goes full circle, it does not explain everything and there are some things that never get explained, leaving some plot holes that time and space cannot be altered to fix them. The Cell Phone “Diaries” are a bizarre plot device but assuming a god of time and space could make it possible, I suppose it makes sense, right? Oh who am I kidding. Some of the shit that this anime has makes no sense. Fortunately, this anime wasn’t too boring and to be honest. I actually enjoyed it to a degree despite the completely implausible plot. But there are some moments that really come in at the wrong time. From what I can tell you without spoiling anything is that when something bad happens. there was one time where an instance of that came along and the following episode starts off with something attempting to be funny. I am actually not joking about that. This kind of directing will induce slapping or at least thoughts of such a thing and Naoto Hosoda should have known better. Oh but the bigger problem is that this show has a “DEAD END”, since the show is implausible with no direction. I was not surprised that the ending wouldn’t redeem the show by any stretch of the imagination and it’s a clusterfuck.\
The Future Diary is available by Funimation. The Future Diary: Redial OVA was never licensed which means...no dub has been made for it. It is currently unlicensed which is a shame. The manga of the same name written by Sakae Esuno is available by Viz Media after Tokyopop went under.\
\
With everything said and done, The Future Diary was an amusing series with or without direction but it ends up being not as fun later on and it gets to a dead end. And  I don’t regret using that pun. It’s animation is a mixed bag, the soundtrack is average, the characters are what made this amusing at first but the story is a complete bloody mess.\
That being said, I give The Future Diary a 4 out of 10, it is NOT REALLY GOOD!\
Feel free to leave a comment.\

Critic’s Diary - Earthdate: February 14, 2015. Supplemental Review: Future Diary: Redial.\
\
The Future Diary: Redial OVA is actually made as an epilogue to the show which was left open. The animation looks somewhat improved, nothing’s different with the characters or the soundtrack. The plot to Future Diary: Redial is also implausible and I don’t care to explain it because I did not like the epilogue’s ending to it either and I’m glad i’m done with it.\

    This show is really pathetic! To say I was disappointed after watching the first 7 episodes will be an understatement. Was expecting a lot from this show considering it's rating and popularity but was quite disappointed in script.\
The script writer/mangaka insults the viewers intelligence when he thinks that whatever weird crap he writes people are going to follow and appreciate it. Really a 5 year kid obtains poison gas, antidotes, gas mask without the help of an adult,he has no problem taping the doors and window up to the ceiling and he is perfectly capable of shifting a tied and bound grown woman.

    What happens when you combine the creative premise of Death Note, the character depth of your typical ecchi harem anime, and the writing quality of a Tyler Perry movie?  The answer is Mirai Nikki.\
I recently rediscovered my love for anime a few months ago and in that time I have focused mostly on romances, but I have taken time to check things out that seem to have built strong followings and come highly recommended.  Over and over I continued to be pointed to Mirai Nikki.  I now know to not trust a few individuals on what to watch.  Although I have\
          \
        now seen several poor reviews of this mess of an Anime, I still have to say that for all of the hype, this might be the most overrated anime of recent memory.  However, what makes this most interesting is how good this anime COULD have been if it had been helmed by a more talented writer.\
Story- 6\
It’s hard to really review the story of this anime without spoilers, but I will try.  Surely you have read the premise of the story.  Sounds really interesting right?  Well it is.  The set pieces and conflicts set up by this really cool premise do not disappoint…mostly.  Here is the problem.  The plot relies on stupidity to maintain momentum.  This is more apparent in the beginning than toward the end, but on so many occasions I found myself asking WHY!  Why are you doing this, why are you with these people, why are you making this decision, etc.  There is a part in episode 9 where one character literally shouting “Why are you doing this” and “this makes no sense” but the writer didn’t seem to get that this is exactly what the audience would be thinking. The story too often asks for the viewer to ignore the ridiculous logic of the characters in order to allow for the various twists and turns of the story to have an impact.  The only redeeming factor is that because of the cool set pieces and conceits, the story is still engaging as long as you agree to play dumb for it.  Toward the end, the story escalates to ridiculous proportions, but I was not as offended as others.  This is anime were talking about, and aside from a few confusing twists, I must say that I found the ending a satisfying close to the problematic story. This is something that cannot be said about waaaaay to many animes.  Overall, the biggest problem with the story is that it fails to deliver on what could have been a really cool story.  It tries to crib Death Note, Evangelion, and High school of the dead and ends up just being a mess.\
Visuals/audio- 8\
In my other review I explain that I am not very qualified to really discuss the merits of the audio and visual quality of a manga.  I just like when it doesn’t look dated or boring.  I will say that I was impressed with the overall direction of the manga.  The way they framed many of the scenes definitely helped heighten the tension.  I found the constant use of the “yandere” face annoying after a while though.  Also, I really could care less about OPs and endings  but this is the first one I didn’t start skipping over once I got into the anime.\
Characters- 2\
This is where the anime has the most problems.  The characters in the story are completely devoid of logical human thought.  First you have Yuki our male lead who spends the first half of the anime doing his best Shinji Ikari impression.  Maybe it’s because im an American, but I will never EVER get Japan’s infatuation with these spineless whiny character archetypes.  If you took a shot every time you see him cower in fear in the first 10 episodes you will die from alcohol poisoning.  Then toward the end he suddenly turns into Lelouch Vi Britannia and starts working out these elaborate plans on how to eliminate his enemies, and suddenly and inexplicably falls in love with our other main character. The other major character is the now iconic Yuno.  While Yuno is definitely intriguing as a Yandere turned to 11, her behavior, inexplicable assassin skills, and understandably bipolar nature make her a chore to deal with.  She is too crazy to like and connect with or be a fan of, but too sympathetic at times to hate purely as a villain.  A more skilled writer could have made this conflict more engaging, but much like the aforementioned Tyler Perry, the author can only make her a moe fan service idol, or a psycho yandere killer and nothing in-between. The real problem is the “love” between these two nutjobs.  It just happens and It is never explained or built up to.  Although they save each other’s lives on many occasions, you never really get to understand WHY these two became drawn to each other.  Even at the end when the elaborate and silly backstory  connecting them is explained, you still don’t really get to see why this whiny wuss eventually falls for this bipolar sociopath that he has watched kill dozens people.  Aside from a few standouts, other characters serve little more than enemies of the week akin to a power ranger episode.  We have an L clone (who satisfies some of the deep rooted wants of a certain sect of Death Note fans), a Tsundere Gothic terrorist, a woman with a huge head, a three year old with a love for puppets, and a bunch of other psycho’s whose motivations are not explained but at least most of them were fun to watch.  Overall the issue here is that even though the literal fate of the world hangs in the balance, and the body count is quite high, you simply do not care what happens to anyone other than wanting to understand what is actually going on.  \
Overall- 6\
This anime is not really worth watching for the average fan, but it does have some interesting and intriguing moments.  Its biggest problem is its hype and the unfulfilled promise of its story setup.  If you can turn your brain off and just get engaged in a psychological thriller with tons of twist and a halfway decent payoff in the end, then go for it.  But if you need characters to have sensible motives, stories to stay grounded, and writing that doesn’t make you face palm, then you might want to pass.",

    Mirai Nikki, a psychological anime that brings up the theme of gore and killing. However, it is not an ordinary one as it also brought up the idea of unconditional love.\
To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this anime. I thought it would be another gantz or battle royalle (the japanese movie). I'm surprised at how the plot is smartly twisted and very emotional. Well, it's predictable that our hero, Amano Yukite will win the game, but the story and how it is told is very captivating. Therefore, this anime deserves a 9.\
Detailed Review\
Characters - 10\
This anime has successfully made me love a character\
          \
        in one episode and hate him/her in the next one, vice versa. Characters are developed, story of them (their background,etc) are being told clearly (exception for some). Well, that's understandable considering on the number of characters this anime had. It is executed brilliantly with some plot twist, flash backs, and many more surprise that this anime has to offer.\
Story - 9\
Who would expect that it would end that way? Every episodes ending always left me hanging and it always gave me the urge to watch the next one. One of the disappointment is that some things are not explained. I'm now still wondering how deus chose the player. I'm still wondering how each character got their numbering. I'm still wandering about how Yuno is already a G** however she is not in the se**** wor** (gosh these are some spoilers). Although most of it is magnificent and unexpected, there are still some loop holes and unexplained matters. Overall, it has a good and very creative plot. I love how they kept me hanging even at the last episode.\
Art - 8\
The lighting, colour composition and smoothness will definitely pamper your eye. Characters are occasionally drawn in a different state to show their personality. There are definitely some confidence in the art. Gore and blood are not drawn hesitantly. Beautiful background, however some of the drawing are a bit exaggerated, it turns out to be ugly.\
Sound - 8\
Not the best, but it is very suiting for the theme of the anime. They are simple, stunning and completely complement the story telling. It brings out suspense, mistery and sometimes emotions.\
Therefore, mirai nikki deserved the 9 because it has fabulous plot, lovable characters (and detestable ones too) and  colourful drawings. It is twisted, but definitely it is straight.\

    Future Diary starts off with an interesting premise: pick an assortment of people, give them the power to read the future, and tell them the last one alive will be granted the power of god. What would they do? What would you do?\
The characters cover a broad spectrum, giving many interesting viewpoints: a police detective, a terrorist, a shy high school boy, an insane girl, a cult leader, and seven others.  Everyone has a different reaction to their position. Some don’t want to fight, others are determined to win the power of god to make the world a better place, whereas others desire the\
          \
        power for selfish means. The animation is good enough not to be distracting, though there a few shortcuts here and there that stand out. The character designs are unique and interesting to look at, and the music supports the atmosphere it is intending to go for. Even the overall plot manages to run pretty smoothly, factoring in a plethora of twists and turns.\
Unfortunately, the series suffers from many character, mood and “minor detail” inconsistencies in addition to jumps in development I still don’t comprehend. One moment there may be a brutal slaughter, and the next there may be a moment that was almost slapstick. The main character is a grating, whiny, child whose logic I can only conclude stemmed from mind-boggling cowardice. I was sorely disappointed every time some murderous intent missed him by a hair.\
Other characters likewise had responses, reactions, and made decisions that felt more a victim of lazy and contrived writing than anything else. In the same lifting of believability, many of the wounds  inflicted and brushed off as insignificant would have made Bleach gape. Add a suspiciously recurring rape theme that felt more like an overfondness than for character development, and light treatment of middle-schoolers partaking in sexual intercourse, and Future Diary pulls the rug from under its own feet.\
The end result is a series that is too immature to handle its subject matter in the way it desires. Sure, it tries to point out the depravity of a survival game, but the mood swings ruin any attempt to be taken seriously. In fact, Future Diary may have fared a bit better if it had gone for a black comedy in its moments of humor than for light-hearted silliness. It tries, and although there are moments of genuine emotional depth, and does have a fairly solid ending, in the end it is merely another story that falls short of any lasting impact.\
Feedback on what is helpful, not helpful, or how this can be improved is appreciated.\

    Oh, Mirai Nikki, Where to start,\
The premise was quite good to start the series off, although nothing too amazing , it was quite out of the ordinary and wasn't tied to any other anime, so kudous for that, But as the story unfolds, and oh my, does it. You begin to get a good idea of why this anime was so popular in japan and Spain. \
The art, at first glance, is nothing too awe inducing, however, when the fight scenes come out, And they do, about 5 times every episode, But moving on , The Effects of the blood, is great, it fits my\
          \
        ideal art style perfectly, although others may not enjoy it, and I'll respect that. \
The sound. I'm not even going to comment, except for this : \"WOOOOW\"\
Go look up : Mirai Nikki, Here with you. \
Tear inducing without even having any visual aid.\
\
But . Here we are, The Characters, Ah, the Characters. yes, some Argue, : Well the Protagonist is a little bitch?. Why yes. Yes he is. If you exclude all his badass moments, People forget that every protagonist doesn't have to be OP Jesus-Kun Kirito. \
But the TWO standout characters. And some say its only one are:\
Yuno Gasai: I would tell you why. but there's no point. if you don't like Yuno, dont bother with this anime. Shes a Psycho \"Girlfriend\" who basically invented the word : Yandere. She makes higarashi look like a slice of life.\
Akise Aru:  Akise. is Batman, that is all, no really though, take Sherlock Holmes, batman, And lelouche vi britannia , Mix them, with the charisma of Captain jack Sparrow. and you have yourself Aru akise.\
Hes the most brilliant Bi-Sexual A.I in the world, and, he'll leave you wanting to watch the next episode so fast you'll forget to eat.\
This anime, is Deffinitely worth a watch if you enjoyed anime such As sword art online, Code geass, or guilty crown.\

    Warning: minor spoilers\
There are certain standards and requirements that make a good show or movie. Well-written story, good character development, steady pacing, the works. The problem with Mirai Nikki is that it fails miserably at even the most basic rules of storytelling.\
The story itself is sloppily written at best. The concept itself is actually quite great and the whole idea of being thrown into a survival game that uses future predicting cell phones where the winner becomes god of time and space is brilliant and it definitely adds interest to the show. However it’s the concept’s execution that causes the story to fall apart. \
Mirai\
          \
        Nikki constantly presents itself in a way to make you expect certain things and then go in the complete opposite direction. The main weapon that all the contestants use are obviously their diaries all of which are able to predict the future and each have their own special abilities that make them unique and as the diary owners take actions, the future written in the diaries will change. With a concept such as this you would assume that means that the characters will have to use their diaries to outsmart their opponents and will show a lot of intelligence, cunning, and elaborate planning. But nope! Most of the characters are idiots and instead Mirai Nikki focuses not enough on the diaries and too much on action, fight scenes which are mostly bland and boring, and back stories for characters we don't care about. Many diary owners are defeated the same way. Yuno brutally hacks her way through all their minions before finally reaching the diary owner and slaughtering them in cold blood or destroying their diary. Mirai Nikki also has a bad habit of throwing in bad jokes in serious moments and there are MASS amounts of mood killers in this show that make Mirai Nikki seriously unworthy of the title \"psychological thriller\" the story moves slowly, the plot forces itself along constantly, and the overall show is ridiculously repetitive.\
The show also tries way too hard to get you hooked as nearly every episode will leave off with a major cliffhanger, which would be fine except the next episode almost never picks up where it left off and will usually take several episodes to get any answers. The questions all lead up to huge plot twists that yes are definitely surprising. I did not see them coming. But surprising does not necessarily mean good. Most of the plot twists create more questions than they answer. Most of which will also take forever to answer or will just not get explained at all and there are a mountain of things in Mirai Nikki that simply don’t make sense. It gets even worse towards the end of the show when they start hitting you with plot holes big enough to fly a jumbo jet through. Plus all the completely random crap they start making up on the spot towards the end to the point where there is no longer anything in the show that makes any sense anymore.\
Warning: The next paragraph contains spoilers.\
I don't normally like to include spoilers in my reviews but I feel like I just have to talk about this. When you get right down to it, Mirai Nikki is a love story and if you want to see the worst, cheesiest, most forced love story ever that makes soap operas look like masterpieces then look no further. Yukiteru has a million reasons to hate Yuno, he spends most of the show lying about loving her, and then at the end he decides to fall in love with her for real with no logical or believable reason other than “just because”. This is immediately after she made him kill all his friends by the way. Not to mention that there is absolutely NO chemistry between the two of them at all. And even if she did save his life a few times, it does not justify the horrible way she treated him throughout the series and is still not a good reason to fall in love with a psychopathic serial killer that could do who knows what to you. *cough cough* She tries to kill him. *cough cough* \
Still a better love story than Twilight? Nope. Not this time.\
Spoilers over.\
The characters overall are horrible. Many of them will often take actions simply because the plot demands it and as far as intelligence goes, the characters are flat out stupid. You know. The kind of stupid that’s painful to watch and makes you want to go smash your head against the wall. Keep in mind that this is supposed to be a psychological thriller.\
Amano Yukiteru himself is without a doubt the WORST protagonist I have ever seen. Period! Seriously, how do you screw up the main character this badly? Why is he bad you ask? Because he’s a terribly written character who fails to fulfill his role as the protagonist and is simply unlikeable. Starting at the beginning of the show, Yukiteru is portrayed as weak, pathetic, spineless, cowardly, annoying, and helpless (hell he’s even voiced by a girl) But that’s alright because that’s what character development is all about! And we know he’ll get stronger and braver as the show progresses right? WRONG! Yukiteru spends the entire show doing pretty much nothing but hiding behind Yuno while she does all the dirty work and by the end of the show, Yukiteru is the exact same person he was in the first episode and has not changed at all. The protagonist is supposed to be the hero of the story. The relatable character we root for. Yet Yukiteru doesn't care at all about winning the survival game and does so little that his character could probably be removed entirely and the show would still work. Even when he does start to care about winning towards the end, it's for the most illogical reason imaginable. His character is incredibly inconsistent, he puts way too much trust in all the wrong people and is too quick to forgive thus he ends up consistently making things worse for himself, and as with most characters in this show, he is an idiot.\
Now for the other main lead. The yandere poster girl. Yuno is your typical yandere who obsesses over Yuki and threatens to kill anyone who gets near him and she does this part of her role quite well. Murata Tomosa also does a fairly good acting job and her voice fits Yuno pretty well. On the flip side, like everything else in this show, her great potential is ruined. There are many traits that drag down the seriousness of her character. She often acts goofy. Many times even in serious situations and her dialogue is pretty pathetic (not a good trait of a psychotic character) and consists way too much of her constantly crying out “Yukki!” She is also seriously lacking in any decent personality besides yandere.\
Regarding the other diary owners, they are obviously supposed to be the antagonist of the show and as such are portrayed as crazy psychopaths. Many of them also get their own tragic back story that I’m guessing is supposed to make us feel sympathetic towards them though it does not excuse the horrible acts they commit and ultimately just creates confusion. Are we supposed to like these guys or not? Of course it doesn’t matter whether or not you like them because most of them won’t be around long enough for us to care much anyway. One of Mirai Nikki's major faults is that it spends way too much time and effort in giving us detailed back stories on minor characters that are only around for a few episodes while the back stories of our main characters that actually matter are barely touched on.\
As for all the other characters, they are mostly bland, forgettable, and as I mentioned before… IDIOTS! Though I will say that I kind of liked the character Akise Aru (and when I say \"like\" I mean \"hated the least\") Akise seemed to be the only character that possessed intelligence, which makes him a good fit for a psychological thriller like this, though his character is still far from perfect.\
As for the art style, it’s fairly good though nothing special. The soundtrack is also pretty average overall but the tracks do their job of fitting the scenes and neither of the openings are bad. Mainly the first intro, which is definitely amazing.\
So is there anything good in Mirai Nikki? Well... actually yes. As a matter of fact Mirai Nikki is overflowing with amazing potential to be a great show. The problem is that every ounce of that potential was wasted and shat upon in some way or another. And that's exactly why I consider this to be the worst show I've ever seen. I would rather watch a show that is bad from the get go (e.g. Pupa) than have to sit through the torture of watching such great potential be thrown into the trash heap. And believe me, I REALLY tried to enjoy this show. What’s upsetting is that there are so many underrated shows out there with fantastic characters and stories that clearly were well thought out and had a lot of effort put into them. Of course none of that matters anymore because nowadays you can just slap yandere on a character, throw in a bunch of hack and slash action and apparently that works. And it’s very disappointing that that's the type of show that gets popular nowadays.\
So is Mirai Nikki worth it? Well if you’re one of those very casual viewers who likes to pull the good ol' \"turn off your brain\" trick and watch shows based on pure enjoyment alone and doesn’t care about flaws then by all means feel free to watch this show. Don’t think about it at all and you might like Mirai Nikki. On the other hand if you're any kind of critic with standards then you will probably want to avoid this show as you will most likely see it as the big jumbled mess that it is.\

    Story: The first couple Episodes didn't really grab me all that well. I mean the concept is cool and they really did a good job turning it into something a child would want as a super power and it was awesome finding out what all the future diaries did as the story progressed with the different diaries doing different things based on the type of person that held them. The story was excellent towards the middle and end and the OVA episodes filled the void I would usually have at the end of an anime like this, but the beginning is slow and didnt grab\
          \
        me. Hell i dropped it for 5 months and only picked it up again because i was bored and wasn't watching anything else. BUT Holy Fucking shit not even M. Night Shyamalan can come up with twists like this.\
Art: The only part that grabbed me was the realm of the god of space and time(Deus Ex Machina). With its purple tints and clock gears it was befitting for Deus Ex Machina speaking of which thats the other thing that grabbed me for the most part he was animated with CGI and really stood out from the backgrounds and characters. Other than that nothing stood out.\
Sound: There really isn't much I liked about the music the only thing I LOVED was the first opening the animation and the music to go along with it was 10/10 \
Characters: Lets be honest here no one heard of this anime because of Yuki His copy paste character doesnt leave much for you to get attached too. You came here for Yuno Motherfucking Gasai with her devoted love for her sweet prince, Yuki, she'll do anything from decking people in the face to straight up cutting their heads off. \
          But something i enjoy from anything i watch, read, or play, is the lore or backstory of the characters and this anime does an excellent job of going through each of the diary holders backstories. Sometimes they make you feel for them, sometimes you can relate to them, and other times you wish they didn't have to die. \
Enjoyment: Although i dropped it for 5 months  in the end I really enjoyed it.",

    I started on Mirai Nikki, with some skepticism, after my friend badgered me into watching it. Mirai Nikki was an interesting experience for me. I never liked horror and gore, and yanderes. However, this piece drew me in, at some points making me cringe in disgust, rant about the (warped) logic, yet, it brings out the love in the horror filled world, and that held on to me, letting me last through to the end. The concept of playing with time also intrigued me.\
Story: The story follows the protagonist, Yukiteru, as he is tossed around in a world where the future can be predicted, and\
          \
        where other people with their own agendas change his future and toys with life. The story doesn't turn out to be anything spectacular, with the manipulation of time being nothing more than a tool for scheming individuals to achieve their own ends. The idea that giving humans power to play with time is brought out interestingly.\
The main thrust of the story follows the schemes of Yukiteru's girlfriend, Gasai Yuno. Yuno is ultra possessive, and clinically insane. Yukiteru, being the typical main character type, cares for everybody, and this creates conflicting interests between Yukiteru and Yuno. Possessive love rarely works out.\
Art: The art matches the story decently, reflecting the mood of the story. It effectively signals developments in the story. Mirai Nikki relies, to a large extent, on text, as that is the medium that the future diaries are in. The English reading of the text in the diaries, as well as other parts of the show is well integrated alongside the scenes.\
Music: The soundtracks are excellent, and very fitting of the scenes. Deserving of a full 10 out of 10.\
Characters: I personally feel repulsed by mentally incapacitated characters, as seems to be the case for most yanderes, and some protagonists, Yukiteru being one of them. Most dramas however feel the need to bring in characters who make the stupidest decisions, so as to bring the story forward. Guilty crown comes to mind. Sometimes it fits, sometimes it just doesn't work.\
Yukiteru is shown, rightly, to be a worthless sack of shit, incapable of making friends, cowardly, incompetent, indecisive, and desperately wanting to protect everything without risking anything. In other words, a selfish cowardly brat. Halfway through, the loss of his loved ones pushes him into finding some determination to fight on, and hits the other extreme, going mad and ruthless. Even then, he rarely shows brilliant moments. Seems a little typical. Once in a while, he stands up to Yuno, and fights for his ideals. While I don't like him, he fits as the main character for an apocalyptic world, survival battle royale setting.\
Yuno is a great Yandere. Driven completely by her obsession with Yukiteru, she is ruthless, insane, and is an effective killing machine. Her pains and internal conflicts are brought out well, and her sick love is brought out through the incessant call of \"Yukkii\". Despite that, her vulnerability invites feelings of protectiveness, and Yukiteru being the man he is falls hopelessly into her venus fly trap. Yuno strikes me as one of the best characters ever, but I still don't like her.\
Other supporting characters flesh out the story well, everyone possessing their quirks, and motivations. For the most part, the supporting cast isn't introduced abruptly, and killed off just as sudden as they come in. \
Enjoyment: The pace of this anime is one of the best I've ever experienced. This is one of the key criteria I consider for  enjoyment. I got absorbed into the show so much, so that sometimes, I feel a strong urge to rush through the scenes, while at other times I feel a peace and calm settling in.\
Overall: I would recommend this anime even for those who are opposed to the themes and character types as I am. Don't let personal prejudices stop you from appreciating uncomfortable themes. The delivery of the anime more than makes up for it.\

    Mirai Nikki’s mission statement is one of its more obscure characters. Yomotsu barely has 20 minutes of screen time. He seems at first like an out-of-place oddball with his posturing as a Hero of Justice. This posturing is crucial. He says that the way to know who’s just ad who’s evil is according to who wins.\
It’s a blunt way of saying it, but it’s true of many stories. Our hero defeats the villain with brute force, and we know he’s right because he didn’t deliver a speech about World Domination. In Death Game scenarios, it’s even worse. In Hunger Games, Katniss never has to come\
          \
        to terms with killing innocent people.\
The Death Game scenarios are scary because they force people to fight who’d otherwise won’t. Katniss never has to face her fellow players’ humanity. She just happened to face the cruel ones. No such shortcuts are taken in Mirai Nikki.\
Everyone is funny in their head, but no one is outright evil. Some are more crueler than others, but that cruelty is explained. We’re invited to understand these characters. Even when the cruelest of them die, there is tragic vibe to it. Things could have been different for them. Reisuke and Tsubaki are characters who made wrong decisions based on their circumstances.\
Even John Bacchus, the character who could most easily become a caricature isn’t. He has grand plans for humanity, but not cheap World Domination. We see his plan’s failure in action, rather than have a boring speech about megalomaniac aspirations.\
This approach to the Death Game brilliant. Not only it gets why the scenario is interesting in the first place, but it makes it more thrilling. Some have criticized the show for having a cast of stupid and psychotic characters, but that’s the point.\
The best thrillers aren’t just a bunch of intelligent people playing mind games. Playing games is more fun than watching others do it, anyway. The best thrillers are those that are concerned with the emotional consequences of the scenario. They create thrilling set-pieces. They use atmosphere, symbolism and visual style instead of constant feedback.\
Mirai Nikki is closer to thrillers like Pi and The Machinist, rather than the constant build-up of Death Note. It has a cast of weirdos who are thrown into a scenario with other weirdos and try to navigate it. The thrill comeד not from wondering What Will Happen Next, because it’s interesting to see these personalities clash.\
There are not highly-skilled badasses. Since they’re all emotional wrecks, that makes them unpredictible. We can expect an intelligent person to come up with a solution, but we’ll never know when a regular person will act on his rationality or on an emotional impulse. Whereas many thrillers just give the characters random skills, Mirai Nikki literally gives skills to the characters based on who they are. A loner is given a diary which records all his future observations. A couple is given diaries which predict their lovers’ future. An owner of an orphan home is given the ability to produce diary owners, like giving births.\
If this starts to sound meta, then it only gets worse. Aren’t Yukki and Mur Mur a paralell to the us, the viewers? Yukki was, until the game starts an observer who wrote what he saw but didn’t participate in things. That’s how consuming media often works, especially when you write reviews like these. Mur Mur’s motivations seem like she might be evil for evil’s sake, but her desire for amusement is familiar. Don’t we watch these Death Games stories to be amused, too?\
While the Death Game scenario is the main theme the series questions for a while, there are a bunch of other ideas scattered around. Romance is being satirized with Yuno. Her character is more clever than people give her credit for. She’s a response to people’s desire for someone to love them deeply. Yuno’s love is serious, but it’s also selfish. She’s concerned more with protecting Yukki than what Yukki wants, although she matures a bit as it goes on.\
There’s also some things about the nature of God. If Deus’ death seems like a giant plot hole to you, then you’re unfamiliar with mythology. Gods die and humans replace them all the time, and Gods are often limited in their power. We also get a Badass Switch, which addresses the topic at hand. Yukki doesn’t simply become a gun-packing OG. He’s suppressing his sensitive self, but still acts on his desire to help others. We even got a Metaphysical Rebellion thing going on. The owners are all given the ability to change the future, yet do they really change it? Yomotasu appears again. He’s being told he will die, so he just kills himself.\
Some of them try to rebel, to do something other than become Gods. Mostly, they all go along with the circumstances they’ve been given. That’s the reason why many of them became crazy in the same place. It’s not an accidental detail. The whole Final Battle is one big metaphysical rebellion. It sees the characters trying to create an alternative future.\
All of this sounds very clever on paper, but the execution is closer to the violent use of that word.\
The problem with Mirai Nikki is that it’s too original and has too much to say. It’s full of ideas and it wants to deal with them on its own rules. We get a few pretty women, all of which spend more time being characters rather than let us stare. There’s an extended sequence where Yuno is in underwear but it never slows down to give us good-looking shots. There are shifts in tone that feel appropriate. Such an overblown story can’t work without some humor. The progress of the story is more thematic than realistic. Things exist and happen because they fit the tone and meaning. Questions like ‘how did Rei get the poison?’ are left unanswered because they’ll most likely not add much.\
The problem with creating your own rules is that you’re a first-timer in the game. Digimon Tamers might be brilliant, but it’s the result of past failures. The story is archetypical. The creators looked back on similar stories, saw where the holes were and filled them.\
Mirai Nikki has no such tradition to draw from. It borrows freely from School, Death Game, Psychological Thriller, Action and Fantasy. It’s both excited by what it has, and unsure of itself. That’s why the pace is too fast, but the series never runs out of stream even when it’s off the rails.\
Normally I’d complain about a few unnecessary episodes, but this one needed more. The characters all have quirks that point to a personality, but that’s all they do. Their defining features are too often external – a tragic event in their past, an ill son. We don’t get enough of moments that show us how these things affect them.\
They are affecting them enough to feel different. Both Rei and Tsubaki have their tragic pasts, but one is full of hatred and the other is just cruel. That’s a pretty significant distinction. It’s not explored, though. These characters die too quickly.\
What made the Cult of the Sixth so exciting is because it threw all these weirdos together. Instead of having boring one-on-one match, we have different people doing their things according to how they see fit. You can’t do it for 26 episodes if everyone is constantly dying. They kept some of them alive for a long while, so why not all the rest?\
There is also an added mechanic which might feel like an asspull. It actually fits the theme of the series and is necessary for the metaphysical rebellion thing. The problem is, by the time it appears our story shifted focus. We’re no longer following a cast of weirdos and their plight, but see the metaphysical rebellion itself.\
It’s interesting enough, but it calls for a different series. A story ends when its ideas conclude, not when stuff stops happening. In this case the survival game ended, therefore the first story is over. Shifting a focus just causes unnecessary confusion. If they dedicate 26 episodes to their ensemble and expanded the final battle to a short second season, it’d be better.\
At least the the series never runs out of steam. From the beginning the show feels like it will go off the rails, and it does. The train keeps going forward though. The track might be lost, but you won’t reach your destination by standing still. Even when it loses itself it refuses to play by anyone’s rules but its own.\
There’s something admirable how it keeps going forward. Better anime than it fall to convenience when things get too hard, but Mirai Nikki just speeds forward. If we compare anime to Icarus, then Sword Art Online gives up on the sun and drowns. Mirai Nikki forgets about the sun and tries to fly to outer space, but burns in the atmosphere.\
Credit must be given to the visual style. Mirai Nikki features some of the best character design in anime. No one is spared. Many anime have talented designers, but only the women get this treatment. Just look at Date A Live, which has brilliant designs like those of Yoshino and Tokisaki, but Shido might as well be a stick-man.\
Here, we have an attention to detail. Yukki isn’t just another black-haired hero but given an actual style, even if it’s less flamboyant than others. Everyone has their own facial expressions, their own hairstyles and their own outfits. It speaks volumes about the series when it creates pretty women but doesn’t linger on their bodies, and finds room for a deformed one too. There’s something beautiful in the picture of the ending theme. We see all the owners’ shilouttes standing, each with his own unique shape.\
This makes everything feel so alive. It may look unrealistic. Marco’s hair definitely can’t stand like this, but that’s not the point. Animation is expressing ideas using visuals. Human beings are often weird. I lived with many of them, and few turned out to be normal. Their personalities are closer to Mirai Nikki‘s flamboyant design rather than Mushishi‘s, where everyone looked the same. Now what is more realistic?\
Mirai Nikki is full of flaws and little holes. There are       average anime with less obvious problems. There are also not many with so much life and energy, that play by their own rules rather than someone else’s. There is a masterpiece here somewhere, but the pacing is too rushed and there are too many ideas than it can carry. It’s never boring, it’s rarely convenient and it’s always unhinged and bizarre. In this case, I’m willing to forgive the flaws.\
The biggest plot hole that nobody talks about is Uryuu Minene never wearing her twintails again. These are the best twintails in the history of anime. Why not use them?\

    Stating that Mirai Nikki is a bad anime series would be a severe understatement,its enough to look at the existing reviews to notice  that the reception it received is mostly negative.\
But not only is Mirai Nikki a terrible series, but its the kind of bad that makes you morbidly curious at how much worse it can get .And by the end of it actually delivers in that regard,but that's now saying much of course. A turd is still a turd no matter how you look at it.\
Before going into to many details and without spoiling to much about it ,i would like to give\
          \
        some examples of situations that happen and as to what you should expect from this series, so if you haven't watched Mirai Nikki  and don't want to get spoiled in any way shape or form please skip this next paragraph:\
**Minor Spoilers\
A 5 year old toddler getting violently killed for no real reason that could have easily been retrained or at worst slapped a bit,a female character who gets kidnapped and tortured also for no real reason after which she is immediately and casually released by the same person like nothing ever happened,a character writing a phone text message and getting beheaded at the same time (with a kitchen knife no less!!!!)\
\
Notice a pattern here? Yes unnecessary violence for the sole purpose of pure shock value that adds nothing to the actual plot of the series ,exactly like in a low budged horror movie.Whats funny is that without these stupid moments the series would have ended up completely forgettable ,so at the very least it has that going for it. \
\
So lets get to the story shall we.\
Like most anime series nowadays the story starts out immediately from the very first episode, you are literally thrown into this world and into its plot with no proper introductions or any kind of foundation to it.\
All in the idea of suckering in the viewer and leaving him/her curios as to where its going and adding crucial details and flashbacks along the way whenever it feels like doing so.\
The basic premise is a survival battle royal following a young high school boy  (of course) named Yukiteru and his classmate Yuno ,the other main character, in their efforts to combat the other participating members with their help of their future diary phones which can predict the near future.The winner of this death game will be successor to the God of space and time.Sounds simple and straight forward enough right ? How can it go so wrong then? \
Well for starters the whole battle royal premise if misunderstood by the author from the very begging since all opposing opponents all politely take their respective turns to \"battle it out\" with the 2 main characters and almost never go against each-other.There are just 2 exceptions to this,where they do fight but it also directly involves Yuki and Yuno so it might as well not even matter.\
Secondly the writing is just god awful,completely amateurish (he-he) as if written by someone just starting out in their early teens.\
Flimsy plot - check,completely inconsistent characters with sometimes multiple change of motivation in the same episode - check,overly stretched story that takes to much time to go anywhere - check,plot elements that go nowhere or are completely forgotten -check, lackluster ending that cops out of whatever has happened and developed so far -check.\
Mirai Nikki has it all that's for sure.\
\
The absolute worst part of this anime however lies with its characters.\
Yukiteru is just a atrociously bad and useless main protagonist ,he even makes the infamous Ikari Shinji from Neo Genes Evangelion look good in comparison. Spineless,childish ,gullible to the point of mental retardation,but of course very kind to his friends with no other defining characteristics .He is absolute joke of a character and downright cringe-worthy to have to watch.Even die hard otakus with no self-esteem would be like \"ugh even i'm better than that loser\". \
Whats worse is the series tries to make a sudden 180 turn in character for him in the very last episodes ,but by that time it just comes out of nowhere and in no way well presented or acceptable story wise.\
The second main character and the entire reason this anime got any sort of attention (the ridiculous fandom she has received over the years is just mind boggling), Yuno is a straight up psychopath.Lets not miss words here with all the yandere crap and so on .She is a psychopathic character which would have been good and maybe great if the writing wasn't so damn bad.\
The motivation for her behavior is just laughable and a complete disgrace for people who actually suffer from this mental instability.Plus the anime never bothers to explain as to why she is so strong and has such keen reflexes and senses,the writer probably believed that if someone is a psychopath than he automatically is a super villain.\
And lastly her constant shouting \"Yuki-Yuki\" will drive you absolutely insane by the time the anime finishes. \
The secondary characters are extremely lacking and completely forgettable,they vary from nonexistent just to take some screen time to boring with no strong or defining characteristics to just all out laughably comically crazy.Notable mentioning goes to Minene Uryuu who is completely inconsistent and changes her character and motivation like a hundred times throughout the series. \
\
Animation is the only thing this anime has going for it,but that's not saying much for a series released in 2011.Character design and backgrounds for the most part are good but somewhat inconsistent ,some character looks much better than others and there is some very weird use for CGI for simple things such as bicycles or mobile phones.\
Sound is also ok,the VA for Yuno actually does a pretty good job at representing the soft and angry side of her character (minus the whole repeating Yuki-Yuki a billion times over and over) ,other VA do their job decent as well with no other stand out performances.\
\
Overall when its all said and done the series just falls flat on its ass in multiple ways,the primary being the story and character which are the main factors for making or breaking a anime series.You can have all the highest production values you can possibly get,but with a terrible story and weak characters it wont get you very far.\
What Mirai Nikki achieves is making the viewer either disappointed if they somehow still had any sort of expectations by the end of it or angry because they wasted so much time on such a sloppy series.\
26 episodes is still a large number of episodes all things considered,you could easily spend your time with so many other series that don't have the nerve to mock the viewer the way Mirai Nikki does.\

    This is my first review. Read the anime description first as I will not include details written in there.\
First off, this is quite possibly my favorite anime of all time, but I will not be biased, though my overall score is biased. If I were to rate this anime in an unbiased manner, I would probably give it an 8 or 9. The rest of this review will explain why.\
Opening/ Ending themes - 10. \
Some of the best out there. They fit the mood really well and play a role in enhancing the experience of watching. I feel that the opening and ending themes of\
          \
        an anime can magnify your attraction to it if they are good enough and the themes in this anime are.\
Rest of the soundtrack - 8. \
Nothing really stood out for me except for the \"sad\" song (which made some incredibly emotional moments). The soundtrack certainly doesn't hurt and it can be quite complementary to it, but it is nothing mind blowing.\
Story - 9. \
I find the basic plot quite intriguing. To put it simply, the relationships between diary holders are quite fragile. If there is cooperation, it is doomed to end in betrayal at some point down the road. This creates a sense of tension, though it is not made nearly as strong as it could have been made (similar to the tension in death note, but very minor). This combined with some \"interesting\" characters makes for a story that is unpredictable and contains plot twists that you just don't see coming.\
Episode Progression - 7. \
This category represents the flow of the anime by episode. To put it bluntly, it is quite rough. Some episodes are crazy and full of goodies and other episodes leave you feeling unsatisfied as virtually nothing has happened.\
Art - 8.\
To be fair, I don't pay much attention to the art. I like some of the color schemes used and a lot of the character expressions, but I wouldn't say that the art stands out or is original/ innovative.\
Characters - 9.\
I could just say Gasai Yuno and leave it at that, but I will add a bit more. I found that there was a good variety between the characters and aside from Yuki, I didn't particularly dislike any of them. No two characters are the same and you get a sense of individuality with each of them. Not all of the characters have depth, but a good number gain some through flashbacks. The anime does a good job at using the characters to create anticipation for future episodes (mainly Yuno, but Akise is a very mysterious minor character).\
Character connection - 10.\
There are a lot of flashbacks in this anime. It can be frustrating when you want the main plot to continue, but it really improves the experience as a whole. Most of the flashbacks give you a peek at the past of the diary holders and you find out their motives for becoming god, giving you an idea about the type of people they are. These flashbacks make it easy to be emotionally invested in some of the diary holders and can make some of the scenes heartbreaking. I can assure you that there will be at least one scene where you will want to cry.\
Character development - 9.\
Aside from a few characters, they don't really change. There are a few fascinating relationships that characters have though and watching them develop is a treat. I will just throw this out here: a lot of people hate Yuki and I understand, but I wouldn't give up on the anime just because of how annoying Yuki is. He is a main character and that makes him a prime candidate for character development.\
Enjoyment - 10.\
Ignoring some of the frustrating aspects of this anime, I have found it very rewarding. This is because I am incredibly drawn to the nature of this story. The image of Yuno at the end of the first episode made me fall in love and Yuno is like the Naruto/ Ichigo of this series, but with a vastly superior character. Those who are hooked on the premise will love it and those who aren't are at risk of getting disinterested during a few strings of bland episodes.\
Overall - 10.\
If you are not immersed in this anime, you will not give it a 10 because it has obvious flaws. However, I think there is quite a bit of appeal and a lot of people will fall in love with it like I have. The anticipation of the development of Yuno and Yuki's relationship keeps the viewer wanting more. Really, what makes this show so amazing is that you know that Yuno or Yuki will have to die for this game to end and as fewer diary holders remain, the suspense of how the game will end keeps building up.\
tl;dr\
Don't judge this based on your first impressions of Yuki and try to watch at least half the show before writing it off. I get the impression that the end is going to be mind blowing, making the 2nd half superior to the first half.\

    I find myself having to rewrite my review after not getting the right impression about this series. It took me a while but I finally got my hands on the original manga for this show, and after understanding what the author really wanted to do, I find myself puzzled at how weirdly it's portrayed here.\
First off, and probably most importantly, Mirai Nikki is a psychological horror manga. The anime, on the other hand, is very action-oriented, with such an emphasis on the action that it takes away completely from the atmosphere. This is one mistake the anime made. The manga allows you to get a\
          \
        much better understanding of the adrenaline rush you get from the main characters, and what makes them so interesting is your ability to relate more to their problems - their human aspects are ultimately lost in the show. This immediately takes the story down a few notches, a hindrance it absolutely cannot afford, especially when it's already sort of a jumbled mess, and especially when the pacing is totally off. \
The art style is very generic. At first I thought it was incredibly well done, but after reading the manga, I can't help but feel that I've seen it somewhere before. It almost seems like a carbon copy, and that's never good. Anime was designed with breathing new life in mind, and if it can't do that, it fails at being a faithful adaptation. The sound work is even worse; aside from the opening theme, it almost seems like the entire time, it's trying to confuse you. Some of the soundtrack and character voice work do build up suspense, but it turns out to be somewhat of a cheap scare as a result. They're not too keen on the uptake, either; you can instantly tell exactly what character is supposed to be doing what by their voice acting, and it all seems kinda stereotypical and bland. That said, what this anime does excel at is what its manga excelled at as well; it's a very charismatic and clever combination of things. I didn't really fall in love with the individual aspects, but I absolutely loved how it all came together. This allowed me to enjoy it probably a bit more than I thought.\
Overall, it's not a terrible anime; if you're an absolute critic, you can tear it to shreds and absolutely hate it, but if you're looking for entertainment, this may or may not deliver what you're looking for. I'm still going to keep watching it myself.\

          \
        own unique way both with advantages and disadvantages. During the Diary Game he meets a seemingly friendly girl named Yuno Gasai, who, in reality, is secretly obsessed with Yukiteru to the point where her personality resembles that of a yandere character (yandere is the term for someone who is shown to be naturally kind and friendly to someone they really care about to the point where their romantic attraction becomes increasingly destructive and they will use any means, usually violent, to ensure that they stay with their romantic interest forever). As Yuno and Yukiteru progress through the Diary Game, they meet the other contestants that either intend to kill them or attempt to join forces with them as allies. Through these interactions, Yukiteru begins to questions the motives of those around him, and uncovers the truth about who Yuno Gasai truly is. By the end of the series, Yukiteru becomes a very changed person who is far from who he was at the beginning. The ending has a big twist which I won't spoil here, but it was a twist that I definitely did not see coming. \
STORY 10/10\
The story of Mirai Nikki at its base level is one between Yuno and Yukiteru and their twisted love story. It was very interesting to see how the two characters interact. The Diary Game storyline also shines, but is sort of secondary to the main characters' relationship. The twists and turns the story brings are truly award-worthy, with the ending being the ultimate bringing the ultimate twist that no one saw coming.\
CHARACTERS 10/10\
The chemistry between the two main characters is great, despite the two of them having very different personalities to begin with. Yukiteru starts off as a very kind, shy person who does his best to avoid killing people, but also lacks the ability to protect himself properly, whereas Yuno will do anything to protect him, even murder others. Her Yandere tenancies is what bring the whole show together in my own opinion. Her psychotic personality and the identity of who she truly is was a defining moment in the story. The character evolution of the two is intense, and by the end of it you'll see Yukiteru end up as a completely different person. \
Other characters in the series have great progression as well. Some of the Diary owners are actually genuinely caring people, like Keigo, a police Captain who helps Yuki and Yuno and forms an alliance with them. Minene Uryu is also a character with great depth and my second favourite character of the show. She is also a Diary owner who starts off as an antagonist to the main characters, but eventually ends up as a protagonist by the end of the series. \
All of the characters have an interesting story to tell, and as you watch each episode, you'll begin to wonder and look forward to finding out more about each Diary owner, and the ability of their Future Diary. \
MUSIC 8/10\
The first OP was probably my favourite of them all, by I didn't really enjoy any of the EDs, but that's just my personal opinion! \
OVERALL 9/10\
Overall, Mirai Nikki is a great suspense/thriller with plenty of action and no boring bits, leaving you at the edge of your seat after every episode. I was so hooked that I wanted to binge watch the entire series in one go. The ending had me wanting more, because I felt that there wasn't any closure for the main character, however, the OVA rectified that. \
If you enjoy action, drama, and suspenseful thrillers involving time travel with fantastic character development and storyline, you'll enjoy Mirai Nikki hands down. It's a show you'll end up loving or hating, depending on what kind of anime you enjoy, but to me, it would definitely be worth a watch. \

    If you like blood, violence, survival of the fittest, a psychological mind freak,  and a psychotic main female character, this is the anime for you. I, personally, really liked this anime for the unique and beautiful story. I couldn't stop watching my screen to find out what happened next! \
While I didn't care much for the character designs, I still really enjoyed the story this anime told. I recommend this anime to anyone who likes these types of anime simply because it puts you on a whole new ride and it's simply beautiful. \

    Although i have only seen one episode i can be certain this series will be a great one. Its kind of like Eden of the east, people with cellphones that end up in a survival game with the winner being the last person holding this future telling cell phone the winner or new god.\
These cellphones tell each of the 12 peoples who are chosen their own future. It is a diary written specifically for them. \
The story for me is a cross of Eden of the East and Steins Gate (but futuristic not past)\
Over all great story even if it is similar to some animes,\
          \
        it is also completely different so far. \
I can presume they will explain each of the twelve characters over the series. \
Overall, great voice actors, love the music, the art is beautiful for the characters, kind of reminds me of Noein art wise especially for the \"God\".\
I really hope this story continues to be epic, as this series is  must watch!\

    Mirai Nikki..one of those anime shows which starts off in the right track,then completely gets out of point...and finally attempts to partially redeem itself...resulting in a \"DEAD END\".\
Initially having high hopes for the series,i felt quite satisfied in the first few episodes...however since then it went downhill,resulting in an absolute trainwreck.\
Story- simple enough..the god of space time (Deus Ex Machina),gathers our protagonist Yukiteru,his obsessively stalking girlfriend aka psycho Yuno Gasai and 10 others to engage in a battle of death,each having their specific future diaries.The last one standing gets to be the next God.Thus began yukiteru and yuno's attempts to kill the other contestants and\
          \
        making yukiteru the new God of space time.\
Characters- i almost hated all the characters,except Akise and Minene...\
Yukiteru was a crybaby all the time,probably the most whiny character i've seen after obviously Shinji Ikari . Gasai yuno,whose insanity topped the charts..was enjoyable at the start but then was so annoying at the end of the series.All the other characters practically got no development.\
Art- mediocare,not really mindblowing.\
Sound- the op and ed were good.especially liked the \"happy ending\" theme.\
Overall,mirai nikki showed a lot of promise...but the middle part was really pathetic.Even though i liked the ending,i expected a lot more.\
So if u are a fan of the horror/gore genre..watching Higurashi or elfen lied is a better prospect than Mirai nikki.\

    ****** SPOILER FREE REVIEW******\
If someone tells you that he/she doesn't use a phone, you probably entitle that person to be an alien. I think smartphone has become a detachable body part(mainly the memory) of any average human being.\
Imagine you have set a reminder \"To wake up Jack at 5\", but when the alarm rings at 5 and it displays \"Don't worry! Jack is dead!”, you will shit bricks. The basic concept of the anime is that only. The story revolves around Yukiteru Amano, a teen introvert, writes all the event that he observes nearby, seconds in and seconds out, in his phone's virtual diary. Has\
          \
        not much friends except the god of time and space himself, who is also a part of his imagination.\
Animation quality is very good, available in 1080p (Violent and Ecchi Content Included). For avoiding spoilers, DO NOT, i repeat, do not watch the opening or the ending song till you finish the anime completely. The background scores, OSTs and soundtracks compels you to think more and more about the plot further. Character development is the best thing that you will experience in the whole series(specially a hot overly attached girlfriend). Each and every character has its own importance and uniqueness. You won’t find a single character useless (even for a very less time). Now, the best part, climax, thrill and suspense, which ..... I won't tell you. Go watch it yourself and get your mind blown. Final Verdict, if you love anime like, Death Note, Steins Gate, Monster, etc., do watch it. \

    [Adapted From Blog Post]\
Can I say something crazy? I absolutely adore the genre \"battle royal\" whether it be the movie \"Battle Royal\", the book \"The Hunger Games\", or that one video with the \"Sesame Street\" characters. I always find myself drawn to to this kind of story, that is the kind where an X number of participants are put in a remote location and are told to kill each other until one is left standing; I think they make up for thrilling stories. So you can imagine, when I find a story of this nature in anime, it pretty much goes straight onto my 'Plan\
          \
        to Watch' list, for better or for worse. While Fate/Zero was an absolutely amazing delight, and Danganrompa...less so, where does Mirai Nikki fall in the spectrum, hit or miss? Let's say it hit the ball out of the park...and into the river. \
The story begins with our main protagonist: Yuki Amano, a shy high-school kid who has a quite distinct lack of anything resembling friends. He's not bothered by this however, and instead spends his time constantly updating a diary kept on his phone, a diary that pretty much chronicles every single little thing Yuki does over the day, hour by hour. When he isn't updating his slightly creepy hobby, he talks with his imaginary friend: Deus ex Machina, the lord of time and space. Having a strangely vivid imagination, Yuki divides his time between having curiously detailed conversations with 'Deus', and building an entire timeline of his life on his phone.\
      One day however, Yuki learns that his imaginary friend Deus, is not quite a fictional as he lead himself to think. It turns out Deus is actually god, but a god with a problem, he's dying, and the time to choose a successor has come, and turns out Yuki is lucky enough to be considered for the position. Not so luckily however, Deus also informs him that the only way to succeed him as god is take part in a specially crafted death-game where himself and 11 others will battle to death for the right to become the new king of time and space. In addition, each participant in the game has been given a \"Future Diary\" a device that will tell the future; Yuki's cellphone becoming his own diary, detailing everyone happening around him...a minute or two before it actually does. Armed his this information Yuki returns to his school, waiting his moment to track down the other \"dairy users\", he soon finds out the the death battle fully intends to bring the party to him when a masked man with a knife attempts to saw his head off. He is eventually saved by a classmate named Yuno Gasai, who turns out to another dairy user in the death-match, and also completely insane. She claims to be completely in love with Yuki(even though he can only remember talking to her once), and helps fend off the attacker. Yuki, reckoning he can use her considerably more skilled knowledge of fighting to stay alive, so he plays along with her love story, though as he uncovers secrets of her past, turning and running the hell away from her seems to become the more viable option. Together the two, will need to have to outwit the other psycho-paths Deus has chosen for this game, and discover the real reason behind this death-game.\
Now let's be honest here, this is a pretty awesome set-up, and leaves room for a lot of cool ideas what with the time prediction aspect of the death-game. The first few episodes of Mirai Nikki I actually found quite intriguing and I also really liked the dark tone and gritty violence it was going for, which is something I think is often underused in anime.  Not only could I expect some cool action and entertainingly crazy characters, but the whole mystery behind why Yuno is so infatuated with Yuki was also fairly interesting.  Unfortunately, it's the manner Mirai Nikki goes to answer its questions that leads to its downfall, as well as a few other pressing problems that need to be addressed. The series has a bad habit of trying to outdo itself far too often. It'll throw plot-twists at you as the series progresses with increasingly regularity. Here's the problem with that: if you try to continually provide mind-blowing twists that change \"everything\" you only end up pushing your plot and characters to the limit, you'll end up contradicting yourself, and relying far too often on convenience.  If you want to enjoy the show, you'll need to ignore the increasingly flawed plot, as problems start pouring in as episodes continue. Of course though, the show leaves the biggest \"twist\" for the very end, which completely destroys any continuity the series had left, and is so ridiculous that its hard not to roll your eyes. \
     Also, Mirai Nikki is not one to be subtle with how dark its trying to be. It'll completely lay down horrific information with absolutely no build-up or purpose, just because its trying to shock the viewer. By the end, Mirai Nikki has brought rape, entire families being killed both on and off-screen, and murderous little children to the table, really for no reason at all, and is exasperatingly dramatic for the most part. Yeah, that dude will definitely abandon his child to die, because \"this is a dark show guys.\" Not to say the horror aspect never works, because personally Yuno has a couple scenes that freakin' terrify me, but its not enough to make up for the rest of the melodramatic crap. ...Onto the characters. \

Our main character Yuki really isn't much too talk about. He starts out the series as a complete wimp, and while his gradual growth of confidence is nice, it's handled sloppily at best. The animators never really seemed to care too much about his character, and this leads to a massive personality change for him in the last third of the series, which reasoning for is extremely crude and hard to see how he got from point A to point freakin' point H so quickly. To be fair though, he's probably the most down-to-earth character here. He really gives off the impression that he's in a fight he never asked for, and especially considering how much his life starts to crumble apart during the anime, its hard not to at least respect him for how well he takes everything. Unfortunately his character is often brushed aside because the animators apparently thought we need to again see how awesome and crazy Yuno is again. Why do you think I needed to settle on a Yuno thumbnail for his review? Since the animators didn't care enough about his character to make him good, Yuno pictures were my one and only option. The hell? He's supposed to be the main character!\
  And now for the only character in this entire show that we're supposed to care about: the queen of stalking herself, Yuno Gasai. For the first half of the show, the character development she's given literally begins with she loves Yuki and ends with she's insaaaaaane. Thankfully she's given enough back-story to make her a decent character by the end, even if her reasoning for doing the things she does seems a little sketchy, though to be fair she is crazy, so I guess that's an excuse. I just can't help but feel that Yuno is just the perfect \"yandere\" that we're supposed to worship, and draws complete character attention so that everyone else in the show becomes super 1-dimensional. It's same problem shows like Sword Art Online and Gosick had, just concentrating on one character simply means that you didn't care enough about your world as a whole to make it fleshed out and interesting, which you know, sucks, and means I won't have to much to say on this next character. \
     Akise Aru is an enigmatic want-to-be detective who regards attending school with quite a bit of contempt, and prefers to spend his time solving cases. He appears later on in the show and becomes an ally of Yuki during the death-game. Besides from this though, he doesn't have a lot more to him, besides from acting mysterious and totally not like Kaworu from Evangelion. The only other personality trait he acquires would be traversing into spoiler territory, but even that is completely out of left field with its reveal, and only really serves to aid Mirai Nikki's worrying habit of digging its own grave. While he has a cool reveal at first, he quickly falls into the category of characters I would list as \"meh\".\
     The students that make up the high-school characters are fairly one-sided and boring, and the other participants of the death-game are killed practically as soon as they're introduced, but there's one more additional character I would like to touch upon briefly. Ninth is a part-time ally of Yuki and part-time terrorist participant of the death-game. She's generally likable and has some awesome moments, and ell, the anime was even kind enough to give her a decent back-story before switching instantly back to Yuno smashing someone's head open. \
Finally something positive to talk about. The soundtrack for Mirai Nikki was composed by Katsuhiko Takayama and it actually contains some bad-ass tunes, from two exceptional openings and that track above this paragraphs. It's full of those high energy action songs that really get you ready for what's to come, though if I had to add, certain tunes can be overused due to the low amount of actual music on the OST. \
     The animation was handled by Asread, and don't feel too sorry if you haven't hear them. They've only ever been credited with making 7 anime series as well as a couple OVA's, so understandably, the animation is fairly average. Oh, it's not bad, but there's never any time the animation is superb or standout moments, though they do tend to make the series's many fight scenes engaging and exciting. The character designs are a bit of a mixed bag, with some designs looking semi-realistic, but others quite literally resemble the Pillsbury dough boy. I'm not even joking. All in all though, most of them are distinctive, which is really all you can ask for, and once you see these characters again after watching the show, you should recognize them instantly. \
So, in conclusion I'm not going to say Mirai Nikki is a good anime, or that it's even worth your time. Its great premise get completely ruined by the over-the-top plot twists and bland characters. It handles its mature themes in an immature fashion, and pretty much falls apart plot-wise by the end of it. Though if you're in the mood for a good ol' bloodbath to turn your brain off to, I'm going to not stop you.This series can be fun at times, even decent, but that quite long list of problems I mentioned above will stunt that pretty quick. Also if you don't like Yuno's character you're basically screwed enjoyment wise. Yeah. She's crazy.... and stuff.\
Final Verdict: 5/10\
P.S: You'd think Deus would have saved a lot of time by just picking slips of paper out of a hat.\

    I never knew about Mirai Nikki (or Future Diary if you want the english title) before my friend mentioned and I am glad he did. I am loving each episode as it passes by.\
Story - *Slight spoilers for Story and Character*\
Mirai Nikki starts off about a socially awkward boy named Yukiteru Amano who uses his phone to make diary entries on the world around him, the people he notices etc. Being socially awkward, Yukiteru made friends in his mind. One being Mur Mur and the other being Deus Ex Machina (the God of Time and Space). During a conversation between Deus Ex Machina and Yukiteru,\
          \
        Deus makes Yukiteru's phone have future diary entries. So for example, when he finishes reading the future diary entry on his phone, the first thing it says is \"April 22, 6:59 [My Room] I hit a double bullseye at my morning dart throw. At first Yukiteru thinks he wrote all of this during his sleep, then later thinks it is all a coincidence. He is able to use his phone to know when their is an upcoming maths test and his phone has the answers to it. Anyway, to sum up the premises up for the rest of the series, Deus pits 12 random diary holders (just like Yukiteru) to play a game, where they have to kill each other. The last one standing's prize is being the successor to Deus Ex Machina of the God of Time and Space.\
Art - Bright colours, for a dark anime.\
Sound -  I like the sound of Mirai Nikki, this anime knows when to play the right type of music, being it suspensful or a happy tune.\
Character - The character Yukiteru himself, is like I said before socially awkward. But he is pitted against other diary holders trying to kill each other and also him in the inclusion of that. So he has to make actions, he wouldn't normally do or say before any of this actually happened. \
Another character I have yet to mention, is what I believe is the main factor, the bread and butter, without this character, the show wouldn't be what it is. Her name is Gasai Yuno. Gasai Yuno is also a diary holder, but she is different from the rest. She doesn't want to kill Yukiteru, she wants to protect him at all costs. Sure that might seem all harmless and all, but she has this particular trait about her, that differentiates her from the other diary owners and side characters. She can go from sweet and cute to one crazy SOB (not like in some ecchi/rom-com animes) when it comes to protecting Yukiteru. \
Enjoyment - I really love this series, pretty much all the episodes leave you on a cliffhanger and it really does grab your attention. I am not sure, you'll get what I mean from just reading my review, but I am loving this series. Can't wait for more episodes.\
Overall - Even though, it is only up to episode 9, there are still 17 more episodes to go.  The character development and relationship between Yukiteru and Gasai Yuno does have you asking \"Why would she go so far to protect Yukiteru\"? It is a really gripping anime, and does take you for a suspenseful joy ride. If you enjoyed the likes of Death Note (only with the odd funny/awkward scene every now and then) then you'll without a shadow of a doubt, love Mirai Nikki. As soon as it gets released in DVD format, I will be picking it up. A perfect 10 from me. \

    A MONTH BEFORE THE GAME STARTED-\
I was handed a Diary by a tiny girl named Mur Mur. The 'Reviewer's Diary'. In this survival game, I'm the 13th Diary holder. I think I have the \"weakest\" diary out of all the other diary holders. \
This \"Diary\" of mine automatically writes out my thoughts and comments while watching the anime, Mirai Nikki.\
Diary Entry #1 (1/5/13) 11:24 AM\
========================\
Based on the Sypnosis, Mirai Nikki is a psychological thriller, based on the manga written and illustrated by Sakae Esuno, is about Yuki, a loner who's not very good with people. He prefers to write a diary on his cell phone\
          \
        and talk to his imaginary friend, Deus Ex Machina – The God of Time and Space. However, Yuki soon learns that Deus is more than a figment of his imagination when he makes Yuki participate in a battle royale with \"TWELVE\" others. The contestants are given special diaries that can predict the future, each diary possessing unique features that give it both advantages and disadvantages. Within the next 90 days, the contestants must try to survive until there is only one left standing. The winner will become the new God of Time and Space.\
Diary Entry #2 (1/7/13) 3:52 PM\
=======================\
Mirai Nikki premise is pretty unique, I'll have to admit. \
The first episode was good. \
It got me hooked almost instantly.\
After the first few episodes, Mirai Nikki starts becoming stale.\
Mirai Nikki's graphics are pretty nice though; nice backgrounds, decent visuals\
Diary Entry #3 (1/9/13) 4:21 AM\
========================\
GOOD LORD, Gasai Yuno. I thought she was one nice, sweetheart at first, but then turns out she's one crazy, Yukiteru-stalking, psychopath. She's only 14 years old, but to me she looks like a 16-17 year old. Whats with her over-developed body?\
And, Amano Yukiteru, why are you such a coward? You can't have a girl like Yuno protecting your butt everytime you're attacked by another Diary Holder. Geez. Probably the first protagonist I don't like in an anime.\
Episodes are getting progressively becoming dull too.\
\"Blood Teller\" by Faylan is a really nice song to listen to! INSTA-favourite ED of the week or month.\
Diary Entry #4 (1/10/13) 2:23 AM\
=======================\
I'm starting to feel awfully bored in the middle of series.\
Series is starting to introduce more Diary Holders; but most of them are annoying as hell. Though, it was fun watching them fight, while I was hiding in the background.\
Diary Entry #5 (1/11/13) 9:37 AM\
=======================\
Managed to complete (barely) the anime!\
The ending was absolute meh.\
What's with the Dragonball-like fight in the few episodes, couldn't stop laughing at that part.\
Hmmm...I'm getting this feeling that someone stalking me...\

    This review should not be read before completing the anime since it contains a lot of spoilers.\
The setting of this anime is very well described in the very first episode. Twelve contestants have been selected to participate in a survival game where the winner becomes the next god. The main element introduced is the usage of diaries that can predict the future. The idea is incredible and it drives the anime really well. Diaries being put on mobile phones works very well in a way that it allows them to easily blend into modern society. Future being accessible, but varied with the interference of other\
          \
        players, gives conflict between the users a lot of potential. The life-link between the user and the diary adds some thrill as well. \
In the several opening episodes, future diaries were utilized well during conflict, especially for combat. In the early stages of this anime combat feels very rushed. Going into the middle of the series, future diaries don't appear as a crucial component to winning the fight itself which completely bashes the logic behind this anime. Strategic diary usage is suddenly replaced with Yuno's crazy instincts and reaction times which yes - can be completely justified after watching the whole series, but make cruising through the anime a lot less enjoyable.\
Characters which you might deem important are being killed within seconds. A chunk of contestants are eliminated very fast which makes them feel more like pawns than characters. One would think all the emphasis would be focused around the competition, when side characters end up being more important for the series than most of the contestants themselves. From a perspective of a viewer that does not yet know the whole story behind Yuno, some actions and decisions were completely unexplanatory. Foreshadowing of her character has only been very slight and the truth being more gradual would surely make this series more enjoyable. On the other hand, her being a complete lunatic obsessed with Yukki actually works surprisingly well in the end. The way she took Yukki for granted right from the beginning illustrates that quite well. She carried the whole show since Yukki was too busy being a complete coward. \
Now Yukki's character progression has been pretty much non-existent. His motivation for friends has been justified by not having any during his school days, when all he truly needed was protection. You'd expect his confidence and independence would rise throughout the series. They only appear as occasional spikes and happen in the presence of others, which makes him a character completely unable of being independent. The source of protection he was receiving never truly mattered. The choice between friends and Yuno has always been the one which appeared safer. In a situation where Yuno locked him in, he trusts his friends more, and later he ends up killing them himself. Main character being completely unable of becoming more confident makes going through the series quite unenjoyable but it somehow feels crucial at the very end. Also, the fact that Yukki wasn't utilizing his observant nature felt very disheartening, i.e Yuno noticing there were no starches on fake phones.\
The 4th was shaping up into a what seemed to be a really impactful character. I felt like the police would have been a significant factor since the character would represent the police, he was a diary holder that had an army on his fingertips. It was really sad to see this character go completely insane and get eliminated, after which the police completely loses any function in the series despite all the chaos and murders happening. Minene Uryuu, the 9th, was a really great character. She changed significantly after getting her eye stabbed tough. Her past is explained quite well and she goes from being a crazy terrorist to realizing the game and situation she's put in. She was the only character that stayed true to her spirit and motivation. Her progress is very natural and she takes a role of a really stable well-rounded character.\
The frames are really well-drawn and they show a lot of detail while the the animation did not have the chance to shine apart from the last few episodes. There isn't much memorable music played apart from the emotional piano theme and the violin battle theme which are definitely quite significant. More often it felt like music was used as a filler to the sounds. A lot of sounds that lean towards horror have been used in this psychological thriller, which matched the quick bursts of movement nicely.\
Humor in this anime series was handled pretty well. It holds a few memorable humour scenes most notably the one where Nishijima is very direct about his relationship goals with Uryuu. Anime humor does not appeal to me most of the times, but there were a couple of scenes that were pretty funny. I thought the addition of murmur in a from of a sketch at the end of the episode was amazing since it works as an optional addition. You can focus on anime when shit gets serious if you don't like the moment being spoiled by humor, which you can easily get back to later. Additionally, closing scenes with murmur provide some minor explanation of all the characters making your understand them just a tiny bit better.\
All in all, it's a series that will blow you mind away and make you rethink everything that happened throughout the series, but I feel like there wasn't enough effort put into making episodes more enjoyable. A lot of optional conflicts have been very shallow and the tense parts ended way too early. The story line midst series can be summed up as Yuno being psychotic over and over again. Most of the emphasis was put into the grand final, making the story lack some progressive development.\

    Ever wish you had the ability to see into the future? even if it's only for 10 minutes or however long? I sure did, which made me interested in this anime.\
Now, I'll say I really did enjoy this anime, as it falls under my favourite genres, but let's not get into that and we shall hit the ratings now, shall we?\
(My second review, bare with me ;_;)\
Story: 9\
The story of Mirai Nikki is basically a survival game, you're given a diary that possesses a specific ability, maybe to see someones future? or to see what happens around you? The story is seen through the eyes\
          \
        of Yuki, a lonely kid that finds interest in writing what he sees around him in his diary. He believed to have two imaginary friends, Deus Ex Machina(the god of space and time) and Mur Mur, his servant. He was given a future diary, to see into the future, along with 11 other people, one of which including a friend from school Yuno(my favourite character of all time) who protects him because Yuki is a complete wimp.\
Now, I'll say for one, that this idea for the anime is really unique, that it was paced well, and had very strong points in terms of psychological breakdown and other things along those lines. I found episode 1 to be a bit slow, but then afterwards it just went from there, hits you with full force.\
The ending was a bit half-assed though, I'll say that now, which is one of the reasons why this aspect did not get a PERFECT RATING, however the story made it very much enjoyable and I enjoyed every part of it.\
Art: 10\
The art style of Mirai reminds me of that of Deadman Wonderland, very clean and simple, the eyes and structure and animation overall was done nicely. I didn't see very many mishaps on this end, the characters looked unique aswell, some of them a bit generic, but oh well, you really can't stop that. Landscapes and atmospheres gave off the moods of the anime right away, which was very nice.\
I had no problems with the art, and I really did enjoy it as well.\
Sound 10: Whether it came from the killing of the characters, the voice actors sick laughter and the overall unsettling soundtracks, nobody will know. I loved the opening and ending soundtracks, and recently each characters themes, especially Kasugano Tsubaki - Cries of Avici. The sound effects were very well done as stated, no problems at all, I was impressed and even today, I still listen to the openings, endings, and character themes.\
Character: 9\
The characters of Mirai Nikki are all very unique, they come from all backgrounds which most of them get explained later on in the anime. The character development was very nicely done, as I said at the start, psychological breakdowns and slowly starting to break down. They did what they did and regretted and felt guilt, it wasn't like some animes where they just have a blank emotion, can't say the same for Yuno. \
I enjoyed all the characters, none of them were a bit of a clique, so that was nice, each of them just wants to become god to create a better life, so it's not like they're evil, but in the end, only one will survive lol.\
Enjoyment: 10\
I very much enjoyed this anime, whether it came from the very gripping plot twisters, or the very conceptual music compositions, I enjoyed it all. I'm very glad I was able to watch this, and in my opinion it's a must watch for a fan of the genre.\
Butthurt critics, they can all go and leave, they will give this anime a low score, but rate mainstream animes 10/10, don't ask me why, biased.\
Overall: 9.5\
I wanted to give this a 10, but some aspects could've done some refining and some work, overall though, I did enjoy it, and I recommend all of you to watch it.\
Don't take my word for it, just give an anime a shot, try to disregard reviews.\
I hope you enjoyed me review.\

    Let me tell you all a little tale about a girl who wanted to save the boy she loved from a game of kill or be killed. 12 go in but only one comes out alive. Sound familiar? Yup, because it has been done before. Behold, Mirai Nikki also known as The Future Diary, The Hunger Games of the anime world. \
Now now, I know that is isn't the same as The Hunger Games since a) it came out before The Hunger Games, b) it isn't set in a apocalyptic world with a dome and crazy people with weird hair, and c) if you win\
          \
        the game you become God and not a infamous person everyone hates. Plus, only one can win. Not two. So let us begin this review with a question, hm?\
Why?\
Story: 5/10\
Easily becoming a overused plotline, this anime is twisted together with different themes, styles, and many many plot holes. I became confused fast on what was going on because well...there was no building of the plot. They literally just threw us into the cage with the lion saying \"good luck!\" and away we went with an up and down and up and down plot structure. I got sick fast with the roller coaster movement. Now, why cell phones? I get it, it's the 21st century, but did they really have to use cell phones to create a message of \"this can be you if you continue to stare at your cell phone instead of going outside and doing whatever\"? It's different, but the message of them using it wasn't necessary at the slightest. Plus adding the twist of \"guess what, your cell phone was selected out of a million others to go into a killing battle to the death,\" kind of made me jump back and feel sorry for the characters. The romance part was a little overdone. It was strange the see a woman protecting her man though, its usually the other way around. So that was a nice change for once. But the emotion being used in contrast to everything else didn't fit. And this will be explained in the \"art\".\
Art: 5/10\
Another example of a style of art I wasn't particularly fond of. Different colour hair, eyes, school girl uniforms, the typical anime art. Like who designed these characters? To fit the story I felt like they could've gone a darker direction with the design of the characters and background. They seemed to bright of a shade. I get they were trying to mix things up and confuse us with a plot twist, but those plot twist still should match what is happening. Still, for a bright coloured anime, they did use the blood and gore well. I was happy to see this anime live up to the rating's reputation. \
Sound: 6/10\
\"Is it wrong, to love popcorn and tea. Tea. Biscuits, biscuits, fuck this tea.....Steak Fries.\" This is the first thing I hear every time I watch the first OP. *slow clap* great choice in song. Great choice. Yeah...no. The beginning song used a psychotic beat to get us 'hyped' for the episode. Yes, they did well to established this. They used perfect amounts of darkness in the animation and song to lead up to...yeah, nothing what I was expected. Why doesn't these openings match with the episodes! They probably should've put in a less darker opening so they wouldn't lead us into something disappointing. \
The voice acting wasn't all too bad. Even the english dubbed was pretty alright. They did match the character's personality well, even Yuno's VA was very well done. I am impressed! \
Character: 3/10\
Yuno...the Queen of the Yandere. I think this character inspired the Yandere video game simulator. Either way this girl has serious mental issues. You can tell from the beginning this girl is messed and at first glance you'll think \"oh she has multiple personality disorder\" but...does she really? She's a big mystery and an overachiever at that. I would feel sorry for the guy who has to date her. Talk about getting no sleep at all. \
\
Which brings us to contestant number one: Yukiteru Amano! Also known as the guy who got thrown into a cage with a lion thanks to his 'imaginary friends'. More like having schizophrenia. This guy is living on the boarders of reality and imaginary. But still I feel sorry for him being thrown into a battle he probably never wanted to become a part of. \
Minene Uryuu: the only character I actually liked in this entire show. You want to know who's the bad ass in this show, it's her. She's probably the only one who shows that yes, this show is gory and dark and will become a living hell. She's not afraid of anything. She's not afraid of death. She's not afraid of killing. She's not afraid of nothing...except loosing. Yes...I think she's the only sane person in the entire anime. \
Enjoyment/Overall: 3/10\
Decent anime, but yeah...up to you if you want to watch it or not. This was a strange anime for me. But am I going to stop you...probably not. I got bored from this anime...but it was a short one so I just fought my way through it I guess. Everyone has their own opinion on it though. Heck, this is one of my best friend's favourites, and here I am giving it a low ranking. Sorry, but this anime was just...not enough and too much at the same time. \
This is a Dead End for this anime. I give it a 47% on the kill scale. \

    Pro-tip for watching this anime: Don't try to piece together anything cause you'll be wrong unless your imaginative skills are over 9000!\
Story: 8/10\
I think that this anime had a really strong story. Basically the story is that there are 12 people chosen to possess a \"future diary\" which is a diary that is kept on their phones. Using these diaries, the 12 contestants are able to read about the future and what will happen. However, every diary is different as each of them have different things they show. For example one may show if someone is lying and whether they will betray you later while\
          \
        another may show you the best way to win a fight (neither of these two examples are in the anime so no spoilers!). As you can imagine, it can be quite crazy at times and you can't really predict what will happen as the diary holders can obviously alter the future to their liking (if possible). Although because of the craziness, there are plot holes that arise but can easily be looked over due to the fast paced action going one.\
Now while I did enjoy that aspect of the anime, I didn't find the romance part of the anime too appealing. Usually when you have two people that like each other, more good than bad comes out of it, but in this case more bad than good came out of it and that led to many of our heros dying. Usually because they were trying to save our [pathetic] protagonist that couldn't do jack ****.\
Art: 8/10\
Nothing too bad. The colors were a little dull sometimes, but yeah nothing that'll kill you.\
Sound: 10/10\
Yeah everything sounded very nice. I mean everything from the gunshots to explosions sounded fine. Even the sound of someone's eye coming out was *gags* great.\
Character: 7/10\
OH MY GOSH this had to be the worst part about this anime. Yukki, the protagonist, had to be the most annoying character you could ever think up. You know how in mostly everything it's the girl who's the \"damsel in distress\"? Well guess what? This time it's a dude. And the person saving him is... yep a girl. And not just any girl, but a yandere styled girl (a person that is overly obsessed with someone else, usually going to great lengths to care for them). Now you may think this is an ok match up, I mean the roles are just switched what's wrong with the girl being the hero? Well did I mention that she's a psychopath on top of being a yandere? Basically when our main character is in danger, Yuno (the psychopath), will run to save him killing everyone in her path without hesitation (because she's a psychopath so it makes perfect sense). And while that's going on, Yukki is crying. Like I swear, every single episode has at least one scene where Yukii is crying and let me just say that this anime has a timeline of a few months. I'm sorry if I'm ranting, but it's quite awful.\
Overall: 9/10\
Well the show was certainly one of a kind. I kept trying to piece things together, but I always ended up at the same result: nothing. I think that was great as it left a sense of mystery for each episode especially the later ones. If I could change one thing it has, has, HAS to be the main character. He was so bad as the protagonist that even when he was trying to be good he inadvertently killed someone else. But even so, this is a show that will get you hooked and begging for more.\

    If I were a complete novice to anime and someone introduced me to this show, I would be appalled and mark anime off as nothing more than a gore infested whore house of the art industry, because the show comes equipped with more than a few classic anime cliche's that, when kept apart, are rather appealing, but when thrust together, are a shameful mess on the industry. Mirai Nikki holds serious parallels to Sword Art Online for me: both shows have a wicked concept they are based on, but both are destroyed by pacing and modern anime conventions. In the case of Mirai Nikki, the\
          \
        shounen-y 'villian of the week' feel, disturbing rather than pleasant fan service moments, and a total lack of any character development or compelling theming really drown out the positive aspects of the show. But while someone could watch SAO for their first anime and at the very least come away with the idea of anime as having the ability to be both artistically beautiful and imaginative, walking away from Mirai Nikki would at best leave confusion as to if the Japanese were mentally sane. To those who say Mirai Nikki would never be someones first anime, the insane hype for this show would like to say otherwise. Sure, its not many an otaku's first lover, but coming from personal experience, Mirai Nikki was indeed just about my second. And while it does not reach One Piece level stardom, the cult following this show has attained exists as its sole proprietor, like harpies singing beautiful praises from there corpse infested caverns to those unaware of the term yandere and its implications. \
Not at all to say that in any way do I dislike gore, ecchi, severed limbs, the psychological genre, sociopathic protagonists, games of death, or even yandere (or any such dere for that matter). Individually I actually not only can tolerate them but enjoy about everything I just listed. So what could be my issue with Future Diary, an anime chockfull of all of these things and more? It single handedly created its own species of dere for darn's sake! But that is where the line is drawn; you either love Future Diary to death, or like me, you recognize it as a disjointed mess. Herein lies my issue with Future Diary. Somehow, someway, it has become a series that is held up as one of the best things we have to offer to the rest of the world when it comes to animation. Because while the following of SAO has at least come to realize the series is majorly flawed (speaking solely for its first season), judging by the very diverse reviews it receives on this very website, Future Diary still manages to hold a number of 8s, 9s, and 10s within its review section, consistently. And while I'm not saying people can't enjoy whatever they want to enjoy, I'm startled by the amount of people who feel so strongly about this show. Because in my opinion, it's shameful garbage, and here's why:\
Strike 1: The synopsis sounds bad-ass, right? Twelve people with diaries on their cell phones that can see into the future use them in order to fight to the death to become the next god. This show sounds immediately up my alley, psychological genre to boot. But a more accurate genre for this is far and away shounen, as instead of moving the focus between characters, chronicling everyone's individual attempts and motivations for becoming god, or any sort of intelligent set-ups and traps made with the use of the Future Diaries, we are instead subject to a whiny, useless protagonist that has nothing going for him besides that fact that, for no reason at all, everyone is going after him. And when I say everyone, I very much mean everyone just stands in a line to wait to get a whack at the first Diary user. Episodes are made up of instances where they introduce a character, said character attempts to kill Yuki, and Yuno does all the dirty work in the process of saving him before the episode is over, without said character having any effect on the entire rest of the cast. \
The Future Diaries tend to only be used in a very immediate fashion, ie characters only whip them out when they are about to die, with only one or two actually using their Diaries before they are in a life or death situation, and I can tell you Yuki and Yuno are not those people (unless Yuno is literally attempting to stalk Yuki). Instead the diaries tend to serve much more as plot progression than devices that could potentially change fate, and even their properties and abilities manage to simply fluctuate with whatever issue has arisen for the characters in trouble, keeping a very consistent level of dues ex machina always present that, more than anything, only manages to detract any sense of real threat from the show. I failed to ever worry about the characters of Yuki or Yuno, not only because I already failed to have an emotional connection to them, but also because I never truly wondered about the outcome of the death game. Yuki holds such a very strong main-character immunity that even as weak and whiny as he was, I never worried about him. Yuno would save him, or Akise would save him, or Eye-patch would save him, or someone would kill themselves so he'd live, or the entire rules of the game would shift just in order to give a reason for Yuki to be saved. So Future Diary is not about the Future Diaries, or the entire death game, and wondering who would become god. Future Diary is really just about the characters, and boy-  \
Strike 2: You can read a different review if you want to hear about how much a frustratingly weak character Yuki is, but I'm in full agreement that he is the least compelling of any character on the show, and while he does at one point grow out of his baby phase, it comes in the form of such a complete 180 in character that it's even worse than before, because he becomes equally as psycho as Yuno.\
After about episode 5 you begin to realize a few things. One being that the characters of this show choose to make about the worst, most illogical decisions possible. For example: How come literally everyone immediately goes after Yuki after he lives just one time? Literally no battle is shown that is between someone that does not involve Yuki in some form or fashion. Two: How come, whenever anyone else gets a DEAD END, they just sort of give up, when right from the very beginning it is shown that you can evade any such end? I'm talking specifically about instances like the eye ball guy, who I honestly believed to be a compelling character up to the point ***minor spoilers*** of his killing himself, at which point began the very rapid downhill slide for the show. *spoiler end* Three: How come no one actually reads their Future Diary!? I'm serious that there were at least three different instances where someone would look at their Future Diary, read whatever the last text was, and respond immediately to that, without even checking whatever the rest of the thing said, which many times had already recorded their failure. I watched the show dubbed, so I don't know how it went down subbed, but the text messages were handily translated in English for us as well, and so many times were there in which Yuki woud freak out over something written without pausing for a moment to read the rest of his diary that confirmed how useless whatever he was about to do was. Whether this is a production glitch or something done on purpose is irrelevant; it only manages to make them look like total morons.\
The second is that these characters do not serve as emotional platforms for us to become invested in, but are really simply back-story infused canon-fodder for Yuno to chop to pieces. If you wanted to see something that included multiple characters with ridiculously sad back stories, go watch Angel Beats! or something along those lines, because here, the writers just decided to think of the most messed up as possible scenarios for their characters while not at all addressing what their motives are for the Future Diary in the first place, besides ruling the world. Nearly no character says what they would do if they did come in possession of the Future Diary, and even the ones who do say nothing more involved than world domination. Many characters are straight-up jokes, or stupid stereotypes, like the four year old child, or the oddly rotund day-care worker. What good would come to them for becoming the Master of the Universe? Of course it's a cool concept, but its not like anyone is rooting for them or anything. \
Outside the primary diary users exists a number of other static support characters, nearly all in some way related to Yuki, such as his posse of friends who tend to be the only logical persons in the entire show, and his parents, who range from overly relaxed to overtly greedy. The only person I can name to have anything even remotely close to character development would be Minene  (eye-patch), and the only character I honestly enjoyed having screen time for was Akise, since he tended to be the voice of reason that went regularly unheeded by Yuki. If we're all being realistic here, Akise should have been the main character of this show. He is the only person remotely close to deserving the powers of the Future Diary, and who would have used them intelligently. Many issues I had with the overall production of the show would have been lost if he had taken the center stage, even if he fails to have any compelling backstory or motivations either, because he at least would have the ability go never seeing Yuno again if he had the choice. \
Strike 3: Really, the entirety of Future Diary is based off of Yuki and Yuno's strenuous relationship, capitalized by the fact there are multiple episodes where all they do is go dress shopping or the entire abduction arc that manages to have nothing to do with the rest of the diary users. When it’s broken down, I do not understand the appeal of Yuno and Yuki together. Yuno is not maybe but totally, fully an insane person, borderline socially impaired in her level of jealously towards anyone who so much as speaks to Yuki, and not once but twice imprisons him against his will. And yet he always comes back, never because he really cares about her or fully trusts her but because Yuki needs Yuno to stay alive. Now, I'm sure if I needed someone to never be more than five feet from me in order to remain with all my body parts, I would probably have to at some point form an emotional bond with them and ultimately may fall in love. But if said person proves to be a hazard to me just as much as any of the possible assailants, than forget protection. And while if she did prove to in the end help more than hinder, than I may have considered them at least tolerable. But in the end ***spoilers*** Yuno attempts to kill Yuki anyway. And what does he do after that? Sacrifices himself in order for her, the true her, to be get a better life, under the impression that second Yuno has a different, more caring nature than the first one who killed her own self. ***spoilers end*** Now, that's a textbook example of a dependent relationship: Assuming that if you stick around for a person, you can fix them and that they have a different side to them that you just have to pull out. Spoiler alert in a different manner: This is an untruth. Life doesn’t work like that. If a person is negatively impacting your life and health, you leave them Yuki. The point is though that Yuki is just as manipulative of Yuno as she is of him, calling her his girlfriend whenever she needs him to kill someone for him / not kill someone for him, and that manipulation leads him to even mixing up needing a person to stay with you for protection as needing this person to stay around because you love them. It’s possible that Yuki even convinces himself he loves her as a survival strategy, but that treading in deeper water than this show deserves. In total, their relationship is wholly unhealthy and manipulative, and the obsession for Redail's happier ending between the two is sickening nearly.\
Final notes: What is this yandere obsession? What? Someone explain it to me. Yes I can understand its significance in School Days because it came out of practically nowhere, but why is Yuno dubbed Yandere Queen? Everyone knew she was mentally unstable and that one of them was going to have to die, so it’s not exactly like that end came out of left field, or any such killings for that matter. Really the show is set up for her to be a yandere, and yet no one comments on shows like Btooom! where the characters there kill for love as well, in equally insane situations. I guess there is some insanity threshold to classify as yandere? I enjoy its 'surprise' qualities, except in Future Diary, it truly was no surprise.\
The ending. Honestly, it has some crazy cool twists and build-ups, or at least, twists and build ups that WOULD HAVE been really crazy and cool, if the show wasn’t already burdened with dues ex to the stars and back, to the point nothing could have really come across as a surprise. And then the fact that it took like three whole episodes the complete that ending arc, dragging it on and on for far too long. The ending is one I would have loved had it been nearly any other show, because it shows real thought for the creators and as I said it was just plain cool and at least mildly original. But in the case of Future Diary, it was way too late to be cool any more. It also proved why the whole time all the other Diary users were so wary of Yuno, except how could any of them known that about her if they were not already god? Yet another thing that comes across and incredibly heavy-handed by the creators.\
To summarize, Mirai Nikki is one of those shows that is so bad that it's good. But not good in a way that we all learn from it; no, instead Future Diary is put upon some sort of pedestal the community loves to support for those 'gritty, edgy' shows. But the only thing Future Diary has going for it is the fact that it pulls us in with a stellar idea, and then keeps us around by being shocking and ridiculous just for the hell of it. The fact that this is a popular anime is almost insulting to the community at large, up there with a Human Centipede level grossness that is its own selling factor, but the fact we're all cool with that is hard to digest. I dont want to say that people cant like whatever they want, as for much as I detest Sword Art Online, Im still on good terms with people who love it to death. But this, I would love to see someone defend it's legitimacy as a moving art form, beyond pure 'entertainment' value of seeing the mentally deranged self-destruct everything and everyone around them.

    Mirai Nikki is one of the many survival based anime with 27 episodes. ( including the OVA ) However what makes this anime ultimately unique are the ranges of characters and the concept of future diaries. \
It follows Amano Yukiteru; a lonely solitary boy who writes in his diary day after day, consoling himself into a world he created by his imagination. There off the survival game starts, and the contestants true colors start to show. I would definitely recommend this to people who like action anime, as it has so many plot twists throughout the show. \
Overall I give this anime a 9 as\

    You want to know the truth about Mirai Nikki\
IT SUCKS\
Now of course that won't do so now I have to explain in great detail why it sucks which trust me won't be fun, but the people need to hear the truth. I'm not too impressed with the current reviews of this show on MAL mostly because THEY ARE NOT REVIEWS, THEY ARE FANBOY/GIRL RANTS. A review should be analytical and look from a CRITICAL standpoint. True as a flawed being I am unable to bypass my bias but at least actually i'll try.\
Mirai Nikki/Future diary is a psychological thriller.... appaently. But its also a romance,\
          \
        action, horror and fantasy show. Since words can't really define it i'll move on to the categories.\
Story-When I review anything that is a story in any regard I generally judge the storytelling itself by three categories. These categories are Premise which is the concept and basic plot outline, the execution which is how each part of the plot was handled and finally the pacing which is how these parts fit together and how natural the progression felt. Mirai Nikki's premise is actually not bad, its certainly not original but it could have worked MUCH better than it did(which is still not very good) if it had not completely fucked up everything else in the most spectacular way possible. The show starts off decently with the concept of these 'future diaries' being introduced but instead of explaining them and how they work the show immidiately throws you into a cascade of bullshit.\
 Mirai Nikki is horrendously cliche while at the same time making no sense. The show dosen't have plot holes as some say, it IS a plot hole.  The concept of telling the future already opens up lots of room for narrative fuck ups but the show also breaks basic logic almost consistently just so it can appear more 'dark' and 'daring'. This is why Mirai Nikki shoots itself in the foot, it tries to be mature by adding in lots of gore and crazy twists but ends up going the other way and feeling ridiculous because of how little sense it makes and ultimately feels childish and stupid. The pacing is breakneck and never slows down apart from pointless filler episodes that add nothing and just kill any tension that would be there in the first place.\
 The romance aspect fails because it STILL feels shoehorned in despite being a major plot point and because the characters(who we'll get to later) are annoying and don't make a good couple. As for the thriller aspect and the future diary concept itself, well it could have been cool but it tried way too hard to make the audience take it seriously despite it not being very original, interesting or thrilling at all. It tried a 'Death note' approach of mixing supernatural powers and mind games but for some reason forgot that it wasn't as smart or well written as that show and just made all its characters seem like complete morons(moreso than they already are). The ending to the show is horrible and unsatisfiying while the ending to the OVA is ridiculous and contrived so its a lose-lose there. In terms of themes obviously there's not much to say except that this show handled sensitive topics like rape and abuse with all the care and subtlety of a bull in a fucking china shop and at times came off as either disgusting, exploitative or offensive rather than just edgy bullshit thrown in to hold the interest of people watching this train wreck.\
Score-2,5/10 Stupid, contrived, ridiculous, nonsensical and at times offensive \
Characters-You'd think that after bashing the general plot so much that would be my least favourite aspect but no somehow prehaps by the gods of awful writing this show has characters so laughably bad it even overshadows the godawful plot. All the character are given one note personalities and often ridiculous, overblown defining traits so the show can continue to shove logic up its ass and blow shit up for the sake of encapsulating more mindless casuals in its insanity. Characterization for most of the diary holders(who are the main focus character-wise) is limited to a short backstory which makes us either feel sorry for them or hate them depending on what one dimensional hack is getting 2 minutes of backstory in the middle of a episode because PLOT CONVINENCE and gives them a motivation before they are killed by the main characters. So you'd think aside from the 10+ other diary holders there would be some good development for the main two characters Yuki and Yuno right? NOPE.\
 Yukiteru is basically hack Shinji Ikari in that he is a similar archetype but isn't explored in enough depth and has all of Shinji's undesirable traits magnified by 1000. Aside from being annoying he gets no real development and dosen't really do anything meaningful in the story. And now for everyone's favorite yandere, Gasai Yuno!.... is a godawful character. Many find her crazy actions fun and exciting but in my opinion its creepy and she really isn't well developed or believable, and even if she was entertaining to watch you shouldn't force yourself through a show for one character and if you do you have low standards and would probably like this show anyway.\
Characters-1.6/10 Cliche, one note, underdeveloped, annoying and sometimes creepy(not in a good way)\
Art-The artstyle is very bland and dosen't help the series stand out in any way, there's too many bright colours and it ends up looking like a mashed fruit bowl and dosen't fit the supposedly dark tone the series is trying to give off(key word being 'trying'). The character designs are cartoony and undistinct and none really stand out. Its pretty standard stuff, weird hair colours+large crazy eyes which I guess fits but seeing how bland the characters were anyway it only makes them blander. Some of the character designs are totally ridculous and goofy which once again you'd think might fit seeing as how silly the series is but then you remeber its actually trying to take itself seriously, FAIL.You'd think the series would have really good animation to show off all its fight scenes and gore but its kind of underwhelming. The animation in the opening sequences is pretty cool and unique though the way it presents itself is slightly pretentious considering how bland and uninteresting the rest of the animation was. I always consider animation to be less important than story and characters so therre's not much to say unless its good or it fits the series, in this case it is neither\
Animation-5.2/10 BLAND\
Sound-Well as for the music it can be summed up in a similar way to the story in that it tries to create a creepy and disturbing atmosphere and as music alone its not that bad. Its mostly techno/electronic with some more experimental flashes here and there and also synth strings and the like to build tension and some piano when the plot is trying to be emotional. It would fit the tone of the show well if the show itself knew what tone it actually had and on top of that none of the tracks stand out or are that well composed. Even if the series had been better the OST is rather cliche and typical of modern thriller anime. Special mention must go however to the first opening song which is FUCKING AMAZING, the song is easily the best attached to the series and really gets you hyped(even if it is for nothing).\
 The voice acting in Japanese is decent as Japanese dubs are rarely terrible but nothing stood out and the actors sounded either bored or overacted the scenes but seeing as what they had to work with I really acn't blame them. Also, Yuno's seiyuu got annoying very quickly but the constant screams of \"YUKIII\" in the script are probably to blame for that. I must admit that I have not seen the English dub but quite frankly I really don't want to as 1.I don't wanna sit through this mess again and 2. Even fans of the show hold it to be godawful and judging by their standards on things my reaction to it may be enough to crush my jaded, snobbish mind for good. Just be thankful I haven't so I still exist to write this review and don't give the sound a lower score\
Sound 4.8/10 MOSTLY BECAUSE OF OPENING 1, bland OST and acting everywhere \
Enjoyment-For some anime fans, watching this trainwreck may actually be an enjoyable experience as it has plenty of action and twists to keep people who are capable of turning their brain off(or don't have one to begin with) entertained. Unfortunately if I turned my brain off I would cease to be so for anyone who isn't capable of this the show will almost constantly piss you off and make you feel dirty and be generally not a positive experience especially if you favour substance, good writing and subtlety over shock value. If you base enjoyment on getting cheap thrills, shocks and favour spectacle and scale over substance then you might actually enjoy it. Keep in mind that this is not praise for the show but merely my explanation as to its popularity and NOT how I believe one should judge a show. \
Enjoyment 2.0/10 since I have to base it on my own enjoyment\
Final scores\
ONS(Overall narrative score, Story+Characters/2)=2.05 Grade: F\
OAS(Overall aesthetic score, Art+Sound/2)=5.00 Grade: D\
OFS(Overall final score, average of all categories)=3.22 Grade: E\
Conclusion-If I had to describe Mirai Nikki in one word it would be clusterfuck, it tried its hand at so much random shit and not only failed at pulling that off but also managed to fuck up each individual aspect and is a disgusting trainwreck of edgy bullshit.\
 If you are entertained by shallow nonsense of this kind then feel free to rage at me all you want. I just think MAL reviewers need to be more critical when reviewing their favourite shows otherwise it becomes a fanboy rant/gush site rather than a legitmate place to find people's critical opinions on anime.\

    This is my first review so please go gentle on me (>^.^)>\
This review will contain some minor spoilers, so please beware.\
I'm a big fan of this anime, but I'll try to give an unbiased review and will look at the positives and negatives.\
I haven't watched that many animes so I may not be able to dig up on some topics/criticism.\
Now, lets get onto the actual review :D\
Mirai Nikki was an anime that is based around survival, deception and trust, it has many plot twists throughout the 26 episodes, with the characters often deceiving the main characters (Yuno Gasai and Yukiteru Amano) which  gives a\
          \
        sense of unpredictability and not knowing which characters are good or bad. \
The story is one of the most original I've seen, it is full of plot twists as I stated earlier, and keeps the viewer engaged in the show. It revolves around the idea of \"Kill or be killed\" and \"survival of the fittest\" which develops into a much more complex story line towards the end of the anime, leaving many questions unanswered and many plot holes. Overall, the story was good and original, with plot twists however, it also has many plot holes.\
The animation was fluid and the art was good, nothing else to be said here :| \
The sound was great, the music fitted each scene and created a sense of tension in the anime, once again, nothing more to say :|\
The characters were either over-baked or cliches, regardless, they were very interesting and unpredictable to a degree, Yuno was probably the most interesting to watch,with her yandere personality often making her hard to predict. Tsubaki's real nature was a big shock to me, and that shows how deceptive and twisted this show can be. 5th wasn't the best choice of character, a 5 year old murderer doesn't really add a sense of realism, rather the opposite - A sense of fantasy, although then again, this is anime, not real life. \
Yuki is a weak-minded male lead, who thinks a thousand times before doing anything and often panics quickly, accompanied with Yuno, his \"Stalker\"who is obsessed with Yuki and will protect him at ALL costs.\
9th was one of my favorites, she had an original character, was quick witted and unpredictable. She played a significant role towards the end.\
Overall, the characters had original personalities with different back stories, some characters were cliches or over-baked, nonetheless they were good.\
I thoroughly enjoyed mirai nikki and it is one of my favorites, I recommend it to anyone that enjoys: Romance, action, blood, dark fantasy and psychological thrillers. \
Overall my personal rating of mirai nikki is a 10/10 however for the purpose of this review and not solely being about my enjoyment, I give it a 9/10.\

    This is masterpiece. This series have everything you want in one: outstanding story, great soundtrack, unique characters and beautiful art. It keeps you wondering what'll happen from one of first episodes to end. Also everything there have ideal proportions. Where should be drama, there's drama, but before you'll start to be bored by this it suddenly changes to different type. And over, and over. When there should be blood, there's blood, but not too much. When there should be something more intense like corpse or something like this, it is, but for a brief time. Enough to satisfy and not enough to make you feel\
          \
        disgusted. And there are 26 episodes of this! I must say that I enjoyed every episode of this awesome series. I also should mention the end. People, believe or not, studio asread made somethind very unusual - satisfying end. Everything is complete, and everything is explained. You actually enjoy even the end of this series! I must say that no matter how I search, I just cannot find major flaw in Mirai Nikki. Better - it's hard to me just finding minor flaws. So far this is the best rated by me anime that I ever made review of. I don't have anything more to say. Just watch it. Now.\

    I’ve never watched Mirai Nikki in a literal way. The very first episode introduces the show as utterly absurd and in no way to be taken seriously. In one scene there’s a murder taking place by a psycho serial killer with the most blatant ‘this man is a serial killer’ character design you’ll ever see (stereotypical sorts of designs are used for most of the cast). In another scene, you’ll see the main character talking to a garishly rendered CGI God, and then he receives a cell phone that has access the future from God. \
Mirai Nikki throws so many ideas into the fray and\
          \
        lets them run wild without caring if they get out of hand. \
Story: 6/10\
To start I'll say Mirai Nikki's story is far from perfect, the author clearly took on more than he could handle without understanding his limits. Time travel, Gods, dozens of characters, clairvoyant cellphones, but that doesn't excuse the fact that he gets almost nothing right. However, due to the fact that this a battle royale story it is formulaic by nature and very comprehensible. So at the very least, you won't be confused. \
The story begins with an uncertain love between the wimpy protagonist Yuki Amano and the borderline insane Yuno Gasai begins to take a parasitic-like root, they're both thrusts into a survival game with 10 other contestants in which the last man standing will become the next God of the universe. Each contestant has access to the future via cell phone diaries which are each represented by a different quirk. Their journey to survive the vicious but vibrant battle royale is a thrilling and engaging one indeed. With a slew of wild and varying rivals to face off against, Yuki and Yuno do everything they can to survive, pushing themselves to the limit in the process. Yuno spends a lot of her screentime on trying to please Yuki while he fears her and cowers behind her while in combat. Her desire to become the center of his universe stems some viciously dark humor as well as tension; it's hard to feel a safeness for the characters while Yuno is onscreen. She's the most unpredictable wildcard out of all of the contestants. The fast pace keeps the show constantly engaging, never does the show drag on but it also has enough slow and personal moments to keep it from becoming breakneck. Constantly they jump from one vicious killer to the next, and as death is certain in a battle royale they never fight one for very long. \
Right from the first episode, the show makes no qualms about how ridiculous it is, it embraces the insanity wholeheartedly. Yuki and Yuno literally meet God and then kill their teacher who also happens to be a psychopathic serial killer. Although the story’s hammy it mostly is just a frame to set up the insane adventure without demanding much explanation for why the logic is so absurd, it’s a show about god giving a bunch of psychopaths cell phones that access to the future. \
Did people really expect Mirai Nikki to take itself seriously? I didn't and that's a big reason why I like it.\
Plenty of plot holes that appear especially towards the end of the series that are caused by the author putting the confused logic at the forefront of the story. On the subject of the show's ending, I can't say it's the best due to the conflicted logic, but in my opinion, it is a satisfying conclusion to the main characters’ arcs. The additional OVA, Redial, also adds a bit more to the ending by offering up more explanations and a satisfying recount of the supporting cast seen throughout the main story.\
While Mirai Nikki is enjoyable to laugh at its abundance of flaws, I would feel uncomfortable calling it so-bad-its good without it actually having some meaningful content. For me to consider a show as good trash would be a\
For each rival (or as the show calls them, “diary user”) Yuki and Yuno confront they change a bit, learning something from them and then moving on to the next. The breakneck speed at which the story shifts is what makes me call it dream-like, but the fact that those shifts are horrific and reflect some of my worst fears is what makes me call it a nightmare. Those fears are what you’d expect a teenager of the Yuki’s age to have. They’re extremely exaggerated in the show to be in keeping with the rest of the nightmare. But still, a fear is a fear and they can be applied to anyone who’s coming to terms with growing up. A few examples of the horrors; of losing your family and friends, being trapped in a toxic relationship, the finality of being married to someone you don’t love, having children… eeek, and most of all, of the future. There are a few more if you dig further, but the big one is really a fear of the future. \
What kid wouldn’t fear the future, becoming an adult? Not many at first, I know I didn’t until I saw how harsh life could be on my parents. Simply seeing adults as brave and all knowing is the ignorance we all start with. Once we see how harsh the world really is, we begin to understand growing up, you fear it. \
While I wouldn’t call Mirai Nikki strictly a coming of age story, it has elements of one tossed into the rest of the swill that makes up the story. \
Well, that’s enough sentimentality, for now, let's dive into the diary users.\
Characters: 8/10\
What the characters lack in depth the more than make up for with bombastic personalities and striking designs. \
What’s more is, they’re all assholes. Villians. You'll hate who they are and the things they do, but their overblown personalities are precisely what makes them so entertaining. They manipulate, they mercilessly kill, but their engagement comes from watching them grow and change. Despite having morals that you may not agree with, it is interesting to see them follow them diligently and try to explain away their madness. Each of the twelve contestants is granted a future diary that reflects an aspect of their background. For example; the main character’s diary logs everything he sees in the world around him because he’s a very passive person who chooses to observe rather than contribute. These personal diaries add an extra level to the characters, however, I felt like they didn't get explored enough; usually the diaries a little more than an excuse for some deus ex machina twists. \
Yuki and Yuno get the majority of the screen time, so if you’re not interested in them or the dynamics of their relationship then you’ll probably have a bad time. \
Their struggle to comprehend their feelings for each other feels realistic for people their age, even compounded with the struggle of the oncoming attacks from their merciless adversaries. \
Fans of this show seem to go nuts over Yuno and I don't really get why other than most of them are teenage boys looking for an anime lady to direct their hormones towards. As a character, she's fairly interesting for her yandere insanity, but just she lacks the depth necessary to be believable. I'd rather consider her to be an eldritch monster, a force of nature, that wouldn't be out of place in a nightmare. The disturbing ends she drives Yuki to are what makes her so scary, the ways she manipulates him and uses his weakness against him yet claims its all for love’s sake. There are people who treat their significant others like she treats Yuki, but obviously, their toxic relationship is much more exaggerated like everything else in the show. \
If you don't already fear being trapped in a toxic co-dependent relationship, then watch Mirai Nikki and you surely will. \
Most of the diary users are adults and their encounters with Yuki and Yuno reflect that theme of growing up and realize how harsh the world is. They’re all assholes do horrible things for their own selfish reasons. It’s almost hilarious how on point the author’s commentary on adults is when Yuki puts his trust in the police chief diary user expecting to be protected, then being disappointed. Then there’s Minene, the diary user who gets the most screen time apart from the two leads. She’s an adult who’s constantly reminded in her nightmares of the time when she first realized what the real world is like. And this nightmare is, of course, just as far-fetched as the rest of the show. \
It wouldn’t be Mirai Nikki without its patent absurdity! \
Notice how I never used the word 'believable' when describing the characters? Well yeah, that's because they aren't. Sure, some of the qualities they bear are similar to people, but they're distinctly inhuman. People might look down at me for saying this, but their unbelievability is intentional and necessary to the show. Well, the intentional part is definitely obvious. I mean really, just look at them. Their unbelievability only draws attention to what they are rather than who they are. After all, a bad dream is a bad dream. Even if they approach realism, in the end, they're anything but.\
[Audiovisual: 7.5/10]\
Kickass soundtrack. Also, the first op is one of the best ever made; loaded with irony and a fast-paced song that's equally edgy as it is thrilling. The second one is alright but as usual, it’s not nearly as good as the first. Both ending songs are great, they harshly set-in-stone the emotion that is evoked by each episodes cliff-hanger ending. The voice actors did a great job with wonderfully overdone performances, especially Yuno’s voice actress. Each character’s voice is incredibly exaggerated which only sells their insanity further. \
Despite being released in 2011 the visuals are relatively dated. The art varies in quality but is good during key moments. The use of color adds so much to hold your attention; the purples, blues, and especially reds are used the most to further exaggerate an already bewildering atmosphere. \
The characters all have varying designs that give you a sense of who they are or who they want to be perceived as before they even speak. Most of them are over-the-top and impossible to take seriously.\
Some of the slower scenes of just everyday activities between the action had lower animation quality. Usually, if the characters are far from the camera during action scenes Asread utilizes CGI characters, they look decent but that’s due to their distance and infrequent use. \
What saves the visuals the most is the direction. While I wouldn't call it masterclass, it gets the job done well enough. The action is well telegraphed so you understand what's happening and where it is. Plenty of scenes subtly use foreshadowing/symbolism to give you a nagging sense of fear for where the story will go.\
The director uses light (ie: sun) and dark (ie: shadows) to set the tone and indicate a tonal transition. For example, in one scene Yuki and Yuno walk down a hill away from the sunset into the gloomy night below. A scene like that does a great job at setting tone and foreshadowing. Scenes like this further reinforce my opinion that Mirai Nikki is good and is actually made with effort and a fair bit of talent.\
[Enjoyment: 10/10]\
Once it starts, it doesn't let up, not even for a moment. Pure insanity contrasted with the occasional quiet moment to show the audience that the characters are humans under their frightening personas. The director juggles comedy and the edgy action but doesn’t overlap them in an annoying or off-putting way. I think a lot of people saw Mirai Nikki and couldn’t decide what to make of its varying genres. Personally, it added a lot to keep me entertained, but I could see that aspect turning people off. Make sure to expect a comedy and a thriller before watching.\
Coincidentally, Mirai Nikki's greatest weaknesses—the overabundance of plot holes, continuity errors, and leaps in logic—also happen to be its greatest strengths. I always found it laughable when a vey obvious and story affecting hole appeared. Whether it be the future diaries either working better than the story set up in the beginning, or worse to fit the flow of a scene. \
Despite a few really awkward and sometimes tasteless (and totally skippable) nudity scenes that break the show’s crazy flow, it is a pure thrill ride of action and humor.  \
[Final Score: 8/10]\
What a thrill ride Mirai Nikki is. But there's more too it. Maybe I read into it more than the author intended, but that’s what I got out of it. You might too! But you have to be willing to approach it unbiasedly, with no expectations of how bad you may have heard it is. \
I hope my reasons for liking came across well enough. Thanks for reading!\

    Dear diary, \
I always watched anime, even as a kid although I didn't know what anime actually were. About four years ago I found out what anime really means, and one of the first anime I watched as a \"full time\" AnimeGirl was Mirai Nikki or Future Diary. That's why, in this review I will write about this, kinda special, anime show. \
-Your AnimeGirl\
 Plot and Storyline \
Well, the first thing you'll probably say after you finish this anime is:\"What on Earth was that?\". \
Mirai Nikki is, I promise you, the most psychopathic anime you'll see in your life. But that is exactly what it\
          \
        makes this anime different from all the others. \
In the very beginning we meet Amano Yukiteru (Yuki), a rather shy and anti-social. Poor Yuki, his only friend is a imaginary god called Deus ex Machina(This is a phrase that comes from the Latin language and actually means \"God from the Machine, but never mind, let's move on)-The God of Time and Space. Too bad, this Deus is not imaginary at all. He soon makes Yuki participate in an survivor game where the winner becomes the next God. Here's the thing now. There are twelve contestants, and everyone of them has a diary that predicts them the future, each diary in it's own way. The last one alive is the new God. Yuki was very lucky, because after the game begun Yuno, his classmate, decided to protect him.And damn, that girl has some awesome skills. Now that everything's set, Let the bloodshed begin!\
The fact that all of you should know is that beneath every layer that makes this anime as it is you have the core of it. And it's believe it or not, a Love Story. That's right, the romance between the main characters is the \"engine\" that drives the whole story on. But it indeed is sort of a psychotic love. The romance between Yuki and Yuno is in the beginning rather a one sided love, but after a long \"on and off\" relationship, and some ups and downs they made it. But don't think of it as a boring love story, it'll definitely be the craziest one you'll ever see. Don't miss it.\
Now let's focus a bit on the other contestants. They also made one part of the show, and contributed to it everyone in their own way by letting us know about their past. Their back stories play an important part in the show and make it interesting too. And besides, the more villains the better the show, right?\
Mirai Nikki wouldn't be Mirai Nikki if there weren't this many plot twists. That's crazy how much surprise lies in each episode. The makers really did a great job. A lot of anime makers get lost while \"twisting\" the plot and the result is a mash of unrelatable stories that just confuse you, and ruin the story as a whole. Future Diary is not the case, the story line was not ruined, it was exciting and interesting till the very end.  \
Talking about the end, it will take much concentration if you want to understand why everything so far happened. So keep calm, and if you don't understand something watch it again. It is not so hard to understand but it becomes a mash of things that happened in the past, some other dimensions and the present that's complicated alone on its own.\
This is in short the story of The Future Diary, or something like that.\
 Characters \
Well, if this is not a crazy bunch of personalities. This thriller anime really bombed me with mostly crazy, then funny, irritating etc. characters. \
The important thing about the personalities of the characters is that their diaries kinda reflect their personality, hobby, job etc. \
In this way trough the knowledge of the diary type you can easily guess a part of the diary user, which I found very interesting.\
YUNO GASAI is the sickest character ever. Still, I loved her for being like that. She was funny, awesome and always full of surprises. You really never know what that girl's gonna do next. She is also clever, fighting with both strength and mind. A lot of people hate her character because she is a psycho, but there is not a single character that could be compared to her. She looks like a cute, little girl that is possessed by an evil demon that she can't control. One one side you have her soft and caring side, and in an instant of time she turns in a killer machine.Typical Yandere. But the most important thing to tell about her is her ability to love. It's something like this: \"I love you so much that I'll kill you so nobody else does\". That's really something. Yuno you truly are awesome.  \
I literary hate this guy. He is one of the most irritating characters I've ever seen. AMANO YUKITERU or YUKI is a perfect example of a cry-baby. He is a anti-social mother's son who gets scared in a second. He always depends on someone else and hardly gets something done on his own. But, I have to say that he had an immense character development in the end. It was a totally different Yuki than the one we had in the beginning. He becomes a bit stronger and more independent in the end. The thing that made me not hate him that much was the OVA episode Mirai Nikki Redial, whre he...(now this would be a huge spoiler). However, I can't get the similarity between him and Shu from Guilty Crown aout of my head. \
Animation\
The animation in this anime is satisfactory. It is not breath-taking but it is good. There are two things that I'd like to commend. Fistly the character look of Yuno. It is amazing how they handled to make her look cute and creepy at the same time. Amazing. \
The second thing is the opening. It is kinda done in an interesting way, and the mix of fastly moving screens and the creepy music were perfect. But it really gives someone the creeps. \
Conclusion\
If you like action, fights and thriller you will love this anime. If you want a good love story you will also love this anime. Mirai Nikki has something for everybody. Don't listen to people who say it is just a story about a sick girl that is in love. NO! Future Diary is definitely more than that. It is catchy, interesting and extremely amusing. I enjoyed watching it, I am sure you'll too. MIRAI NIKKI!\

    There are three types of people who will dislike this anime:\
1. People who are Genre rigid. This show is action, thriller, mystery, romance, comedy, etc. and often likes to shift from episode to episode or arc to arc. I personally can not place this series purely into one genre\
2. People who are looking for a stable story. This show has more of a general story that changes as a result of the game. This is natural given that many characters initially DO NOT WANT to play the game and are FORCED to play it. Naturally, morality is thrown around and a simple story with a\
          \
        clearly defined goal isn't present.\
3. People who cannot suspend their disbelief over the slightest thing. There are moments in this story where you ask yourself \"Why don't they just kill them and be done with it?\" which can be frustrating. There are also moments where a character will do something illogical. While these problems sound glaring, they don't take you out of the anime, and simply leave you with a \"I wouldn't have done that\" thought as the story continues. \
If you got past that, welcome to my review of Future Diary. Future Diary was one of the best animes, no series, I have ever seen in my life. \
Story:\
The premise is this: There is this Time God who only seems to be known my introverts and outcasts. He decides to throw a \"to the death\" tournament to see who will take over his role of god. Each person is given a different \"power\" to their cell phone diaries that give them an edge in this competition.\
The story is built around this idea initially, with some of the \"players\" wanting to win and become a god, and others who just want to be left alone. \
This all begins to change as personal events unfold that cause people to become more actively involved. Each diary itself has a different and unique power, but the power is unique to the user specifically for the most part. \
A lot of people found the ending to be unsatisfying, but to me it seemed more like the logical conclusion with the exception of some minor continuity issues. The only fault in this series typically comes from characters. \
Characters: \
Imagine someone you love romantically, real or not, obessively so. Imagine you have a journal or diary that confirms at the very end that you will end up with this person. Imagine being in said game above and that person also being a fellow competitor. Imagine that said person is also a bit helpless and will not survive unless you get involved. Imagine your diary also keeps track of what is happening to that person, so you can help them whenever you can. \
However, deep down you know that even if you help them, there is going to come a point where it's only going to be the two of you left in the game. This is the MAIN character, Yuno.\
Many people wouldn't call Yuno the main character since she is not the focus character. However, the series essentially is all about her and the actions she takes. She is psychologically unstable and is THE definition of a stalker taken to the extreme. \
Yukki, her love interest, is essentially a bit cowardly, but has nerves of steel once in awhile that helps keep him and the others alive. He is the focus character of the series, but doesn't really act like a protagonist until near the end. He is more like the \"Damsel in Distress\" of this series, naively getting himself into trouble. It was a good move for the series to make him the focus character since it makes him more likable and since Yuno has the stronger story. \
Yukki's friends are okay. Not much to say since I'd be spoiling the series. Luckily, they only really appear in the series to serve as support when more important stuff is going on, so their lack of development is not painful.\
The other diary users I felt were written very well. They all had motivations and different ways of trying to achieve their goals. Some people might feel that they didn't give them enough story, but the story really isn't about them and that is what people may miss and that is why they were written well. Most of the users and their perspectives are told through the lens of Yukki, and this sometimes confuses the audience into thinking they are main characters when in fact they are simply well written support. \
What are the problems with the characters? Well, some of the characters act almost too honorably given the situation, and instead of crushing their opposition they may prefer to toy with them instead. Other times, the characters seem to act dishonorably and betray each other. While this makes sense from an emotional stand point, causing Yuno and Yukki's relationship get closer despite understandable apprehension Yukki has with this, it sort of comes across as nonsensical to the character's motivation. In fact, there is so much of this that goes on that it made me feel that only Yuno was reliable and predictable. Which again works from the series stand point but takes away a bit of the realism from the support cast.\
Enjoyment:\
I really liked this series and the twists that resulted from it. I consumed this anime over the course of a night and the following day, which is to say a lot as to how drawn in I was. The last, 4 or 3 episodes I felt less invested in, but didn't drain from how great the rest of the series was. There are even subtle, one scene or one line incidents that change your perspectives on characters, or the story itself. \
I recommend it as a MUST SEE. There are areas it could have improved in, could have made the characters a little more realistic, and could have ended it in different ways to convey different tones. However, I believe the few mistakes or over-sights that were made are worth the sacrifice of building up a stronger emotional investment. \
I challenge you to watch episode 1-6  (or 4 at the earliest) and see if you're not interested enough to see what happens next. \

    The future holds many surprises for us. At least for our main character Amano Yukiteru who has been caught up in a battle royale game including 11 other people for the purpose of becoming the next God over time and space. He was given a cellphone which updates his future entries for his diary and makes it a future diary for him to use in the game. \
As one can see, the scores and reviews for this anime varies a lot. Some people can't stand it while others, like myself, absolutely love the series. \
Story (10): Battle royales aren't anything new. But Mirai Nikki makes\
          \
        this much more interesting by giving all players in the game a future diary which can predict the future and makes it possible for all the players to change their future and put a - DEAD END - flag on another person. This is what makes Mirai Nikki so great. You never know what will happen or what to expect. \
That aside, the story revolving the extremly yandere Yuno, the second main character, who we don't know who she is, where she's from or what she's thinking, builds up a lot of suspicion around her and makes the series even more thrilling to watch. \
Art (8): The art is great. They've paid much attention to the details. There's a lot of fighting going on in the series and they've managed to make the art for that really good. Form, color, details... everything's great, BUT, the reason why I didn't give it a full 10 is for one reason. The sizes of the characters, weather it's their boobs, height, butt or whatever, they change from episode from episode. That was the only less good thing. \
Sound (10): Both openings (Kuusou Mesorogiwi and Dead End) were well done. They chose the music wisley for the openings. I actually felt like I was going psycho myself after hearing Kuusou Mesorogiwi. o_O \
After every episode there is an ending too. And the endings kept the exciting, suspicious feeling you've had while watching the episode. Some endings are like a cock block after an episode but that wasn't the fact for Mirai Nikki. Other than that the sound really fits for the anime. The tension builds up even more with the music. \
Character (9): All characters were well thought out, well done and had strong personalities. Some were annoying, some were horrifyingly scary, some were hilarious. The strong varieties of personalities, the details and all background stories for every character made them feel alive. You have some kind of hate and love relationship to all of them. Sometimes Yuno was adorable and sometimes her psycho-mode hit and she became frightening. The only character that both I and others were annoyed of was... Yukiteru, the main character. But not only he developed, all of them did. Great job!\
Enjoyment/Overall (10): This is a thrilling, frightening, well thought out and pcychologial anime at its best. The story develops into something you never could imagine, making you stand at the tip of your toes all the time. The cliffhangers, the surprises and the revelations. I just have one word to say. Wow. \

    I'll be VERY honest.\
This is probably the first anime that I've been blown away by.\
It left be in a state of depression when I finished it because it was over...\
So I had to rewatch it over and over again. Then afterwards I couldn't ever be content with an anime again without thinking \"Wow... Mirai Nikki was so much better...\"\
I may be exaggerating, but it's my opinion. This anime was just my perfect cup of tea!\
WARNING: I CANNOT GUARANTEE SPOILER FREE\
(I'm sorry it's so hard not to give away the story when talking about this anime!)\

Story\
The story goes to tell you about what happens in this\
          \
        survival game and you get to meet all the people in the game. You get to know everyone pretty well and learn their past history (apart from 1 person, but he wasn't that important). So when you see how everything links together, it becomes a really exciting story.\
Also there is a beautiful balance between how much is focused on the main characters and how much is focused on side characters.\
It also has a nice balance of serious parts and the little drops of humour so it isn't so heavy on the story.\
There are some err ecchi parts, so if you don't deal well with it, I recommend skipping it. It can easily be ignored if you want.\
However, it isn't perfect.\
There was one episode which had a MASSIVE section of two people having this game of hide and seek in a house. (I mean there was more to it, but it was just a boring chase scene) So I just skipped that part.\
Also there were parts in this anime where I felt like it was just SO unneeded and rather pointless.\
BUT. Then it helped to build up the next part and so on and so on.\
The story is mainly a give and take game.\
It provides you with so many thrills and then every now and again you have to give back a little patience and time and then you're rewarded with a thrill!\
The ending left me speechless... I think that's all I got to say for that...\
--\
Art\
Animation was very well done!\
It was dynamic and story especially in the fight scenes.\
Facial expressions were done really well, and it helped to show the strong emotions!\
Designs were done well and I haven't a problem with any of the art.\
--\
Sound\
Voice acting was really good in my opinion, though every now and again Yuki's voice did annoy me slightly that it sounded slightly too girly, but other than that I haven't a problem with it.\
Sound effects were hit and miss. Mainly hit, but some of them sounded a little cheesy and cheap.\
The 1st and 2nd opening and the 1st ending are really good in my opinion.\
I really love them~! As for the 2nd ending, I wasn't such a fan...\
--\
Characters\
People may complain that too many of them are psychopaths but I think that's the point of this story.\
Personally I really liked them, and there was a nice balance of them all.\
I like how I felt I had this love/hate relationship with Yuno, I thought that was really good.\
I wished there was more of 10th in the anime though, when he appeared I thought he'd be the weird/funny/scary bad guy, but he didn't get that much in the story to do.\
--\
Overall I REALLY REALLY REALLY enjoyed this.\
I hope you do too!\
 It's such a brilliant anime and it needs more recognition! \

    Mirai Nikki also known as The Future Diary has an outstanding story. The story is full of mysteries wherein it makes you think a lot. Usually it makes the story good. Looking for answers and clues. \
Don't be spoiled when you watch this. You won't enjoy the story if you already know what happens. It's full of  action and mysteries, romance as well. \

    In a way, Mirai Nikki is a little like Gantz: the same \"fight for survival\" theme driving the entire storyline. But for me, this anime is so much more interesting to watch. There's a lot of violence but not in an excessive way and the story constantly keeps you on your toes with no boring bits. The characters (though crazy) are memorable and intriguing. \
For me, Yuno's yandere character especially hit the spot. Her obsessive love for Yuuki is both disturbing AND kind of sweet...which is all the more satisfying when that love is somehow returned. I won't spoil any of the plot but the\
          \
        relationship development between Yuno and Yuki was one of the major reasons why I like the anime. \
The story itself is fast paced and visually stimulating in a Battle Royale/Hunger Games-esque way...so much that you won't have time to get bored. You really need to watch it to understand which is why I recommend it to everyone!\

    When I first heard Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) appears estimate that this anime tells the arrival of someone from the future and provide records to the protagonists of future disasters and prevent disaster or simply like the anime \"Steins; Gate\". But while watching it all the estimates were wrong because Mirai Nikki (fuure diary) the theme of a different, more creative, more curious, more interesting and arguably even more thrilling and full of emotion. Sometimes there are good stories, sometimes there are stories poignant, sometimes annoying and sometimes there is a story of regret..\
Can I say Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) is a very interesting anime,\
          \
        the author has an incredible imagination in which many young people today to write a diary in Phone. Seeing this situation the author gives a different impression in which the diary was turned into a diary that can predict what will happen in the future according to what is usually written by the user. The more interesting part of this anime is a competition where competition is eliminated fellow users and the winner will be able to realize all that God desires. But the story is not that easy, pull all the users have a different diary so as not to know the strengths and weaknesses of the enemy. Because of this Mirai Nikki interesting, the story is not predictable, there is always a new story, a lot of surprises and always make a curious.\
Story: 9/10\
This story is not simple, always interesting change in the direction in which we demonstrated in the early episodes of bystander boy whose lives are only concerned with his self and ignoring the situation around, but when he gets Mirai Nikki his life changed drastically would not want him to fight if not then he will die.\
Full of emotional stories, because the audience will be confronted with the background story of each character and why they wanted to be God. Starting from Yukiteru (the protagonist) who want to God because he wanted to revive his parents. Yuno who want to be a companion Yukiteru (the protagonist) because he was the only person who understands the situation and want to be a companion of her life. Keigo's detective who wants to heal his son. Marco who want happy Ai because he promised to always live happily together. The mother (Kamado) who want to see their children happy. John (mayor) who just want power. Minene (terrorists) who want justice by her self. Tsubaki (astrologer) who wants to turn back her happiness.\
The story is full of mystery as a puzzle start coming Yuno who suddenly came Yukiteru and said that she is the savior. Not only that but also the mystery of who the opponents are and who our allies because here Yukiteru actually made the audience was definitely confused and wondered what would happen next. The story becomes very interesting when all the contestants pursue Yukiteru, because these circumstances he became hostile to all men and just trust Yuno because only she who is always at his side and always helpful. When in the middle episode we'll be hating the protagonist (Yukitru and Yuno) because they killed all the people and betrayed their friend, but apparently this is where the psychology that we are given a choice between \"Drop\" or \"Watch\" drop if we include those less patient, but if we Watch it we are people curious. We will be satisfied when the last episode and then we can make a conclusion of this story.\
Art: 8/10\
Including the design of \"Dark\" because there are so many massacres, broken arms, a severed head and the wound is not natural but unfortunate lack of added effect of graphics so the picture looks just plain awful and less when it is Dark Anime. When talking about the character designs, there is no difference to most anime. Here that stands out is the design of the nature of God and the world will be destroyed. One again the greatness of the graphic art of the surprise appearance of the characters that the audience is not ready to be surprised, but to make a picture like this required precision of timing, circumstances and the picture of a different character for example is when the Yukiteru opens a secret roomYuno and Yukiteru was surprised because there is a skull and suddenly Yuno emerge from the side of the protagonist's face with a sinister figure.\
Character: 9/10\
What I like about the character here is that they are human figures today. If in most anime characters are always a perfect imaging from a strong, protective, romantic and intelligent. But at Mirai Nikki all the characters are human figures in today's start of a bystander Yukiteru obvious nowadays many people are only concerned with themself. Yandere Yuno that figure or in the language of psychology \"psychopath\" are like that because she was tortured during his lifetime and not have compassion. Minenen who want independence according to her. Keigo is only pursuing a career and rank. John is greedy. Marco is willing to die for Ai. And Kamado who sacrifice everything for their children. I'm sure the author did research before deciding to make a character like this\
.\
But if we continue to watch this anime then this character will have evolved so that the audience did not feel bored. Yukiteru finally decided to become a fighter because of circumstances and environment, and eventually he became an adult figure. Minene who decided to become a good person and a family\
Enjoyment: 9/10\
During watching this anime, I kept asking myself why this and why thath. It turned out that the author managed to make me curious until I can not wait for every Monday. Actually I do not like gore and violence, and this anime a lot of people die not fair but this animie always makes me curious inevitably forced to see the cruelty Yukiteru and Yuno but luckily it all ended happily be at least able to pay off.\
Overall: 9/10\
Overall success of the anime genre psychology, mystery and thriller. Anime is not for kids, but for those who are prepared mentally and anime lovers of mystery. Hopefully you are not disappointed when watching it ^ _ ^",

\
STORY\
Apart from the ending in my opinion Mirai nikki has one of the best stories ive seen in a long time in a anime.\
Essentially the plot is based around a survival game where 12 individuals are given unique diaries that aside from their unique traits essentially can predict the future.\
However this future can be altered by the actions of any living diary holder.\
The point of this survival game is tobe the\
          \
        last man/woman standing and the winner will succeed the current god and become a god themself.\
the best way to describe it is a 12 man battle royale version of Deathnote.\
as you can imagine this is a very smart show and the confrontations are very well done and is full of many subplots.\
Also one thing i enjoyed is the fact that even though Yuki and Yuno are the main characters everyone else is given enough spotlight that it can feel like there is no real protaganist at times and you will probaly feel for all the characters at some point.\
now i mentioned i didnt like the ending and that is because unlike the rest of the show which is well paced and while complicated it wasnt overly complicated.........yea the ending does the opposite of that.\
Trying to avoid spoilers i wont go into detail but they pull a huge amount of plot twists and overly complicated explanations that while they do explain everything leaving nothing unanswered (as far as i know) its done in such a way that the viewer is overrun with so much information that its hard to keep track of whats going on.\
honestly the ending isnt horrible its just the way its presented oh and the fact that it basicly turns into a super powered naruto-esque fight sequence.\
\
ART AND SOUND\
\
as far as the art and sound go nothing really stands out apart from the openings.\
The openings are done great but everything else isnt great but then again its not horrible either so there really isnt much to say about them.\
The character designs are good but not anything we havent really seen before.\
\
CHARACTER\
\
as i said before the main characters are yuno and yuki but everyone else could just as easily be main character potential.\
Almost everyone has a rich and fleshed out backstory and is relatable in one way or another.\
Number 4 wants to maintain justice\
Number 12 wants to make the city be remembered through the ages and number 8 just wants to take care of her family.\
Out of all the characters the two that got the most development however is uryuu (number 8) and yuki (number 1)\
uryuu goes from this cold and ruthless terrorist to this almost mentor character, while yuki.........well yuki suffers from shinji hikari syndrome.\
he starts off as a giant crybaby who cant do anything on his own but slowly (emphasis on slowly) becomes capable of taking care of himself by the end of the series.\
Then you have yuno......i know im gonna get alot of hate for this but........yuno kinda sucks.\
let me explain.\
look im a big fan of yandere characters so i tried to like yuno the poster child for yandere but she is just too much.\
most yandere have a single trigger that shifts them into yandere mode and is normal the rest of the time.\
Not yuno sadly.\
She is yandere 90% of the time however i will give this a little bit of room to work with due to the main twist at the ending making it somewhat understandable.\
my main issue is that she has no development she is just a yandere for the sake of being a yandere.\
even for yandere fans like myself there really are no redeeming qualities for her aside from the fact that she can be cute.\
\
ENJOYMENT\
despite the shows faults i still enjoyed it because it was so well written and my faults with the ending can be overlooked because its a good ending just felt kinda rushed and not needed.\
i still recommend it just be kinda open minded with the ending.",

What do you think of when you hear the words \"wasted potential\"?\
The most popular answer seems to be Sword Art Online: the story of how a decent action anime descended into the flames of Harem Hell. This is certainly true, but let's save that rant for another day.\
Today we talk about Mirai Nikki (The Future Diary)\
This is rant about of brutal betrayal and wasted imagination.\
This is a review of plot holes galore, cheaply written characters, and a shonen/seinen identity crises.\
This is the story of M&M's personal vendetta against Mirai Nikki.\

\
Story: 3/10\
\"Let's throw in all the cool things and see what sticks!\"\
This was evidently the attitude of the whoever wrote this train wreck of a plot. Sure it's cool. Sure the fight scenes are awesome. But is it good?\
No.\
There was definitely good premise here. I liked the survival game setup and the concept of the future diaries. Unfortunately, the show fails to execute its ideas.\
Mirai Nikki is a classic story of \"style over substance\". It cares far more about how \"cool\" everything is than how the plot actually works.\
Due to this, the series is chock-full of plot holes and completely illogical scenarios.\
Here are some examples:\
• A small child has perfect access to poison gas with no explanation\
• Yuno has bodies locked up in a room in her house just rotting on the floor, and the authorities never find them\
• Sloppy murders are committed in broad daylight with little to no police involvement\
I can deal with a few out-of-the-box plot events, but virtually every part of the plot is highly improbable. None of these events are impossible, but they are unlikely. (I realize that this is a fantasy series, but even fantasies should follow basic storytelling rules). There should never be random, illogical things that appear without an explanation (e.g. there are killer robot dogs that someone just \"made\").\
A lot of the worst story problems seem to stem from random, illogical decisions on the part of the characters, just for the sake of convenience. For example, people are complete unfazed when a terrorist bombs the school. If I remember correctly, Yukki's mom never even bothered check up on him about it. I mean, it would have to have been on the news at some point. It seems highly improbable that she wouldn't know or care.\
Aside from plot holes, there was another element of the storytelling that bothered me: Mirai Nikki has a seinen/shonen identity crises.\
The anime wanted so desperately to be mature and psychological, but it also tried to appeal to younger audiences with wildly misplaced humor. It is super hard to have both of those things, and Mirai Nikki failed to pull it off. It didn't have the strength to pull off the themes it wanted to.\
\
Characters: 2/10\
The characters are extremely stereotypical and I was deeply disappointed with them.\
The main character, Yukki, wasn't terrible, but he was misused. He mostly just served to whine about how crazy everything was. Yukki also does a random 180 in his attitude towards the end which did little to help my perception of him.\
Yuno, probably one of the most overrated characters in history, was simply there to be a yandere. She fits the stereotype perfectly.\
Character development was forced and, again, mostly for convenience. For example, Nine, the bad ass terrorist, is quickly reduced to the role of tsundere for the sake of simplicity.\
The supporting cast was, for the most part, terribly exaggerated. The villains were way too reminiscent of typical shonen villains: gimmicky and over-the-top. In one episode, there was a man who dressed up as a giant eyeball and hypnotized people into fighting for him, Power Rangers' style.\
Why.\
\
Art/Sound: 7/10\
This is what Mirai Nikki excels at. The op was awesome, and it's still one of my favorite ops today. The action was slick and stylized.\
Though it's far from being the goriest anime out there, it could still be a fun watch for gore fans.\
\
Enjoyment: 3/10\
Mirai Nikki is far from a masterpiece, but there are worse things out there. For this reason, Mirai Nikki receives a score of 3 (almost completely terrible, but with some redeeming qualities).\
To me, Mirai Nikki can be a fun watch if you don't think too much about it. Since I'm a nitpicker, and I HATE poor writing, my enjoyment suffered.\
Overall, if you can sit back, relax, and accept it for what it is, you'll love Mirai Nikki.\
But if you're like me and it's physically impossible to stop analyzing, you'll probably curse this heap of wasted potential forever.\

the concept is relatively unique, despite having a hunger-games-esque feel to it. but their similarities are pretty surface-level: a fight-to-the-death battle royale where only one person can emerge victorious. from there, their storylines diverge into completely different entities.\
 mirai nikki’s plot is a mess; it’s a haphazard conglomeration of elements that don’t work well together. the rape scenes were completely unnecessary, it has so many plot holes it might as well be swiss cheese, and the constant shifts in tone made it hard for me to take it seriously. ror example, in one episode, it had a happy scene that quickly escalated into a gory bloodbath. the whole scenario came from nowhere--and speaking of nowhere, nonsensical storylines and character arcs are constantly thrown into the mix, and they never end in satisfactory resolutions. worst of all, the core storyline of the show doesn’t make any sense when you look at it from another a clinical, logical perspective: prospective candidates to be the god of space and time can apparently be anyone, ranging from your eighty-year-old grandmother to a babbling five-year-old child. surely the current god could've chosen more appropriate participants? the entire process is a giant question mark that leaves room for more questions but fails to deliver answers. \
also, mirai nikki fails the romance category. it felt so contrived and forced that it was one of the most irritating aspects of the show.\
Art 5/10\
i can’t really hold the show’s animation against it; the quality is consistent, for the most part. sure, there are parts where the characters look deformed, and the animation is stilted, but that’s to be expected. \
Sound 5/10\
i’ll say, the first opening is good, as it matches the anime’s theme, but i completely skipped the second one. \
Characters 1/10\
tbh, all of the characters are two-dimensional. \
yukiteru amano is easily the worst character in the anime (the second being his father). this guy has a complete lack of redeeming qualities. sis personality remains static throughout the entire anime; he never learns from his mistakes, and every time something bad happens to him, he ends up breaking down in tears.  (SPOILER) One thing I can’t quite comprehend is the fact that yuki forgave his father for leaving him to die to save himself, and subsequently killing his mother. like, who does that? he’s selfish, and he constantly relies on Yuno instead of taking it upon himself to fix his own problems. it’s impossible not to hate him, as he spends the entire anime wallowing in self-pity. even the characters call him out for his idiotic actions, but instead of developing into a better person, he actually regresses in growth. for example, in episode 18 or 19, just when you thought he grew a backbone, it turned out that it was all scripted. the entire plan was devised by none other than yuno herself. speaking of yuno, she’s a little flat, in terms of characterization, but she is intriguing. had she been given more complexity and depth, i might have given this department a 3.\
Enjoyment 8/10\
although the show became progressively worse as the anime went on, it was pretty entertaining. mirai nikki is so pathetically terrible, that it’s almost good. however, it’s clearly not something I’d rewatch again.\

    So let me tell you about how good this show is, I literally loved every minute of Mirai Nikki. After I finished it I made everyone I know(who was willing) watch it and then I watched it again just because I could. The best thing about the anime is that it keeps you guessing and basically in suspense up until the very end and at the end after all of the suspense you cry, you cry for years. The mc is extremely annoying but that's because he isn't like usually mc's where they are heroic and ready to battle whatever comes their way, he's more\
          \
        realistic and how an actual 15 year old would react to the situation he is thrown in. Mirai Nikki is incredibly violent and gruesome at times so I wouldn't recommend it for those who are squeamish. Advice for future viewers; Please for all the is good in this world watch the OVA when you finish the show, it seriously makes the ending to the anime 10x better and not as depressing. \

    When I started watching anime i needed suggestions to get started and the first thing people said to me was Mirai Nikki/Future diary, not knowing what i was getting into I pressed ahead and started watching.\
The story of Mirai Nikki or future diary is a what if story? what if we could change the future? what if our lives were a game and what if our phones were things that kept us alive.\
Mirai Nikki forces the viewer to watch as characters compete in a survival game, the story can be a little hard to follow and you can lose track of what has happened but\
          \
        each and every episode leaves you wanting more and more while leaving you in suspense about what could happen to the main characters. but due to how intense the story can get and how easily you can lose your way I've given it a six.\
The Art of this show is a high standard and helps brings out a characters personality for example when certain scenes portray the character in a different light i.e obsessive. \
The art helps make you want to back away but all the while gripping you to ensure you will continue watching. for I've given it a ten\
The sound was not as powerful as the art but was still very good and kept you gripped until the very end of the episode, both the opening and ending themes suited the show and i have little complaints on this part. so this i have given it an eight.\
Characters, oh my those characters are unforgettable especially Yuno she has her cute side and then her yandere side, each character suits there role but at times in the story character development either didn't happen or happened to quickly. still the characters make up for the fairly written story and for that reason i've given it a nine.\
The enjoyment overall was fantastic and i never once found myself wanting to drop this show as its too good to pass up and lets be honest this show just keep making you want to watch more and more and that's why i love it. \
That combined with the characters and the art and you have a near perfect show but if you don't keep track you easily lose your way as they don't really do recaps but over all a fantastic show that i highly recommend you watch and hare and it remains one of the most known if not one of the greatest anime that i have watched.",

    I ended up watching this because of the abridged, I wish I ended up not watching this at all. This could have been a really good story, but it is completely ruined by just gore, rape and pointless nudity. \
This anime really bothered me with pointless killing, constant reusing plots in each episode. It had some good points, but I almost dropped it in episode 6 due to some very disturbing rape of a young girl, and by this I do not mean suggested rape. It literally shows her being raped by 100s of guys and it shows semen all over her legs. \
If this\
          \
        doesn't make you think about stopping the plan to watch this, it shows another rape scene later on I believe episode 16. Older than the little girl before but still in like middle school. Raped by 4 guys and it shows them screwing her too then they get murdered but still none the less stupidly disturbing. \
In the end this was so bad I cannot believe I wasted my time watching it, it is not as bad as school days, but school days did not keep you around for 26 episodes.  \

    If you like emotional, gory, violent and slightly cliche anime, get ready for a ride on the feels train. \
Story 8/10: Mirai Nikki is your typical battle royal anime where everyone else must die for one person to live. It is a well used concept, and for many, it can be boring. I, on the other hand, find that it was very well executed and the fact that they had the future telling diaries gave it an interesting twist. Oh, and it also has a romance between a crazy woman and an always crying wimp. I wish I could give the story a higher rating,\
          \
        but from the middle of the anime and so on, the story becomes very messy and it feels like the anime is trying to be better than it is. I really liked the first half, and even though I enjoyed the second half too, it was a little hard to follow and kinda fell out of the interesting concept of the first half. \
Art: 8/10: The art was at some points really beautiful, but for the most part it was quite ordinary. The character design was good looking, the backgrounds were well made and the fighting scenes were intense, but it wasn't that much to brag about. What made me give the art a high rating was the openings and endings, especially the first opening. It's one of my all time favorites, with stunning and clever animation and music. It just gives me chills. The second opening is also good, but nothing in comparison. The endings are both decent and makes you anticipate the next episode. Even if you don't plan on watching the anime after this review, watch the first opening. You will not regret it! \
Sound 9/10; To start of I have to say, at first I didn't think the score for this anime stood out too much. Then I searched for some of the music online, and I instantly changed my mind. The music for the emotional scenes i stunningly beautiful, some are really depressing and the music makes the fighting scenes so much better. The op/ed music is also really good. It really shows the emotions this anime wants to show and makes you anticipate the the next episode and what's gonna happen. \
Character 8/10: I am one of the few people who absolutely loved Yuno and her yandere personality. I found it to be interesting and kinda lovable, and I just loved how deeply she cared for Yukiteru, even to the point where she could destroy everything for him to be happy. It was both pitiable and romantic. I also really liked a lot of the diary holders, especially Minene and her awesome personality. Sadly there was one character I just couldn't stand: Yukiteru. I just hated his whiny and wimpy personality, how he was so naive and always tried to do what he thought was good and ended up failing miserably at it. Even when he tried to look cool and actually succeeded at something, I just couldn't stand him. \
Enjoyment: 9/10: I really enjoyed watching this anime. It was exciting and intense, and held on to my interest until the very end. I even ended up reading the manga. Though it had a used concept, it managed to pull it off and keep me watching. That is what defines a good anime in my opinion. \
Overall 8/10: This show definitely has some flaws, but I feel that it makes up for it with emotional interactions and intense battles. It requires some patience to watch until the end and you can't have a thing against gore and blood, but this anime puts you on the feels train and won't let you off until the end station. If you prefer happy comedies and pure romances, this is not for you. But if you like crying your eyes out because of fictional characters, this will do the trick. \

Alright, before I begin. . . if you don't like slightly messed up things. . .Well, more like very messed up . . Actually, extremely messed up, then you won't like this anime at all. I recommend you go back to whatever shoujo or shounen anime you were watching. However, if you do like that kind of messed up, common-sense defying, bloody as hell anime, then this is for you.\
- there are no spoilers, more like my personal opinion on everything. -\
-\
Story: Let me blunt- even if i gave the story a 9/10, this story has to be the most\
          \
        unique thing i've ever seen. In my opinion, the only thing that'll top this plot is Code Geass R2's. However, i gave it a 9/10 mostly because sometimes it gets confusing and i'm just like. . . . what just happened? However, i'm pretty sure if i was rating it again after i re-watched it, it would be a ten out of ten because i would understand it better.\
-\
Art: Again, 9/10. While the art is very appealing and everything is top notch perfect, that's all it is. It's in no way unique or special- there are some parts that I think are masterpieces, but to be honest, most of the art is just kind of normal. I think the art's unique side mostly comes from what is actually being drawn- like, Yuno Gasai's stalkers moments for example. Normally, she looks. . . like your average anime character. Nothing too special, nothing too plain- just normal. But then add in the yandere-ness. . . and it's suddenly amazing. You'll get it when you watch the anime.\
-\
Sound: Perfect. Ridiculously so. The OP and ED's are a perfect match and even now, I still listen to them everywhere I go and never get sick of it. (And I'm one of those people who change favorites on a weekly basis. . .) In addition, the voice actors voice everything so perfectly, and again lets use Yuno as an example. Normally, a yandere character would scare the hell out of me (not gonna stop me from watching an anime that's good, though) but Yuno. .  Yuno is my goddess. . . and her cute-sometimes-sexy voice is part of the reason why. When Yuno has her little \"moments\", the blend between cute and macho is just perfect. I'm not sure how Yuno's VA did it, but even if she did it unconciously, it was perfect. There is no character who matched their VA better then Yuno Gasai- ever. Anyway, the bgm and extra little noises were good too, but I would place them as average because that's exactly what I expect from an anime.\
-\
Character: 10/10. Yuno Gasai. End of story.\
No just kidding. ~\
The characters (besides Yuno) themselves are pretty average, actually- they're pretty popular type of characters. However, what made them that way and the little things they do because of who they are is what gives this part of the anime 10/10. In addition, the character developements with one another are splendid. (Although I did wish, somewhere deep in my heart, that Akise and Yuki ended up together, and was disappointed there wasn't any of that.) Now let's talk about Yuno again. . . . \
Yuno is splendidly different from mainstream characters. Yes, so what, she's a yandere and that's all, right? is what your probably saying. While yes, being a yandere is one of the unique things, the best part is WHY Yuno is a yandere and what made her have her occasional. . . paranoia attacks. In addition, her total character change at the end of the story (as well as Yuki's) are perfect as everything builds up perfectly, and you knew it was coming, but it still surprises you. Now before I start going on a tantrum about the ending which doesn't even belong in the \"Character\" section, NEEEEXT ~\
-\
Enjoyment/Overall : 9/10\
It was something I loved and would rewatch whenever I have nothing to do, and the characters felt like my best friends (although. . . you know, Yuno. . .)    however, while Mirai Nikki was so unparalled, rare, and plain out uncommon, i'm not really a fan of it's genres. While i love all animes, my personal preferences lean towards a veeerryy different direction then Future Diary. More like I just decided to pick up Future Diary because it was so popular, the music was catchy, I was bored, and nobody was home to listen to Yuno's insane-phases besides me. However, in the end i DID like it, but I must say i prefer the manga version.\

    Mirai Nikki is said to be a psychological trailer, however it is everything but. It fails to present a feature every psychological trailer should have and that's good character development and strong emphasis on characters emotional state, this state should also be realistically presented. This however, does not happen \
in Mirai Nikki. \
The only way it is psychological if it was a creators idea of using advanced psychology to get a reaction from the viewer and make them angry at all it's flaws, with every episode even more. If it was so, then it certainly succeeds.\
The weakest point of this anime, undoubtedly, is it's story.\
[Very\
          \
        minor spoilers to follow]\
This story was supposed to be a deadly battle for survival, where no one is safe and everyone could die at any moment. It turns what was suppose to be a survival struggle to a simple shounen series full of plot holes, characters acting irrational, and one of the worst character development I've seen.\
I have never seen such plot shields as in this anime. Every character was always miraculously saved at the last second, no matter how weak his chances for survival were.. no matter if their throat was cut, the characters always woke up and performed their final action to prolong the story, build tension, and of course, to earn the author more money with another manga volume, cause if it wasn't for that, the manga, as well as anime would have ended a lot sooner.\
And when it was time for the characters to die, they did,  usually in a very melodramatic way, being able to say their final speech.\
Their actions often contradicted their beliefs. Some key points to the story were never explained ,the actions of some characters, and even how did they manipulated their victims for example, was never explained later.\
Most notable example would be a certain diary owner, and how he manipulated people into doing his deeds by hypnosis which affected hundreds of people, and he didn't even had to look at those people or even be in a direct vicinity, quite convenient for the plot, isn't it? This subject was never even mentioned during the entirety of the anime.\
And out of all characters in the story none of them was actually serious about being a god.\
Everyone had their motives and yet they formed alliances with characters that they knew would have to die for them to win. And even when they faced their enemies and had a gun pointed to them they'd rather talk and not fire thus almost always letting them escape. And as escaping goes, characters were always avoiding death in very ridiculous ways.\
The story continues that way till the very end, with only one episode breaking the streak of the best plot armor example in any anime I watched.\
And while the previous episodes might even be considered decent by viewers not demanding realistic presentation, the last few episodes turn the genres upside down as the anime starts becoming mahou shoujo instead of the thriller it was suppose to be.\
We then have a girl who can leap for hundred meters with two people on her arms, just like she would be in zero gravity, a little creature who later turns into cannibalistic vampire while throwing magical balls that can also serve as the mini universe creator. \
We have everything BUT realism and consistent, good storytelling. The story also tries to deliberately confuse the viewer at the end so he wouldn't notice all those atrocious mistakes. And in fact for some of the viewers the anime may cause to turn their brain off a little cause of how much is going on.\
You could have a great time watching this series, If you don't concentrate on story and just have fun watching, although not believable at all, but quite entertaining survival game and maybe even laugh at some of the earlier episodes. \
And while the anime it is indeed full of holes and doesn't rationally explain anything, the ending is quite surprising. It is not a simple shounen ending. It is a surprising and very interesting ending, for the most part. Of course it doesn't explain almost anything, it simply ends a story. Although at the end there are more questions than answers.\
I personally didn't like the idea that they portrayed god in. He didn't have much power and was presented as just sitting there while he had very little to do with the world as it stayed the same place all the time. I mean if he could be god then he could create a world full of peace or completely free of money and boundaries. \
However he either didn't want to or couldn't do it which made being god completely useless and only sufficient for selfish reasons and creating world for yourself only.\
Also there's one thing that god couldn't do that absolutely i think don't qualify you as a god, cause as one you should definitely have such powers.\
The series shies away from being a strong, gory series and impose too much comedy into most of the episodes.\
So as you can read I did not enjoy it for the most part cause I was expected a deathly battle for survival and it turned out to be a full fan-service shounen unfortunately. \
Some people,whose do not demand good character development, may like it, I don't. It's a good anime, for those that likes to have fun just by looking at the bloody action, not looking to much into it's storyline. Cause when you do, you immediately notice all the mistakes and silly coincidences that makes this anime not very enjoyable.\
ART:\
Animation and background design look very good. It is noticeable that the anime used a bit of CGI for some scenes, especially the ones with Deus but it blends good and isn't very disturbing for the viewer. \
The characters design are very off however, while Yuno and Yukki are drawn very good and naturally, the rest is quite opposite.\
Other characters are sometimes just hilariously bad drawn for example eights head being so huge it almost as big as her body, and the hair of ninth makes her look ridiculous.\
And a costume for a certain character making him look more like a clown than a psycho.\
Those little things really disturb the mood that is set and it's very hard to get back into it once you pay attention to them. Those are a really noticeable things that stroked me. \
Explosions looked quite good and there are a lot of them so if you like this stuff it's going to be a treat for you. Ruined buildings and structures look pretty realistic and it's a very good compliment because realism is a thing this anime lacks the most.\
MUSIC:\
With first opening sounding amazing and lyrics reciting the names of various gods that as you can imagine ties perfectly into this anime and it was made exactly for it. Red color which is present everywhere in this anime and various gruesome scenes in the OP symbolize that it's a death struggle and it's not going to be pretty. Which wasn't entirely true. All the endings were a good pick, they are used nicely and in some episodes close the scenes with a cliffhanger very emotionally. \
The exception, however, is the second opening for the series. Both lyrically and musically it's one of the worst I've seen and it's definitely one of the worst you could pick for a series like that. Lyrics sound like someone typed some words connected with death to a translator and then randomly put them together. \
They made absolutely no sense. And while nobody watching this in Japan will probably notice, it's horrid for most people who know this language. And certainly it was for me. \
The singer also had no idea how to pronounce English words which resulted in the worst combination of vocals and lyrics I have ever seen in my life. Musically it's not that bad so I wished they just left it in instrumental if they had to use this song. Or better, not change it at all. But they didn't and I skipped it every \
single time. Such a shame.\
As for OST it's pretty good although I felt like some pieces being a little too light hearted for some scenes. But it wasn't very disturbing cause there were very creepy and fitting tracks as well, whom I later listened to with pleasure.\
CHARACTER:\
There are twelve diary owners taking part in the deadly game to become the next god.\
And most of them aren't very serious about that.\
Yukki was the worst character, or certainly the most annoying I saw in an anime. He's done nothing but complaining the whole time. Even worse, in the first episode he asks Yuno, the girl who is in love with him, to protect him to which she gladly agrees. But that wouldn't be a bad thing, and I could understand there may be such cowards like him, he didn't chose to be a part of this game, anyone would be scared. But he was not only a coward, but also a complete moron.\
He tries to form alliances with other diary owners, befriend his friends killers and\
acts like the person before him didn't just kill dozens of people \"Hey killer, let's be friends?\". \
Also he forgives his father for doing a certain thing that I know nobody would forgive anyone for, he does it in one day and expects to be great friends with him. I could understand he was very traumatized and confused by that point, but.. seriously?\
This character is a definition of stupidity. \
The way the story progresses around him is atrocious too. \
He is always protected by Yuno, and when certain event happens that makes him change by 180 degrees, it is probably the most forced and irrational change I've seen.\
In five days since certain event he now is a total bad-ass and can parachute glide, drive a car like a first class racing driver, shoot a gun so good and so accurate that he can knock out the gun from the person holding it in a way that doesn't harm them at all, he is also a great mercenary with incredible sense of danger and then jumps from a tower with a parachute without fear while holding a girl on his arms, like not frightened at all macho lover. \
Since the change, I couldn't help but laugh every time I saw him.\
Or maybe he learned it all from Yuno, who never had no experience in that matter as well?\
And speaking of the devil. Quite literally. \
If there's one reason why you definitely should watch this series that is her. \
Being the perfect example of Yandere, she drives this series with every episode showing even more of her insanity mixed with incredible cuteness that is an absolutely pleasure to watch.\
She is madly in love with Yuki and protects him  at all cost with anime strongly suggesting that there will be only two people standing alive after all this is over and makes us ask ourself what would happen then. I recommend watching this series so you could find out the answer to this question, as it will probably surprise you, maybe not in a good way, but it's always better than predictable ending, or is it? \
By the end we also find maybe the most interesting and unpredictable thing about Yuno that really makes you want to stay with this anime till the very end. \
It was the only thing that made me watch the whole of this anime.\
But, as Yuno is the only character worth watching, the rest is a disaster cast.\
Example of others 'very clever' characters include:\
There is one guy who gets dressed in the strangest outfit possible who makes him blind and surprisingly he is able to hypnotize people without any explanation of how he does that, until he gets killed in most anticlimactic way possible.\
There's a four year old who is a professional killer, of course, and the mastermind, whose tactics are outsmarting every owner out there. For example, he mails himself his diary so that the others would find out and take it from him, but if you open it from the outside it surprisingly releases an incredibly dense gas enough to fill a whole house even though this gas is released from a tiny envelope. It doesn't flow out even though the door is open, oh no, It spreads throughout the whole house making it deadly to breathe. \
He is the master of disguise trying to make his kills look like accidents. And he is of course a four year old trained to kill since the day he could walk by his father Joker (NOT!). \
And that what characters look like in Mirai Nikki, it looks incredibly stupid and you just want to laugh seeing all of them.\
And there is a woman whose head is twice as big as her body, It seems there are no limitation as to the stupidity and irrational behavior but there are no limits as to the characters ridiculous designs as well as some didn't even look like humans.\
There is also a lovers couple who once they meet with Yukki and Yuno triying to kill them by proving their love is stronger. And when they defeat them both and they are unconscious, the prove they are not serious about becoming a god at all and leave them alive, so you could ask why did they follow them all the way to this point just to leave them alive. Well, I have no idea. Perhaps to make more money for the author by prolonging the story yet again?\
And of course there is Deus, the god, whose powers are very, very limited. Well, apparently he is able to pick out his successor cause he is not an almighty god and can do almost nothing a god should be able to and is dying, as god should of course.\
There is a little creature Mur Mur, whom we later find out it some sort of demon, or a vampire, who has much greater power than Deus. She can create her own world within a small sphere and put people in it, which Deus cannot.\
Also Deus were in talk with all of the diary owners before the game and one of them even designed the diaries himself. You would've thought that would be slightly unfair, to let the creator of one thing participate in the game, he could for example know of some hidden features that others don't, Deus didn't think so however and he agreed, he also gave him the best diary in the game.\
No one was really serious about becoming a god, characters were forming alliances knowing that they would have to kill each other at the end, and some were just idiots talking so long that they let opponents escape, and some even missed from 2 meters having characters at gunpoint and so on...\
Characters are the weakest point of this anime and this should be an example of how to not create a characters personality. There is only one exception, that being Yuno, but she however is not that experienced as well and yet her knife skills are phenomenal. She makes up for it with her cuteness though so it's hard to notice that for the most part. Shame that the rest of the characters are awful. \
Enjoyment:\
It is a horrible shounen and should be treated like one. Do not expect realism or good character development, but if you don't pay attention to this and you just want to watch a blood bath then you will definitely have good fun. \
I didn't enjoy this for the reasons stated above.\
Overall:\
Mirai Nikki is not a good anime, it tries to make you believe it is, but when you start noticing all the plot holes, all the inconsistencies, all the characters irrational actions and so on you cannot unsee the mistakes in every single episode, and they get bigger and bigger in the end. It is not realistic and believable and can only be enjoyed by turning off your mind and watch characters kill each other without thinking about why they do it.\
I couldn't enjoy it and never will. 3/10\

    First of all, let me start by giving you the biggest advice of all, putting aside this review, do not listen to any reviews unless they are POSITIVE. Reviews are usually written by people who have a very judgemental personallity and people like that hate things that make people scream out of joy.\
Before i started watching Mirai Nikki i read a few negative reviews about it and appearantly, the details of the review were totally right.\
However, the conclusion was absolutely wrong, i admit that mirai nikki doesn't do a very good job at what it was meant to be, mirai nikki is not a good\
          \
        thriller or a psychological drama (except for Yuno who is one of the most interesting characters in the history of anime), and appearantly that's the reason of all the bitching.\
Ok so let's actually start this review.\
Story - A- : \
The main idea of Mirai nikki is good, it really is, but appearantly this is not what this anime revolves around, the anime's main source of interest is the relationship of Yuki and Yuno, the two main characters of the show.\
While being a little reinforced by their surroundings, you'll find out at the end of this anime that the only characters that you really care for are those two, and if you ask me it's totally fine.\
Characters -  B - :\
Some characters in Mirai nikki are very generic and meaningless, but atleast they don't harm the story, a few characters are well thought of and developed and those are the ones that you are likely to remember.\
First of all, we have Yuki and Yuno, which are clearly the most interesting couple i've ever seen in an anime ( Maybe except Kirito and Asuna ).\
Yuki is an amazingly well developed character who goes through a logical and major change through the show, you may not really like him at the beginning, but after a while he just does what he has to do and turns the entire show upside down. Then we have Yuno, she is absolutely the main trigger of this show to exist to begin with, she doesn't go through alot of development but that's cause she's already figured out, and you'll find out why later on.\
Second of all, we have Yuki's friends, Hinata, some random uninteresting girl, some stupid goofball who keeps making fun of himself and Neon genesis evangelion's tribute.. Akise aru, the mysterious detective guy that you suspect throughout the entire show, sorry for not saying anything about the other characters but Akise is the only one i feel is worth talking about, this character gets little screentime but every time he pops on the screen you're being reminded of why this show is so interesting in the first place, he's the one who's thinking outside of the box and asks himself questions that nobody else has thought asking.\
\
Now, i wanna review something that nobody else reviews and that would be:\
Attachment to the characters A+ :\
This is something that absolutely doesn't apply to everyone, but if it does apply to you, you're in luck, because you've won a great prize, this show offers the best of the best to people who have a high enough EQ to attach to the characters ( Most people obviously do ), ofcourse i'm only talking about Yuki and Yuno..\
You'll find yourself sitting with a blank look on your face, thinking why they are not real when you're finished because they just make the most interesting couple ever written in anime history, and that's because they're so unusual.\
Animation - A :\
I don't have much to say about the animation of this anime, it's really good in my opinion, if you don't particularly like this kind of animation then it will just do what it's supposed to do.\
Music B- :\
Not too much to say about the music either... the soundtrack is really forgetable but the opening and ending themes are just classy and cool, especailly the first one ( My opinion ).\
Overall B :\
I really wanna give it an A+.. i really do.. and that's because that's why i specificly feel about this anime, i've been through a short but amazing ride while watching this show but unfortunately what i like doesn't apply to anyone, everything else i said is pretty much objective so don't worry, just give it a chance ( It gets better after a while, the beginning is not as good, it still is, just not as good, and the rest of the show is amazingly well thought of )\
Strong points :\
Plot twists\
Character development ( To some characters )\
Mystery\

    First of all, if you dont like any gore and bloody scenes you better find another anime, because this anime is not for you. Just find any ecchi anime or another H anime.\
and another things, i really bad with the words, so i didnt think it would present how i love this anime was. \
Ok, lets begin the review. \
Story 9/10\
The story involves about a boy, his name is Yuki. He is a bystander, and always write something that happen to him in his diary. and his life changed when his \"imaginary friends\" Deus ex Machina calling him for playing \"games\" or we can call\
          \
        it survival game, the person who last standing will be a god of time and space. and not just that, his phone diary become a future diary which can tells him what happen in the future, and his adventure began more complicated when a girl named Gasai Yuno appears and helped him.\
For me, this story is incredibly amazing, you will have a lot of twist that makes you think \"Oh, i dont know it would be happen\". and since this story focuses on Yuki and Yuno, you will see the development between two of them, from wimp into a real man, and what i love from this show is the weird romance between two of them, a tsundere girl and a wimp man. its truly interesting. and i must say, the \"twist\"  and \"weird romance\" in this show are the strong points.\
\
Art 10/10\
Again, i must say. Fabolous, beautiful, gorgeus, and epic. that what can i said. the artwork in this anime is suprisingly amazing. From the character into the environment is absolutely beautiful. Especially the character, the character in this anime is so well made, i cant help myself to love the female character in this anime especially Yuno. lol\
Sound 10/10\
All of the opening songs and the ending is truly remarkable, well, i really really love the opening and the ending even i buy the soundtracks! i just love this OST, it gives you thrilling and  it goes well with the anime. and really perfectly fits with the story. and if you had finished watching this, i think you will know the meaning for this opening (when there is Yuno killing herself). oh and seiyuu itself, really doing well. it goes along with each character.\
Character 10/10\
Here are the strongest point of this anime, the character. the MC alias Yuki, is truly a wimp. he will easily scared. for me, this actually what we call REAL. there is absolutely no one except psychopath who didnt scare when seeing someone died in front of him or bombs ? he is still 14 years old ! i think i am gonna scared too if that happen to me. and for Yuno, i think she is perfectly fine. with the tsundere role.  pretty but suprisingly dangerous. and for other characters, they are so many characteristic characters appears, like police, terrorist, even government. its truly fascinating.\
Overall 10/10\
I really enjoyed this anime so much. unique story and the thriling are so real. i couldnt have any words to describe how epic this anime was. you should watching this anime especially when you're looking for an anime that makes you mindblown. \

    Now I've managed to drag myself from the hilarity that is the Yuki Yuki Yuki video I can review it..\
The story works in such an enthralling way you continually seem to think you have it all sussed only to have your ideas repeatadly blown apart - this is what kept me watching for sure. The characters aid this, and the exitment of knowing some of them without having disocoverd them yet. Seemingly very creative concepts and plently of fleshed out characters giving much life to the anime.\
The music for the original intro/outro was especially top notch, wasn't such a fan for the change later on\
          \
        but by then I suppose I was too busy being traumatised by the plot.\
In terms of art, all nice and dandy, the 3Dish moments I never really got used to and didn't seem quite to fit, though I understood the reasoning behind it in terms of generating etheral or otherworldy subjects.\
Definitely would and have recomended to a friend, you know a series is good when you feel empty afterwards and require to watch as many additional videos about it straight after as you can.\

    For me, I started watching this Anime because the summary intrigued me. And all I can say is that after the first episode, I was \"hooked\".  I actually started reading and finished the manga a couple nights later.\
The story is fairly unique for me in that there are no other anime's that come to mind that uses a game based on forms of \"diaries\".  \
The art is extremely well done and I feel it really helps bring the story to life.\
The Opening and Endings are also very well done with songs that complement to the theme of the anime.\
As for characters, I really\
          \
        like how they develop the characters in the animation and excellent voice acting.\
Overall, I feel this anime really does the manga Justice.  It brings the story to life and all the elements from the animationto voice acting to OP and ED, etc really help make this anime stand out from others. \

    Future Diary...\
A number of people recommended this show to me, saying that it was some kind of masterpiece. Although I can vaguely see the appeal others may have, here I am to try and prove you wrong. Future Diary is very interesting in concept that falls flat on it's face in terms of story and characters.\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
Story:\
Although we have seen Battle Royale types of shows come out in all types of media beforehand, Mirai Nikki brought on a fairly unique take on the genre. That, however, is the only real praise the show gets in term of story. The writers basically made the show into a\
          \
        gory mess, trying to appeal to people who enjoy that kind of stuff. *MINOR SPOILER* For example, you have this 5 year old kid who is apparently taught himself to be some kind of killing genius and can get a hold of poison gas.*MINOR SPOILER END* They litter stuff like this to make the show more flashy than it actually is, which is a major dissapointment in my opinion. Also, like a lot of thriller shows, plot twists are thrown in to make things more dramatic. In this case, however, more is actually less. The plot twists are sloppy at best, and if you inspect them closely, you can see how flawed they are. While I won't spoil you on anything, around the 20th episode, this becomes blatantly evident. This anime just throws in so much random bullshit by the end of it that makes it so confusing that they try to hide the massive plot holes they have created.\
 The ending also wasn't much, as it was more or less entirely predictable. In the end, Mirai Nikki was a beautiful premise that failed with, to be blunt, sloppy writing.\
*MOAR SPOILERS* One more thing about the story. We have this mess of a romance between Yuki and Yuno. I understand where Yuno was coming from as Yuki gave her a purpose to live, even though that purpose itself was flawed. Yuno never really listens to Yuki or what he wants, and just acts on her own desires. Like, she ties him up midway through the series and keeps him hostage for a short while. Yet, Yuki still, after all the shit she pulls, loves her. I swear the romance is written by a bunch of 2 year olds, but I digress. *END OF MOAR SPOILERS*\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
Characters:\
If you thought the story was bad, take a gander at the characters of this series. I just couldn't stop shaking my head at the terrible mistakes and lack of backstory they got.\
First off, we have Yukiteru. He starts off as a complete coward, scared for his life and not knowing what to do. Because of this, I sympathized with his character for a short while as it added a sense of realism to him. But for half of the series, he just whines and cries about his shitty life, even though nothing really bad has happened to him. Also, when talking about character development, Yukiteru is an example of character development done COMPLETELY WRONG. There are moments where it seems he is finally trying to break out of his spineless cocoon, just to crawl back into it by the beginning of the next story arc. He does, however, start to completely change during the second half. This is also flawed as he changes from spineless wuss into ruthless killing machine over the course of 2 seconds. \
Now, we have Yuno, the yandere for this series. She is basically put into this series to act as the resident badass who Yuki uses as his killing machine until about the halfway point. It was very refreshing to actually see a girl with a backbone, rather than having a useless girl who relies on her damn boyfriend to do anything useful. Still, the dedication that Yuno gives for this crybaby never failed from continuously angering me. I don't see why she has this undying dedication to Yuki, as he really isn't worth stalking in the slightest. \
We are introduced to a vast array of characters, ranging from Yuki's classmates to the other diary owners and so on and so forth. However, none of them except for maybe one or two get any development at all. Some get a minutes worth of backstory, but in the end, it doesn't really help. This is just me, but when someone died, I really didn't feel any emotion towards them, as it just felt like their death was just convenient for the plot to move along. Of course, there is one ray of light known as Akise. He is undeniably my favourite of the series, as he probably gets more development than the main character himself. He doesn't even have a diary, yet hes more useful than him.\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
Animation:\
The animation was good, nothing spectacular, yet nothing that burns the eyes. Some scenes have a sense of style and fluidity which was a pleasure to watch, but some were just really flawed and very static. Also, special mention to the character designs for making the most laugh-inducing characters I have seen in a long time. Like, we have a girl version of the Pillsbury Doughboy. Why the hell...\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
Sound:\
Let's start off with a good note. The opening. Fast paced, great animation, fits the show well enough. Let's just say I loved the heck out of it. The second one wasn't as great, but it was still enjoyable to say the least. The soundtrack used for the actual show wasn't really anything special, but my eardrums are still intact, so that's a plus in my books. I did have a problem with the sound effects, however, as some did seem out of place, and didn't really fit with some of the actual scenes. In the topic of dub vs sub, sub is definetely the way to go. For someone as whiny as Yuki, you have a relatively deep voice portraying his character, which was terribly miscast. This is also a problem with Yuno's engrish voice actor, for basically the same reasons.\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
As much as I wanted to enjoy this series, there was just so much wrong with it that I just ended up shaking my head for the whole ride, just waiting for the train to come to a crashing hault. The story has so many plot holes you could fly a plane through it, the characters either had no development at all, or, in Yuki's case, had too much of it. Also, the decisions each of the characters made where unrealistic and not very interesting in the slightest. There were some high points in the Sound and Animation departments, but nothing to really bring the show out of the rubble that it caused. Although, I know a lot of people will disagree with me, so even though I don't recommend it really at all, feel free to check it out as you might find something to you're liking.",

    I was recommended this series a few years ago when I started watching anime, so it's always been floating in my subconscious to watch and experience. Part of me avoided it for some time, but in an attempt to understand the many jokes that result from this series, I decided to give it a shot.\
I must remember that sometimes instincts are definitely something I should follow more often than not.\
Did I enjoy this series? Partially. It had some enjoyable moments, or else I wouldn't have been able to complete it; however, this series was in an array of absurdity. The character motivations are askew and\
          \
        often uninteresting, sometimes they barely make sense and are just there to serve the plot. For a thriller or psychological idea with this kind of weight, I feel like there could've been much done there, but Mirai Nikki just serves as a joy ride, so it wasn't satisfying. It didn't leave me fulfilled to have watched it, and was all the colour without the lines. It tries to be a lot without having very basic story structure. Some parts were fun, but the feelings of confusion that arose from almost anything that happened overwhelmed that.\
Something that irked me more than the ridiculousness of the plot twists and such, is that there's no weight to a character's choices. When there is consequences they are easily excused, and I feel this is because of lazy screenwriting, which I found a little insulting only because the premise of the series had so much promise. If there were a more reasonable weight to the consequences of a particular choice a character has made, this would've made me appreciate the psychological aspect of the characters more, and I would've had more empathy for them. When by the last few episodes they try to rush all the weight of some of that, of which should've been built throughout the series, I couldn't help but laugh in bouts at literally every time the main characters got emotional and sentimental. I could not take the series seriously. You can't just have 26 episodes, just hint at some things in a main character's story to me, and then just throw it all in at the last 5-6 and expect me to get past all the things they've done before and make me care about them, especially coupled with the weirdest plot twist I've come to experience in something for quite some time.\
Was the series predictable? Yes. \
Was the plot twist expected? No, and the reason for that is, yes, they didn't really hint towards that being a possibility before, but it felt more like an excuse to make something else happen to just throw in there just... because.\
I'm also very critical of Yuno and Yukki's relationship. Obviously it is not a healthy one, but the reason why I feel so critical of it is because it lacked sincere clarity, and consistency. In fact, nothing about this series is very consistent at all. Characters will make sudden choices just to move the plot forward, no matter how stupid and unfitting it may seem for them. I really couldn't care less what happened to them. I was just witnessing all hell break loose with absolutely no empathy towards the possible results.\
The plot holes, at first, were excusable, but it just goes into a down spiral. It feels as if this series didn't have any qualms to make a great impact, though it wanted to. Even the fight scenes didn't impact superbly. There's just lots of messed up things happening for show, and nothing to fall back on. \
It was completely and utterly disappointing, and I don't think I've felt so mad about a series before. There were perhaps 1-2 characters I actually felt a connection with, of which I would've loved more story behind, but dreams are for free. \

    I want to say... 'Jack of all genres, master of none.'\
What. The. Eff.\
I'll keep this review short and (not-so) sweet.\
I'll start with the positive though. The concept is clever and although elements of it have been done before, I feel it did bring something new-ish to the table. I didn't pick the twist until it was almost staring me in the face, but I liked the fact that even though the clues were there, it wasn't bang-on obvious. I felt I had to endure the first 18 episodes to get to the good stuff though.\
Animation and sound is solid too.\
Ok, so if you like your\
          \
        characters at the opposite ends of the emotional spectrum, then this is for you. And the females, oh the females in this were portrayed horribly. There was hardly any normality. It was either back the psychos or the tragics. Not a fan at all of how they were shown and the men weren't that crash-hot either. The relationship between the two mains is also quite cringeworthy, right up until the last few episodes I reckon. Plus if I have to hear 'Pookie' again, I'll scream.\
Unfortunately I think the other main drawback for this series was that it tried too hard to fit a bit of everything in. Romance, comedy, both yaoi and yuri connotations, horror, drama, action, supernatural... It's too much for one series. However, when the action gets going (especially when they pit their diary's unique abilities against each other) it becomes pretty decent to watch.\
So for concept, animation and gore... give Mirai Nikki a go. But if you want characters, consistency and something solid to watch... find something else.",

    Future Diary... Well... This anime is very popular for what I think is the wrong reason. If someone told you to watch it, their reasoning for saying so is because they most likely love the character Yuno Gasai. In my opinion, she was a biatch who was obsessed with this one guy.\
The story was pretty good. Kind of reminded me of The Hunger Games because... It was basically the same thing except you're God if you win.  I found this concept to be interesting seeing as to the fact that I never got why anyone would want to be God. (8/10)\
The art is something\

        that I really did like about this show. Just... the way the hair was drawn and the eyes... made it really enjoyable experience. And the way that the blood was drawn... That was very nice. (10/10)\
The sound was great to. I for one, watched it in Japanese, and I think the voice actors were very fitting. The music well... I really did like the track this show had to offer. The sad track was very pretty and I often find myself listening to it. (9/10)\
The characters were overall, very interesting. Although I don't get why people would ever like her, Yuno was an interesting character. She is quite... well, insane but for good reason. There were lots of characters, all of them creepy in their own special way. (10/10)\
My enjoyment of this show was.... Very good. It had a good amount of gore, sadness, and even it's share of romance. (8/10)\
Overall I would rate this show as very good. The whole idea of the show got me thinking how far I would go for someone else.\

    I find the best animes are the ones where you want to see how it ends but you really dont want to see it end. This is the feeling i had through out Mirai Nikki. I was excited for the ending but was crushed that such a great show had to end. This review is not meant to spoil any of the story and its purpose is to only convince you to watch this show.\
I've seen more than my fair share of bad reviews on Mirai Nikki and they bring up a lot of good points. It has more than its fair share of plot\
          \
        holes, characters do unexpected things that seem to happen unexplained and possibly out of order. But i believe if you look past all these plot holes you get a great show, love story (Sort of) and an amazing character in Yuno. Some endings seem forced but despite all that i fricken loved this show. I loved the story of Yuno and Yukki and i even love all the little thing about the other characters. Sometimes it feels like Yuno is carrying this show on her back but thats okay considering she is one of the most unique characters i have seen in anime and may go down as one of my favorite anime characters of all time.\
This show kept drawing me back in with insane plot twists and i just needed to know what would happen next and most of all what would happen with our main characters relationship. Yes, this anime is full of plot holes but despite all that this was one of the most enjoyable rides i had and i certainly wont forget it. TBH i wish there could be more but there isnt very much else to do with this show. I highly recommend giving Mirai Nikki a try and just forget about whats wrong and focus what is great about this story.\

    Mirai Nikki is kind of amazing. Not because it's good, but because it it does so much wrong all at once that it baffles me. Typically, bad or subpar anime only indulge in a few major \"anime tropes\" at a time. Even my ultimate nemesis Sword Art Online (which I still think was a worse experience than this one) does not throw as much shit into its story. Meanwhile, Mirai Nikki seems to have every anime trope in the book, and that too, bad ones. Cliche ones. Embarrassing ones that make anime fans go \"but wait, anime is not just porn!\" Mirai Nikki goes above\
          \
        and beyond by having them all. It's an exercise in stupidity. A cacophony of nonsense.\
For that reason alone, I'd say it's worth one (just a single) watch. Lessons can be learned from this shitshow of a trainwreck. You could call Mirai Nikki \"How Not to Make a Good Anime\" because this is one the medium's low points. And yet, this has over an 8 on MAL, is #9 of the most popular anime, and Yuno Gasai is the #1 most favorited female character of all time. Well... there's no accounting for taste. Also, I think my mindset before going into this anime really helped. I knew or at least suspected it was going to be terrible, so my expectations didn't let me down. I don't think I quite consider it a \"so bad it's good\" thing because there's a distinct lack of charm or appeal for me, but it wasn't totally unwatchable either. Aside from a few filler episodes, the pacing is very fast, so I didn't start getting bored until the end. There were some moments that were unintentionally hilarious too, so at least I got a laugh out of it sometimes. I'm sure it would've been really frustrating if I came into it thinking it'd be decent or good, but thankfully I didn't.\
Normally at this point in the review, I would be rambling and nitpicking every little thing that bothered me about the anime, but what do I say when literally almost everything is bad? Frankly, I don't even want to go back and think about it anymore than I already have. In fact, it's actually easier if I just named the few things I liked: 1] there's a few voice actors I happen to really like (Akira Ishida, Norio Wakamoto, Tomokazu Seki, Takehito Koyasu), and 2] Aru Akise is pretty much the only decently written and likable character of the cast. That's it. Honestly, I saw this anime because I can't help but watch the really popular stuff to see what the fuss is about. Now that I've ticked it off, I'm officially done. This review is me metaphorically washing my hands of it. \
(You know, if the author really wanted to make a story with jiggly boobs, the gang rape of teen girls, and 14 year olds having sex, he could've just made a hentai. I would've respected that far more, just saying.)\

    Whew, Mirai Nikki. One of the most controversial anime series to ever air: some hate it with a passion whilst some praise it as a masterpiece. It creates a definition for the terms \"yandere\" and \"overly attached girlfriend\" and taught me a new meaning of love. For me, it was a roller coaster ride of a lifetime with so many twists and turns that never bored me for a second and believe me, that is a feat indeed. I believe Mirai Nikki is something worth checking out no matter what genre you like and honestly, if you don't like it you don't have to see\
          \
        it another episode. Ever.\
Story: If you are interested in a long, suspenseful thriller then Mirai Nikki is for you. The story is a great ride through a fictional town with various places including schools, hospitals and towers being explored. Each story arc tells the struggle of one of the minor characters, their background and their reason to fight and ultimately become God. I have learnt many things about being human watching this series and hope you can too. And who can forget that ending? Countless have shed tears watching that. BUT, one of the main reasons this show is hated by many is because there are many plot holes. Sometimes you may find yourself asking \"wait, how exactly did that happen?\" or \"why would this thing do that?\" but ultimately, at the end of the day it is your choice as to whether you let these plot holes obliterate your enjoyment of this anime or whether you choose to ignore them as I did and enjoy it anyways.\
Art: This anime aired in the 2010's, therefore the animation quality is of course going to be good. However, if you are only looking for good animation, then I don't recommend this series as there are better ones, such as Guilty Crown. However, I do believe the team did a very good job with the animation in terms of the quality of the explosions, crumbling towers and various other special effects. I also like the design of many of the characters, namely the two female protagonists and Deus Ex Machina (who is a character). \
Sound: The BGM in this anime really help to convey the mood of the scenes, especially the \"horror vibe\" which is what the series is supposed to do, among others such as a romantic one. My favourite OST by far is \"Here with you\", which is probably one of the most emotional and beautiful soundtracks you can get out there, which plays during emotional scenes between the male and female protagonists. It functions as my lullaby, study music, relaxation music...ok sorry I'm going off topic now. But you get the idea: it is good. OP 1 is also very good, though I am not a big fan of Japanese singing in English, hence not really OP 2, but both ED's are sugoi, especially 2 which really shows the pain of the female protagonist.\
Character: Mirai Nikki has a very good set of characters. The cast are a generally likeable bunch, and of course the seiyu of the female protagonist did a very good job voicing her with that high-pitched voice (I do not recommend dub) and rampage voice. the minor characters all get a share of the development, as each of their backstories, their personalities are all told as well as their reasons for fighting. And my favourite part is that they are not all souless, heartless killers: they act like their personalities. And of course who can forget the Yandere queen herself: as stated she gave me a new definition of love and clingy.\
Overall, I highly recommend this anime to you guys. If you don't like it then you don't have to keep watching, but like I said there is so much in this anime that you will be missing out on. \

    This is my first review in MAL....since im new here...i'll just try this out...so please correct my mistakes as i make them....will be much appriciated.\
Okay....my first impression on the first episode on the anime was...well after watching anime's for these past two years...i could describe it as....Mysterious?? Of course i have seen more mysterious anime's like Bakemonogatari,Mekakucity Actors etc. So here's my review for Mirai Nikki (TV).\
Story (9/10): Ok i reaalllyy like these anime's that have the Genre: Action,Mystery,Horror,Thriller types...so much that i even watch a whole anime in one day. :D and the first episode till episode 7 got me HOOKED!! I was like:\
          \
        OMG Another another!! XD. A Bystander Teenage boy who doesn't interact wwith many people. And is always writing in his what we may call \"Diary\" which my curiosity mode switch got flipped on. So to describe the story for me its a 9. \
Art (7/10): The art in this show is quite normal in my sight..because i really don't understand true \"Art\" yet in anime. But if i had to describe it....for example the eyes and hair...are a bit way out of line sometimes?? Like the eyes are far away from their original position? Meh...well it still got me excited every episode anyway :D so....7.\
Sound (8/10): Ok...the sound in this anime is BADASS...really like it!! It fits the situation perfectly..! Heart Racing Scenes,Heart Warming Scenes. Even the OP and ED Song are good!! I like it very much so....8.\
Character (8/10): Hmm...this is one of my \"Most Important Part of the review\" comes...i really..really....really!!! Hate the MC in this show...he acts like a wimp and like a girl!! (even if he does get badass later on) i still hate his first impressions he had on me..so why did my score in this one still got a 8/10?? Because of the Female Protagonist..The most weridest and Psychotic lover and stalker you will ever have! XD. So she made up for the MC's stupid actions. So therefore 8/10.\
Enjoyment (8/10): What can i say?? This show really thrills me a lot!! A lot of suspense and intensity and curiosity! You will really get hooked on it :P....so here it is!! 8..!!\
Overall(9/10): Overall this review summarizes up my \"Own Opinion\" so the other's who dislike my review please don't hate me for it :( newbie in MAL even though i already watched anime for 2 years....well of course the anime itself captivates me with different aspects and genres that i will be left confused..which is what i expect from these genres >:D. So overall it's a 9/10 for me!\
Thank you for taking your time on a newbie such as me on reading my review for Mirai Nikki (TV) ;) Good day all\

    Editied for up to Episode 12:\
There have been a couple spots of relativly lower quality animation scattered in what has otherwise been very good qualty video. - 8\
The soundtrack, while it can seem a bit, well lazy at parts throughout the course of the show, still managed to boast both the best OP and ED of the season, from what I watched.The voice actors/actresses all seem to match up with their designated roles, although I may have liked to have heard someone else play the role of Yukki - 8\
In terms of characters, well everyone (at least to my knowledge) watches it for Yuno so\
          \
        its actually more practical to talk about the other characters.\
Yukki really dips between points of being annoying and points where I can appreciate his struggle and how he overcomes obstacles. But the true character strength in this show seems to come from the other diary holders, each of whom brings something new and diverse to the scene, not just with their external character traits, but their back stories and especially their personal diaries. - 10\
The story overall was the first of the genre that I had picked up, so at least for me it was unique and intriguing, although I'm aware some may find certain aspects of it over emphasized by the creators and over-hyped by the fans. Overall the fluidity of the narrative combined with great character interaction with limited, yet useful anime-only fillers, is well thought out and well executed. - 9\
Personally I found it to be my favorite show of the season, closely followed by Fate/zero and assuming it continues the way it is now It will be a show to watch whether you are just picking up or waiting for the end to marathon. Overall Mirai Nikki scores a 9/10\

    Future Diary/Mirai Nikki is a well written novel-like story.\
Future Diary was a suprisingly awesome anime/manga (I watched the anime only). I wasn't so sure about it at first because I thought it was going to be another bloodbath without enough story to justify the bloodshed that was happening/going to happen but I was wrong.\
What if you could look into the future just by looking at the screen of your cell? Sounds awesome, right? Well what if I told you that several others also had the same ability but you have to kill each other or else the world will end and whoever is the last\
          \
        person standing becomes god of time and space? Shit just got serious now!\
Future Diary is an anime I would've dropped by the end of the 2nd or 3rd episode but I was forced into watching it because of the damned anime recommendation circle I'm part of but I'm glad I finished this anime because it was worth sitting through the whole series. To be honest, the realizationg of how good this anime is didn't hit me until about halfway through and Future Diary definitely earned the right to carry the genre name of suspense. This anime had me sitting on the edge of my seat wishing I had popcorn to snack on while watching this psychotic masterpiece. \
Future Diary started a bit slow for me but it's not so much that it's a slow paced anime, oh no, that's definitely not the case, it's just that murder action suspense isn't my cup of tea but the character writing was way better than I initially thought and the anime grew on me.\
Our MC in Future Diary is a middle school student named Yuki Amano. Yuki is a loner (and a total wimp too), he records his daily events like a diary in his cell, he also has 2 imaginary friends; Deus Ex Machina the God of Time and Space!, and there's Murmur (assistant of Deus Ex Machina the God of Time and Space). One day Yuki learns that his diary recordings are showing events that are yet to happen and end up coming true. This brings Yuki discomfort and he learns that he is a player in a survival game where all players must kill each other in order to take Deus Ex Machina's place as god of time and space because he's slowly deteriorating.  Yuki (also known as 1st) ends up teaming up with Yuno Gasai (aka 2nd) who is an obvious psychopath from day 1 but she is madly in love with Yuki which causes her to go to extreme lengths to protect the love of her life.\
I didn't really like Yuki all that much because he's incredibly wimpy and weak-willed (especially in the stting in which he is placed) however, at a certain point in the story he becomes more confident, badass, likeable, and a character I could root for. Yuno stays psychotic til the ending but over the course of this 26 episode+OVA we learn more and more about our heroine of this story. Yuno Gasai is the most psychotic yandere character in anime I've ever seen but I just couldn't bring myself to hate her (especially after learning why she's the way she is). Honestly I couldn't care less about the characters who weren't chosen as candidates/players. They just weren't interesting enough for me to care about them, the psychopaths were waaay more interesting like the terrorist, the cop, the child, the mayor, and everyone's favorite, Yuno (the MC's love interest).\
The story of Future Diary has this brilliant formula that makes an excellent suspense story; plot mixed wth confusion -> problem -> answer to problem in next episode -> new problem -> answer to problem in next episode -> slight explanation -> new problem -> answer to new problem in next episode -> more explanation -> new problem -> answer to problem in next episode -> rinse and repeat. \
The animation is good and it really captures the psychotic looks in the characters eyes.\
After the end of each episode there are mini episodes attached on about Murmur's silly adventures and her interactions with certain characters in the series.\
I shall not spoil the ending but I will say it has a depressing turn that I couldn't help but compare it to Serial Experiments Lain's ending but with a love plot attached. After the credits of the 26th and final episode, there's hope!\
That scene after the credits of the last episode is explained through an OVA that I imagine many people would call the true ending.\
This was an epic anime with plenty of unexpected twists and turns and would recommend it to anyone who likes suspense, mystery, violence, character development, psychotic romance, and thick plot. \
So if you're interested, PLEASE GIVE IT A SHOT!",

    Mirai Nikki is one of my favorite manga. the excitement, the thrill, the pyschological factor and that memorable romance was something i thought could not be duplicated. I remember what i said in my head when it was green lit for an anime adaptation :\" this is gonna be good\"....what i didn't know was it was actually going to be awesome. The beginning of this review is going to make me look like an ass-kisser but there are some very small downsides. \
story- wow....if more words are needed to convince you then i shall continue. We have such a thrilling situation where the concept of\
          \
        \"survival of the fittest\" comes into place with the reward to be god. Although i have only watched 3 episodes at the time of this review i can say that the feeling i had when reading the manga is coming back in a more visual form. The twists and \"oh damn\" moments are as lively as ever and leaves you wanting more and more (kinda similar to Deadman Wonderland). I suggest this plot for people who want to spice up their anime list and want something new and original to the plate. \
art- the art is consistent and has great quality. i can't really say that the art is jaw dropping but its clear, beautiful and fits the atmosphere almost perfectly. this is a typical present day anime quality art basically but with more consistency. \
sound- Quality is perfect. There are no akward sounds, and if there is then its nearly impossible to spot. The many situations are accompanied with clear cut sounds and the background music slips in to make the situation more intense or emotional. But to be truthfull all sounds seem to sound the same to me so your taste would most likely be more critical. Also if we are talking about OP and ED then they are great especially the ED imo. unfortunately i am not too familiar with Faylan and Yousei Teikoku. However i have heard them sing in1 or 2 animes i have previously viewed but their impact was not enough for me to remember the name. \
character- here we go. \
1. Yukiteru Amano is a boy who seems to prefer being a side character. At first he appears to be a typical highschooler excluding the fact his hobby of recording things on his phone. thats just sounds painfully boring. He is a more exciting person then you would expect at first....well he better be because he's the main character. Yuki's thinking is quick and filled with overflowing emotions in pressuring times. This is a really intresting point about him that i think you will also enjoy. BTW when i say overflowing emotions i don't mean it has to seem like he has some disorder or an insane case of ADHD. \
Yuno Gasai- YANDERE. by far the most eccentric, bloodthirsty, and intresting character in Mirai Nikki. You will never see another character with Yuno's traits. She has a rather akward and scary crush on Yukiteru which fuels the pychological factor but also puts an new twist in the romance genre. Yes there is some romance but don't expect it to be generic. \
-enjoyment- Yes you will enjoy this. I wouldn't recommend this to everyone but if ur looking for a lil adrenaline then go ahead and watch Mirai Nikki because it will not disappoint. I am still suprised that the adaptation is almost perfect but more suprisingly the adaptors captured the feelings in the manga and successfully portrayed it in the anime. I feel as if there is something missing that could push this anime to a ten. perhaps other reviewers would give this anime the ten but its missing that ulimate spark that i haven't seen for a while. regardless its a great series and it is my favorite anime of this season. \
Current Overall: 9- Right now its at a nine in my opinion. it, however, can change as the series continues. i hate giving out a rating before the anime ends but thats my true rating for now. \
-Dead End- \

    I'm just going to keep this short and lazy.\
Amazing concept, very poor execution. Unlikable characters, very little plot consistency, writing sometimes falls to baffling levels of terrible.\
However, if every part of Mirai Nikki was as good as the beginning and the ending, it could have been great. Sure, some things didn't quite click, but the plot came together at least somewhat cohesively.\
Too bad the OVA screwed it up completely\

    I have decided that Yuno is now my spirit animal after watching this anime. Oh Ma Lord this anime was perfect...the Ova saved the sad ending as well. I wish I could show everyone this anime as it perfection. I was a late boomer to this anime and I watched it recently but I should've watched it earlier if I knew it was this good. I felt like I had the same buzz every time I watched an episode. As soon as I finished it, I said to myself that I would never find an anime as good as this one ever again...I ship Yuno\
          \

    First ever review, be nice. ^_^\
This anime moved me emotionally, forcing me onto the edge of my seat at least once every episode. Mix that with unique characters and you have Mirai Nikki.\
Whether you want cute or creepy, funny or violent, sad or happy. You'll find all of it in this amazing show.\
From the first fifteen minutes of the first episode I knew this show was going to be absolutely fantastic. It had me biting my nails and gritting my teeth, eager to watch the next episode as soon as one finished. \
The characters had vivid backgrounds and have a very real feeling to them.\
          \
        Some of them you want to hug whereas some of them you want to throw off of a building. Some of them both, some of them your opinions of them change throughout the show. \
Unique introductions to the characters which forced you to feel every emotion from sad to angry. A very interesting, and psychological anime with some creepy and cute aspects, loveable and hateable characters and major plot twists happening, Mirai Nikki will leave you in anticipation and begging for the next episode to start.\
Future Diary mixes in nearly every possible genre and manages to pull it off fantastically. A perfect ten out of ten. :3 ♥\

Okay last night I finished this anime, till the episode 22 or smth like that, the anime was pure perfection, you could easly binge watch it, but they screwed it up sooo badly at the last few ep. that im very pissed about it, like come on who ends an anime like that, I'm ookay with sad endings but that ending was terrible, I mean its okay if one of the main characters die, but in this Yuno almost completely forgets Yukki's existence, like comeee ooon, if only he died or smth and lived in her\
          \
        memory,but they compeltely deleted the person once she loved the most from her brain...WHO THE FCK DOES THAT, why they had to do this shiet ending, im so pissed about it that imma paste this comment on every damn Mirai Nikki review, SO THE WORLD KNOWS HOW PISSED I AM!!! If only the end left me with ''The void'' BUT NOO, they left me with damn anger...(For those who say watch the OVA you'll be satisfied), NO! NO! I'm not gonna watch the damn OVA, coz thats not the original ending, OVA's are for ppl who cant deal with the original ending...",

    I'll be forward and say my entire problem with this anime is the ending. Not unusual really. The entire last 2 episodes didn't need to exist and they could have come by the same conclusion if the anime hadn't broken its own rules in the end.\
With that said; it's still a really good anime and worth watching. The intros and outtros are both great and there are a lot of good characters. The overall story and twists are great and there are plenty of cliffhangers to keep you coming for more. So you should still watch it and just imagine your own ending that makes\
          \
        more sense.\
A couple of quick warnings for people though: there is kind of a lot of nudity in this series and some disturbing parts involving nudity (purposefully vague). Sometimes that can be good to know if you plan to watch something with some one else.\

    If you are looking for an exciting deathmatch in which every single mistake bears irreversible consequences and breaking out of a tough spot requires flawless reasoning, I sincerely recommend you giving up on a forced romance that is Mirai Nikki.\
The truth is, even the brightest premise can't shine if it's burried under horrible writing. This story doesn't progress as a natural result of made decisions - instead, characters are bent in order to make it move. As so, obstacles aren't overcome by brilliant ideas and hard work but either convenient coincidences or luck. Since \"nonsense\" is the leading word for action scenes, not even a\
          \
        bunch of qualified professionals can dream of fending off the almighty psychopatic girl. Add to this out of place comedy reliefs and behold the decaying remnants of tension. Let's not forget about explosives and traps which are just there, without any rational explanation of being set beforehand. Although these inconsistencies don't look like grave failures, they were enough to make me stop treating this show seriously pretty early. That, on the other hand, is a fatal mistake in a build-up to the incoming drama.\
However, when it comes to ruining the deadly and insecure atmosphere of a battle royale, I have no doubts that characters and their irrational behaviour take the lead. The main protagonists are far beyond having a plot armor - the whole world is constructed in a way that ensures their victory. With that said, their struggles lack of meaningful impact, so there's no need for them to reflect and change. Yukiteru Amano is often described as a pitiful loser, but is it possible for someone like him to hold on in the survival game without any redeeming qualities? He's merely a depending on others coward whose convincing development ended up at awkwardly swinging a weapon once in a while. As soon as stalking and possessiveness were outwardly portrayed as signs of deep care, I bid farewell to his potential to grow. Thus, the main character's strength in this deathmatch isn't courage, determination or inspiring attitude - it's his overwhelmingly powerful and insane ally, Yuno Gasai. She displays features of a mary sue as not only her combat abilities are unmatched, but also she can outwit enemies without much effort. Even if things don't progress according to her plan, she's not affected by consequences and her abuse is quickly forgiven. As the result, just like Yukiteru is free to stay weak if he relies on her, she doesn't have to strive to become a better person in order to reach her goal. I do believe the portrayal of Yuno is one of the most problematic aspects of this series.\
Since the characters who are given the most screen time are devoid of depth, nothing more can be expected from the other diary holders. I can't deny that they are diverse, though they do have two things in common. Firstly, each of them is over-the-top. Creating a candidate for the Deus' throne is easy - all you have to do is think about a driving motivation or a single trait from any category and take it to the extreme. Needless to say, enemies made like that are one-dimensional, though their cardboard textures are ineffectively concealed by either giving them a second feature which is contrasting to the first one or presenting a tragic backstory. The other similiarity is that they like to make their lives harder by playing around, so that they lose the perfect opportunity to kill the main duo or have a change of heart that results in helping them. If getting out of the toughtest situation without painful losses is this easy, the suspense is gone. What is yet another proof of the lazy writing, the narrative tries to convince us that a few kind lines are more than sufficient to quickly gain friends willing to sacrifice their lives for one's sake. Besides, a lot of relatively important questions are left unanswered, including the very origin of the survival game.\
The situation does become more dramatic in the last part, but the crucial problem remains: why would I care? As a viewer, I should be at least a bit attached to the protagonists and root for them after witnessing a plenty of their difficult battles towards the final destination. Looking back at the previous episodes, I'm supposed to be proud of how far they have come to stand here. None of these is present in Mirai Nikki as every conflict was resolved before leaving depressing mental scares. The triggering point of above mentioned drama was already implausible, but not as terrible as Yukiteru's reaction to it which brought out a reverse character development in a disguise. Therefore, the ending seemed to be dragged out to me and, despite of that, it didn't feel complete. It lacked of a convincing build-up and didn't make a coherent entirety with the rest of the story. \
With the exception of art and sound which are just fine, I can't find any strong points in Mirai Nikki. It doesn't have any memorable scenes, so I'm sure I'll forget it within a few days, though it wasn't a particularly dreadful watch either. As this show made it clear in what direction it was heading, I can't talk about disappointment here, despite being strongly against such a turn of events. At the very least, I don't regret trying to find out the reason behind its popularity - that, however, still remains a mystery to me.\

    This show is too over rated. All you half-witted punks out there with the ridiculous thought that an anime is always judged by its ending can stick the future diary 'mirai nikki' up your ass. i don't care how interesting the the ending turned out to be, it was nothing but a dull experience overall. This show cant get any worse than this, imagine if this show didnt even amuse to entertain me just a little till eps 10, what good is it gonna do later in the show?

        not it coz its lacking the most important part of engaging with the audience.\
After the boring 10 eps, the flower had finally bloom and proved that its not worth being dropped listed. however, its a shame that the anime still had me in disappointment with a few predictable twists here and there. by the end of the anime, i was left with resent toward the author's stupidity and taste in mystery and physiological genre.  \

    (very slight spoilers and a marked huge spoiler section) sorry i couldn't find a way to get my point across without a few examples.\
I wish i could say that Mirai Nikki was good. It has so much potential to be good, but somehow manages to ruin all that it could have been. From the very beginning i was interested in this story, and my god can it throwing you into the action. Those action scenes are amazing and i did not expect them at all at first. Its an amazing to see how quickly it jumps from relatively normal and slow to in your face\
          \
        fast action. \
Characters: These characters area almost good, but... then you start thinking about their motivations, and if you watch you start to realize these characters (all of them in the anime for the most part) are acting strangely. I don't mean as in character development although there are some characters that are developed correctly. If you see a character do something you really should ask yourself \"why?\" honestly there doesn't seem to be an reason for the most part or you might get some nonsensical motivation, for example.\
(skip this paragraph to skip huge spoilers)\
In a fight scene between Yuno and Aru, Aru easily defeats Yuno (first of all shouldn't be possible because we find out later shes a god) but leaves her alive because he doesn't want Yukiteru. Ok i can understand that to an extent he would be hurt and might even hate Aru if he did that, why he wouldn't do this for the greater good i don't know but meh i get it. But... he doesn't take her phone... The smartest character in the anime and the one that routinely shows off his intellect not because he's proud but because he's smart... just leaves her phone. It was a few minutes later when i realized why he left her phone. lazy writing... you see later on before Aru dies he tries to attack her phone not knowing that it will not kill her because its not her phone. Now the problem with this is, if he wasn't aiming for that phone he could have beat her again easily but the writers where lazy and chose to do this simply because it was easier, and if you look at the story character actions you realize many things such as Yuno being god Yukiteru shooting his friends without them stopping him and other moment would not happen if the characters stayed in character.\
(end of huge spoilers)\
Because of constant breaks in character there are huge breaks in the show where i was left to just wonder why her or she would act this way. \
Story: This goes very badly with the plot holes. There are many... many... plot holes. From moments where a character would choose to do things the hard way or just to screw something up that they have spent a few episodes building up to. Just the lack of \"why\" hurts the story as a whole.\
Art: The art style is... well everything else in modern anime, nothing great nothing horrible honestly. Simplify mediocre to be perfectly honest.\
Sound: The music is nothing interesting, i can honestly say i don't remember a singular song, score, or even note from the entire series.\
Overall: i can say i would never recommend this anime but if you're someone who wants to watch a love/action anime but not think about the story or characters, i can see you liking this even if i hate it, and honestly that's fine.\

    Story: 9\
This story is probably the best mix of psychological, thriller, action and romance. The story was well paced (although it felt a bit rushed during the final episodes) at the point I couldn't stop watching. The story is unique and always gets you by suprise at the point you don't know what to believe anymore. The fanservice almost nonexistent which I personally don't mind. About the ending...well you should really watch the anime to get the feels because it was simply amazing\
Art: 9\
Beautiful art, would rate it with a 10 but it doesn't feel right there is something missing, it's probably some of the\
          \
        stupidly drawn characters that take away the seriousness\
Sound: 10\
This is simply the best intro I have heard in a long time. You can say which character is crazy or scared simply by hearing them which also creates a great atmosphere\
Character: 9\
The character development is great you can see the protagonist growing throughout the anime from being a scared kid into a decisive leader, I didn't rate this with a 10 because I would like to know more about some characters. But overall each character has unique traits and develops as the story goes\
Enjoyment: 10\
I loved this anime and will definitely rewatch it once I find some time. Everyone that likes psychologica, thrillers should give this a shot\
Overall: 9\
Recommended. In my opinion every anime fan should watch this at some point\

    Battle scenes! Yandere! Bombs! What more could you want from an anime? \
Well Mirai Nikki gives you all of that and more!\
Story (9):\
Yukiteru Amano is an observer who writes everything that he observs in his cell phone. He is also a loner with no friends other than his 'imaginary' friend Deus Ex Machina. At least that is until he finds out that Deus is real and is a dying god. Deus gives him a 'diary' that predicts the future and he is set up in a battle-to-the-death/last-one-standing-wins scenario with 11 other ‘future diary’ holders and the last one standing gets to become god when Deus\
          \
        dies, or else the world will end. Yukiteru ends up teaming up with his schoolmate and long-term stalker Yuno Gasai to try to survive.\
Art (8): \
The art was generally very good. The style was very similar to the manga, which was good. The fight scenes were very well done and there were few inconsistencies. The character designs were simple but good and there was good attention to detail.\
Sound (9):\
The sound was truly amazing. For a start the voice actors were great, particularly Misuzu Togashi (Origami in Date a Live and Minatsu in Seitokai No Ichizon) as Yukiteru and Mai Aizawa (Mio in Nichijou and Rie in Clannad) as Minene.\
All of the music was very catchy and well suited to the anime. I loved the animation of opening and ending sequences.\
Charactrs (10):\
Honestly, I think the best part about Mirai Nikki is its fabulous characters. Everybody knows this anime for its Yandere character Yuno Gasai, who is crazy but still very lovable as well as mysterious. Yukiteru, who is a complete wimp, is not all that likeable but I do have to say is still a well-developed character. But that is not all this anime has to offer in terms of characters, in fact Mirai Nikki has a huge cast of loveable well-developed characters.To name a few, Minene Uryuu, a well-known terrorist who starts off as one of the ‘bad guy’ characters in the anime but transforms from a foe to an ally, and a very helpful one at that, and  Yukiteru’s mysterious schoolmate Aru Akise who loves to play the part of the detective and hardly ever shows up at school. And there are many, many more of these types of characters in this anime, too many to name, but all you need to know is that they are all really awesome!\
Overall Enjoyment (9):\
Overall I think that Mirai Nikki is truly an anime like no other. If you like somewhat horror-ish action anime, this is definitely an anime you should check out! ",

    *SPOILER FREE REVIEW*\
Mirai Nikki is the perfect example of how dark themes does not necessarily correlate to a mature anime.\
Story 5/10\
Mirai Nikki conveniently used every dark theme out there in a bid to create a mature anime. They used gore, murder, rape and so on and so forth. The end result was an anime with a poorly executed edgy feel.\
The plot was interesting, and the pace was consistently fast. However, the first 15 or so episodes failed to feel deep and meaningful. The subsequent episodes were better as a neat plot twist was thrown in the mix. That being said, I really did enjoy the\
          \
        resolution episodes, as the ending was satisfactory and reasonable.\
Art 8/10\
The art was crisp and the animation smooth. No complaints here.\
Sound 7/10\
The OP and ED were both decent but not particularly memorable. The OST was pretty mixed. Some tracks really amplified the mood and suspense whilst others felt like generic B-grade horror film music.\
Character 8/10\
The series revolves around two seemingly star-crossed lovers, Yukiteru and Yuno.\
Yuno was already a complex character and the development played along nicely with her quirks.\
Yukiteru starts off as a spineless, boring character which would go on to make the same mistakes time and again. However, his development throughout the course of the anime was laudable.\
The supporting cast, especially the other diary owners, were handled nicely. It is interesting how some antagonists had somewhat justified reasons for their behaviour which shows the thought put into the back story of the characters, important or not.\
Enjoyment 7/10\
The pace was engaging and I enjoyed the whole series, the only con being Yukiteru's off-putting initial personality.\
Overall 7/10\
Although I disliked some aspects of Mirai Nikki, it is still an anime worth watching\

    Many people are surprised when they see how I \"averagely\" I rated Mirai Nikki. After all, it's managed to obtain a huge amount of fans, especially for characters like the \"lovely\" Yuno Gasai. And it's not for nothing; the series has a very original plot that I can't say I've seen before even if it's, in its most basic form, a last-man-standing sadism game, similar to series such as Battle Royale.\
Anyway, so, why the bad rating? Simple. The characters. They are among the worstly developed and most unrealistic characters I have ever witnessed in any anime and/or manga. Funny considering what attracts the most amount\
          \
        of viewers is actually the characters, namely Yuno and Minene, and dare I say, sometimes even Hirasaka (also known as the weird Power Ranger with a balloon for a head).\
I feel the need to explain this better though, mostly because otherwise I'll be bashed by fans on how the characters are extremely well developed and have amazing psychological facters well explained in the anime. Well... that's false. \
Why? I'll explain it character by character. Do not worry, I'll warn if there's gonna be a spoiler.\
Okay, let's start with the fan favorite, Yuno, one of the best characters in the series indeed. The fact that she's a psychopath-stalker hides well behind the charade of her meek and cute character, and the events behind why she's insane make perfect sense, after all *SPOILER ALERT* you'd have to have an amazing mental fortress to be able not to go crazy when your crazy mother sticks you in a cage without food just because. *SPOILER END*\
Yuno, honestly, I don't have TOO much of a problem with...\
But now it's time to get hardcore. My favorite character is Minene, because she's just an awesome badass. Problem; she's a terrorist bomber. A terrorist. She kills innocents just because, and at the beginning of the series kills pretty much all of Yukiteru's classmates except for a couple lucky ones... yet afterwards everyone seems to forget the fact that she's a terrorist and she becomes a cute/badass tsundere... while she's awesome, that's a ridiculous flaw. Also *SPOILER* the fact that a cop falls in love with her and marries her despite her being a mass killer is just laughable. Also, that she has plenty of chances to kill Yukiteru but doesn't for absolutely no logical reason is yet to be explained o_O *SPOILER END*\
I've really elongated this a bit too much so I'm just gonna skip to the biggest piece of f****ed up s***t in the series, Yukiteru. From here on out there's gonna be a lot of spoilers so if you haven't seen the series just jump to the last paragraph D:\
First, he starts of as a whimp. Then, he gets the diary... and remains a whimp. Sure, all okay for now. Then he falls for Yuno despite for her being a stalker...then discovers that she has dead people in a room of her house, that she logically didn't think of hiding or anything. Why even, when it's perfectly hidden in a huge fucking room O_O\
So, he discovers that yet doesn't tell a cop who he knows and just so happens to also be a diary owner... why? No reason. Instead he decides to act like he saw nothing and STILL HANGS OUT WITH YUNO! Sure he acts scared, but that doesn't change the fact he keep staying in the vicinity of a stalking, psycopathic killer... next we have how a new friend of Yukiteru's later reveals herself to be the daughter of a diary owner and tries to kill him... and her innocent friend who seemed adorable also tries to kill people because why not. Then Yuki does some random motivational speech and they are all friends again... even though one of them almost died after being stabbed by another one of them...  NEXT UP! Yukiteru's divorcee father turns out to be a royal asshole who leaves Yuki in a falling building to die while he escapes with the last parachute... and then kills Yuki's mother accidentaly on purpose... and Yuki then decidedly forgives him and wants to see fireworks with him...AND I'M JUST GETTING STARTED GUYS! I also have to add a ton of scenes in a ton of episodes in which Yuki discovers from freaky shit from Yuno, freaks out and stays away from her for an ep or two, and then gets back together with her. Constantly. Like, every 5 episodes. At least. Also, remember how Yuki is supposedly psychologically growing due to all the stress and hardships? Yeah, there actually gets to a point where he apparently doesn't care anymore and starts to kill everyone just to win... two episodes later, mental breakdown, and he drops right back to how he had begun the series. As a worthless whimp. Great psychological evolution, great indeed.\
Now as for other flaws I want to point out. Apart from the diaries and Deus, we can more or less see that the world is supposedly our world... so then how is it explained that Hirasaka can create clones of himself and hypnotise people? How come the mayor not only talks to Deus, which we can push aside as the same with Yuki, but also somehow was able to, by himself, create the diares? How does a baby manage to get himself a ton of lethal armament and a gas mask? And forward mail? BEING A BABY? How come Yuno's father, apparently normal, knows that his wife is sick enough to stick his daughter inside of a cage without food for an entire day and doesn't do absolutely anything?\
...as for a final scene, mayor spoiler here of course, I want to add that the ending, despite looking like a \"happy ending\", with every character o so happy and such... we have to remember that that's just a different dimension. Those are other people. In our present Yuki's real dimension, he killed his friends. They are dead. Forever. They ain't coming back and they know who killed him. That \"happy ending\" is practically just an illusion. It's like watching a war film where everyone dies but then showing a happy family on the other side of the planet with no care in the world. Sure, they are happy, but our main characters arent'. Not one bit.\
\
Final paragraph here. So, in general, character development, character psychology... saying this series has it is an insult to psychology... this series is as realistic as Fairy Tail, although luckily this series isn't as bad as that one.\
It looks like I've ripped this series apart, and I won't say I haven't but its still got good things. The story, as I said, is really original and has some unexpected twists, the art is for the most part excelent and its quite enjoyable. The opening and ending songs are also a pleasant treat to listen to. So, good things are plot, art, music and general entertainment, but sadly it's not enough to cover the horrendous and blatantly terrible characters within.\

    This review contains no spoilers.\
With a newly acquired and unique future-predicting diary function attached to their cellphones, twelve people spread all over the city get involved in a battle royale to death organized by the current decaying god, in which the winner will become the new god of this world. And so our main character (who happens to be one of the twelve), an ordinary teenager shut-in named Amano Yukiteru, begins his journey accompanied by a mysterious female classmate that seems to know a lot about him. Which one of the Future Diary owners will rise victorious in this bloody thriller where toying with fate\
          \
        is nothing but child's play?\
Most synopsis for Mirai Nikki (The Future Diary in english) fail to be clear enough in depicting how amazing its possibilities were in terms of plot. What we get instead is an averagely entertaining show that is best watched with your brain turned off because its flaws are just too hard to overlook. The story, while apparently engaging at first, quickly devolves into nonsense that conveniently spawns one plot point after another. Even the whole constitution of the show (Cellphones that foresee the future and even your own death with some anticipation, while also getting you instantly killed if someone happens to destroy yours) is too far fetched and weak on it's own.\
The main character is a loner with zero redeeming qualities who is afraid of everything and the female lead, Gasai Yuno, is an annoying and sick murderer (that somehow possesses top notch assassin skills despite the fact that she's in school) who is pathologically attached to the main character. Oh she's also another Diary owner. While I understand that any normal person would be afraid in these circumstances, it is no excuse to have such an unlikable and WEAK male lead. It deserves to be mentioned, however, the fact that the main character does a 180° later on in the series, over the course of 1 episode or so, which adds to the overall hilarity.\
The rest of the cast (the other 10 and some random characters) are hard to describe. They are mostly stereotypical characters with a unique trait or two, some border so much on the ridiculousness that it really becomes hard to take seriously in the context of this show, not to mention that most are obviously discarded as the show advances due to the nature of the plot. While some are sort of interesting (and certainly better than the main two) they are not enough to save the character aspect of Mirai Nikki.\
Sound and animation are solid. Special mention to the first opening because it fits the mood and initial tone perfectly, definitely one of the best I've seen. The rest of OPs and EDs were alright, just like the voice acting and soundtrack. Animation was fluid, I have no complaints on that matter either.\
But anyway, it is a widely known fact that sound and art are not enough to save an anime. \
So fast forward to needless fan service, decisions and plot devices that lack any logic whatsoever, plot holes, ineffective comedy and EVEN the inclusion of homosexuality; Mirai Nikki simply fails to deliver the strong storyline that it seemed to have at first glance. That's not to say that MN epically fails in every aspect though... the action scenes despite being brainless and devoid of any realism / logic can still be entertaining, the female lead's twisted behavior can be amusing at times (generally when she's not being annoying as hell) and the sound and art are good. Kinda sad that those are all the positive things I've got to say about Mirai Nikki.\
So onto the detailed analysis:\
General: \
Atmosphere 7/10 --- Nothing stellar, I guess it's hard to build the proper mood for a battle royale filled with whiny teens for the most part. \
Characters  3/10 --- Disappointing and obnoxious. Secondary characters aren't that much better.\
Story development & ending 3/10 --- Weak and inconsistent. Despite being a free-for-all, at no point it stops being an episodic battle of the main characters against every single of the other 10. Also plot holes galore.\
Technical:\
Art 7/10 --- Good, no complaints.\
Soundtrack 9/10 --- Background music I don't know, but the OPs and EDs were great (mainly the first OP)\
Voice acting 7/10 --- Annoying, but that's how the characters were supposed to behave, and they did a good job at that.\
Personal:\
Priority (How eager I was to watch the next episode) 6/10 --- Caught my interest sometimes, not gonna lie.\
Memorability 4/10 --- I didn't care much when it ended, I didn't care much when I heard about the OVA release. Forgettable.\
Final score:\
5/10 --- Mediocre\
In closing, I can see why some people enjoyed Mirai Nikki, but for some reason I just couldn't bring myself to put up with the glaring plot holes and lack of logic present in almost every point of the show (I can somehow do that for other animes though). The characters and story pacing obviously didn't help much with that, either. Mirai Nikki is an entertaining anime if you are willing to turn your brain off at all the flaws it has and still manage to enjoy it, it has a powerful synopsis and it sure showed potential but in the end, like it happens many times, the execution was poorly done. \
Mirai Nikki is certainly not for kids! The themes it touches can be disturbing and the content itself is a little too explicit. I'd rate it for 16 y/o and higher.\
This was my first review, I hope you enjoyed it! \

    Mirai Nikki is the anime that made me realize how amazing japanese animation can be. Although, it's not as enjoyable for everyone. For say, if you don't like death and gore, chances are you won't like this anime, but without further ado, let's start the review.\
Story - 8/10\
To do this anime justice, you really need to look at the story in two parts, concept and plot. The concept of the story is actually amazing, basically twelve humans are given devices from the god of time and space, Dues Ex Machina, called \"future diarys\" that allow them to see up to 90 days into the future.\
          \
        Then, as explained by Deus, he is nearing his death and commands the diary holders to kill each other in a survival game, and the last man standing becomes Dues' replacment. This sounds great on paper, but as the story starts developing after gradually going through the anime, it feels as if it's just pushing you through a pile of cow manure and at the end is the largest peice of shit you've ever seen, the ending. I won't spoil the ending, but i'm going to say you WILL be dissapointed, and the stupidest part is that the OVA, Mirai Nikki Redial, I presume is there only to fix the shit ending, and THAT is still bad aswell! To sum it up, if you liked the concept, you will still enjoy the series and be able to get enjoyment out of the later episodes. BUT, if you don't like the concept, you might as well drop it before reaching Episode 10. \
Animation - 9/10\
The animation looks great, the characters look great, and the blood sure looks great! And that's great, because you'll be seeing alot of blood! That's really all I can say for the animation, it's great!\
Sound - 10/10\
Mirai Nikki's soundtrack is phenomenal. Opening 1 sounds amazing, it's fast, catchy, and is something I could listen to for hours without wanting to bash my head in AHEM Caramelldansen AHEM- Jokes aside, Ending 1 isn't as catchy as OP 1, but it definetly is pleasing to the ears. Opening 2 is my favourite track of the bunch. Yes, I like it better than OP1, mainly because it shows off all of the diary holder's powers. Sure, it's not as fast or catchy as OP1, but I'd rather sing this then that. Ending 2 is the worst track, just because it dosen't feel like any of the other songs at all! Overall, the sound really is amazing. \
Characters - 10/10 \
The characters are BY FAR the best thing about Mirai Nikki. Aside for the cowardly main character, Yukiteru, all of them are likable in one way or another. And there are ALOT of characters, so your bound to find one or two you like. I mean, Yuno is a murderous psychopath yandere, Fifth is a five year old who has access to poison gas and other deadly weapons, Ninth is the best terrorist ever, and Twelfth (My personal favourite diary holder) basically thinks he's a superhero of justice, and that's just to name a few awesome characters!\
Enjoyment - 10/10\
Aside from the bashing I did on the story earlier, you will find at least something to enjoy about Mirai Nikki. Please, give it a chance, even if the story turned you off. \
 Overall - 9/10\
Like I said before, Mirai Nikki is the anime that made me like anime, and there is a reason why. Maybe it's because i've always liked shows with alot of characters, or maybe it's because I like gore. I really hope this review made you at LEAST interested in Mirai Nikki, and to be honest, all of the great things about this anime probobly will pull you through the bad story in the later episodes. So, with that, thanks for reading! \
P.S: This was my first review! :D \

    Anime based on elimination games are usually predictable and uninspiring. Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) started out along the same path, but ended up being one of the more successful anime of the year\
Story 10/10\
Well plotted story. Its like a balance of love and hate. Though it was gory, the story makes you see why it was needed. Also that it makes you want to know how it will end up like despite the killing. A little cute in a way freaky how the obsession on a guy is but pretty interesting .  _ . \
The story revolves around a 14-year-old middle school boy named\
          \
        Yukiteru Amano. Yukiteru is a complete introvert that doesn’t like to get involved with others and even has his own “imaginary” world where he can talk to Deus Ex Machina (a.k.a. God). One day Yukiteru finds that the diary that he has been keeping on his phone is suddenly filling up with entries that predict the future. After narrowly escaping from the hands of a serial killer, Yukiteru finds out that Deus isn’t just a figment of his imagination, but an actual God. Deus informs Yukiteru that he has been chosen to participate in a battle royale with 11 other people that possess diaries that can predict the future. The winner will take over Deus’s place as God of the world. \
\
Art I'd give it an 8/10 \
Since it not that much was amusing they didn't take much detail on each character. Times when they are giving the look upon a person killing someone should look that scary or shouldn't turn away from their personalities, and image. It wouldn't be nice to scared or turn those people off about the characters they love. But the back round,was quite amusing. Nice landscapes .For such an intriguing series, it’s disappointing that the animation quality ranged from poor to average depending on the scene. Nothing really stood out that made me think “wow, this looks nice”, with the majority of scenes being of acceptable quality. Unfortunately, there were a few moments where I thought that characters looked more like stick figures than anime. The animation isn’t essential to the story, but the varying quality level detracts from the overall enjoyment of the series.\
Sound 9/10\
Since it sometimes wouldn't fit the situation at.Although the OST's were wonderful. But more fit to be on different kinds of situations through out the story.\
Character 10/10\
They plotted the character out well. On each and everyone's personality. Was very much clear if this was the killer, or what ever is up your mind. Times like this leads you to make conclusion or then making references.\
The personalities of the characters are definitely a strong point of Mirai Nikki. While Yukiteru is uninspiring, all of the other participants in the battle royale have some kind of quirk that makes them unique and interesting to watch. For example, one is the leader of a secretive cult that treats her like a god, while another is a young terrorist. Mirai Nikki doesn’t just leave it at that though, as most characters are given a descriptive background. The cult leader was once gang-raped by the very people she’s leading and the terrorist was orphaned in a war zone, leading her on a personal crusade. The most interesting character is by far, Yuno. She isn’t your typical head-over-heels in love girlfriend, but a psychopath bent on destroying anything that comes between her and her love. Yuno is the very definition of a yandere, which is someone who is so in love that it causes them to act in extremely violent ways.\
Enjoyment 10/10\
With no doubt will end making you wanting for more.\
Everyday craving another yet interesting episode. Too bad theres no more season 2 :P\
Overall is an 10/10\
One of the striking things about Mirai Nikki is that it has no reservations about using extreme violence. Those looking for action will find plenty of it here. There is everything including stabbing, mutilation, guns, poison, and explosions. What makes it even more shocking is that most of the characters are still underage. The extremes to which the children in Mirai Nikki will go to achieve their goals is disturbing but it’s what keeps you on the edge of your seat through the series.\
\
If you don’t mind some inconsistent animation and want to see some bloody action with a good plot, then definitely check out Mirai Nikki.\
By the way theres an OVA-ish for those who have finished Mirai Nikki. Called the Next project showing around the month of June? Or April.\

    Mirai Nikki or Future Diary is really an exceptional anime. In my eyes, it is a story with so much potential. Unfortunately I think they didn’t used all the potential it had. After the first five episodes I had something as WOW. This is the best thing I ever saw, this is just insane but how closer I came to the middle, the slower the story became. It started to get fillers and things that weren’t as original anymore as in the beginning. Luckily the last episodes became as original as the firsts again. What gave it a wonderful end that is really insane. Unfortunate\
          \
        I was still frustrated of the middle part that is why I didn’t enjoyed it as much as I was supposed to.\
The story is about a boy of 14 Yukiteru (a bit background information: They all have god names. I am just telling this because I didn’t noticed it myself back then. The numbers they later get are based on the ranks of those gods, so Yukiteru symbolizes Jupiter or in greek Zeus (who is the boss of the gods). Thats why he is number one) that holds a diary (his cellphone). He has become an observer that take notes of everything he sees. Along with that he has an imaginary friend (or at least he thought he was imaginary) Deus Ex Maxima the god of time and space. On a day after a weird conversation with Deus Ex Maxima about an unknown power, he stands up and was planning to write something in his diary. But he discovers that it is already filled in. First he thought it is fake and that he did it in his sleep or something. But still decided to give it a test but without any expectation of Yuki everything happened exactly as it is written. From throwing a double bullseye to getting the answers of a test he had that day. After that all 12 discovered the power of the diary Deus Ex Maxima took them all together with their bodies hidden as a shadow for each other. Then he starts explaining them the rules. It basically is the last one who survives becomes the new god of time and space. They yet don’t knowing each other's names or faces. They start looking for each other with just one clue their mirai nikki. Already the second day  Yuki was discovered by Yuno (number 2) that has a Yuki diary. But she asked to cooperate with him cause she sees everything what will happen to him while he sees what he will see in the future. So together they have a perfect view on his future. Just don’t forget that nobody can be trust in a game like this and just imagine that someone knows everything you do even before you do.\
Guess you can start to understand now why I think it has so much potential. It isn’t just a survival game. It is way more original than that. Especially because that not two mirai nikkis are the same. The way this psychological thriller starts is insane. You know what will happen and only people with a mirai nikki can change that. However when the future is changed that much that you are going to die. The only thing the mirai nikki says is dead end, then you need to change the future as quick as possible. But the biggest problem is that you don’t know what you need the change. Another great thing is that it isn’t predictable at all. You simply never know who is going to die next.\
Now this is said you probably have a good idea of the principles of the story. So now I can go further on the other elements. To be honest there is only one thing that really made me fell in love with this serie. That reason is Yuno. She is just the most insane character I ever saw. Her unbelievable love for Yuki, The way she does everything with passion especially killing is so great. She is just a real psychopath that isn’t one bit predicable. She can be the best girlfriend you could ever wish for while tomorrow it might be the baddest you ever had. Yuki wasn’t bad either he just needs time to blossom in a beautiful character while Yuno was that insane from the beginning. Unfortunately things can never be perfect. Because Yuno is such a wonderful well thought character the other characters are being placed at the background and not only that. Because of that they other characters aren’t also well developed and thought out. It is so unfortunate that the best part of the serie causes one of the baddest parts of the serie.\
For the rest it has a bit or even plenty of everything. The emotions the serie creates cannot be expressed in words. It is full of despair that creates hope. They can let you feel like two persons. It was the first time I had experienced that I was sad and happy at the same time. It isn’t completely like that. It was actually more that something happened and that I didn’t know how I should’ve felt about it. Even though I didn’t knew what I felt, I knew for sure that the music only made it even ten times stronger. So however I was full of emotion I didn’t knew which one it was. They just mindfucked me so mutch that they literally made a autist of me. The voice acting and the Ost can really do a lot here under the right circumstances. The rest (drawings, excitement) where nothing special, they aren’t bad though.\
So it is really unfortunate that the middle was full of boring and bad fillers where the creative level sinks for more than hundreds of meters. Otherwise this could’ve been the best anime ever in my opinion.\

    Mirai Nikki is a very exciting anime with a outstanding character named Yunno Gasai.Everybody who watches this series surely falls in love with Yunno.\
She alone is one reason to watch this show because she is the defination of Yandre.Other characters also have enough screen time so they are also good to keep show going.\
The story is very interesting and keeps you make guessing what happens next.\
The story has many twist and turns with enough blood and gore.It can be funny at times but overall it is a very serious anime.\
The best part of this show is personal enjoyment although ending was not so nice although\
          \
        ova tried to cover it.Everybody should give it a try \

    Mirai Nikki – A bloody psychological/supernatural thriller. Initially you will no doubt notice similarities between Mirai Nikki and the incredibly popular Death Note, but in the end its completely different.\
Throwing middle-schoolers and deranged psychopaths(or in case of Yuno both at the same time) into a battle royale that will decide who will become the next god of time and space – Mirai Nikki is great series, but definitely not for everyone.\
Art 7/10\
The art of Mirai Nikki is decent, but by no means great.  Animation is not always fluid, there are allot of undetailed objects, and characters are by no means pretty. However the art\
          \
        direction Mirai Nikki has taken fits the story very well. Its dark, its bloody and psychopaths look like psychopaths(but more on that in character section of this review). As the source material – the manga is not pretty(average at best), the anime adaptation actually improves the characters in my opinion, while staying faithful to the source material.\
Sound 9/10\
Mirai Nikki’s openings are truly great, especially the first one, they fit the anime perfectly, the animations might contain spoilers but in a way that you will not realise that you are seeing a spoiler. Ending songs, are decent as well  once again first one being better. The OST is also very good, especially during the fights in the last part of the anime.  Voice acting is splendid – especially Yuno, her seiyuu(Murata Tomosa) perfectly plays both her cute and innocent side as well as the bloody psychopath side, I was really surprised when I found out her voice actress only had one other role: a supporting character in Desetsu no Yuusha no Desetsu – after her amazing performance in Mirai Nikki I think we will be hearing her quite often. Other voice actors also did a solid job, but nothing groundbreaking there.\
Story 8/10\
Story in Mirai Nikki is hard to rate: While early on, and in the middle its really good, the last few episodes are a mess. It feels like Mirai Nikki didn’t realise its full potential, it could have been the next Death Note, The Future dairies that characters possess offer a great deal of tactical possibilities, yet most fights involve knifes, hatchets and guns and little thinking. The twists in the story are really unexpected, but not in a way “I haven’t thought of that!” more like “what? How is that even possible”, there are plenty of plot holes and inconsistencies(especially later on), that you will have to ignore if you want to enjoy the series... and about ending...let's just say it's ... mediocre although the studio didn't have much to work with - manga ending is arguably even worse..\
Characters 8+/10\
If you thought the story was a mixed bag, then just wait until you read about characters. On one hand we have Yukkiteru – the male lead. He is beyond pathetic with absolutely no redeeming qualities. Its fine if male lead is a weak coward, but he is intelligent, but Yukkiteru is not only weak, cowardly, easy trusting but also incredibly stupid. I guess you could blame it on the fact that he is a middle schooler. But without Yuno he probably couldn’t even tie his shoe laces. Also when you think he has progressed he will go back to his old useless self the next episode. Now the other lead – Yuno Gasai is completely different, she is an amazing character – incredibly strong in a fight, smart and obsessed with Yukkiteru. She kills without a second thought, and when someone or something gets in the way of their relationship she wont think twice about murdering said threat.  You don’t see murderous 14 year old psychopaths as main characters often. The rest of the cast is also great (apart from the “trio of friends from school”, they will definitely piss you off), almost all of the characters have at least a slight mental disorder which is definitely cool.\
Enjoyment 9+/10\
This is where Mirai Nikki succeeds, an almost flawless victory in fact. Every single episode ends in a way that you will immediately want to watch next one, there are no fillers(maybe half of 2 episodes). I have really enjoyed the series, even with the plot holes and inconsistencies in the story, however if you are the type of person that really gets annoyed when something doesn’t make much sense or you hate Deus ex Machina (not to be mistaken with the character from this series) then it might not be the best anime for you. There is also plenty of gore - this obviously is a good thing for some and bad for others, none of the gore feels forced and I think it fits the atmosphere of the show perfectly so it is a plus.\
Overall 8+/10\
I was torn between 8 and 9, mostly because Mirai Nikki has many flaws Its going to be 8+. I enjoyed Mirai Nikki immensely, but I can see why people might rate this show 7/10 or even 6/10, it's nevertheless worth watching.\

    The first thought that crosses my mind when hearing the name of this anime is the word weird.\
The story is about a boy who gains a diary which tells the future, twelve other people have different types of diary and the final survivor becomes \"God\". Their version of God is a little different, but it's just basically someone with tons of power to control things etc. \
When first watching this anime, I was definitely sure that I'd rate it no higher than a 7. However as the story progressed the plot sped up quickly I became more interested in the story, but once it got\
          \
        to the middle of the anime the story drastically slowed down and became slightly boring. What kept me watching the anime was the curiosity of what the end result of the story would come to.\
The anime has \
-Psychotic\
-Dark\
-Creepy\
themes.\
Story 8/10: The story itself wasn't bad, it's kind of interesting to see how things work out and the idea of a \"future diary\" is intriguing. \
Art 8/10: Nothing really special about the art. It's not bad, but it's not something that'd amaze you. \
Sound 9/10: The songs are pretty good so is the background music\
Character 7/10: At times I strongly disliked the two  main characters throughout most of the story.. Some other characters I found really touching, and momentous but often times the main characters are simply just annoying. \
Enjoyment 9/10: I watched this anime in two days, it was an interesting watch. I don't feel like I wasted my time, it's not that the anime is bad it's just not \"blow your mind\" type.\
Overall 8/10: This anime is probably worth a watch if you're out of anime to watch, or want to save up some episodes on your ongoing series. I would not judge the anime by the first 5-ish or so episodes, because things speed up quickly.\

    Ok, before I start, I want to say that this is all my opinion, which you may or may not agree with. I am aware that everyone does not think like I do and there will be controversy, but to be fair you should respect my opinion as I am not forcing you to think like I am and this is just a review. Thanks :)\
Mirai Nikki... I will start of by saying this: amazing character design, fair enough visuals, and a good story, combined with good sounds. You may think that I very well enjoyed this anime.... Well if you did, I am sad\
          \
        to say that you are wrong. You may ask why, and I shall tell you with my heart: I extremely dislike Yuno! Why? Well, because of Yuno, she managed to ruin the plot, character design and my overall enjoyment. I will explain more as I review the rest of the aspects of the anime.\
Story & plot: \
Positives: Although the story is not overall original, as it was very much similar to Deadman Wonderland... The plot I may say, was very original and very intriguing as well. Every episode I was very interested to see what would happen next as each episode builds up with the \"juicy stuff\" and the twists and turns in the plot. Therefore, many things were unexpected , as the situation increases, and that is what makes the anime so enjoyable.\
Negatives: The negatives actually overshadow the positives and that is because of one reason, for which I will get to. But, I would start of with the episodes near the end of the series; the anime tried very hard to build up the drama in each episode and tried to make it more complex. Although they somewhat achieved this, it also left with many plot holes which simply overshadow the complexity that the makers of the anime where trying to achieve. Also, including near the end, because of the plot holes, the plot simply diverged into two plots being a deathmatch survival game and a Yandere bullcrap thing. Because of the Yandere bullcrap thing, the anime gets ruined with the unnecessary scenes of \"love\" which made me barf. Without the Yandere bullcrap thing, the anime could've advanced in the story with less polt holes and more complexity without having to include unnecessary scenes. Oh yeah did I mention the ending is rubbish? The Yandere crap also helped made the character design fail as well.\
Character design:\
Positives: Mirai Nikki had one of the best character designs of all time, which eventually breaks down during near the end of the series. Characters are all very intriguing with their own backgrounds, morals, and goals. Each character also has their very own \"voice\" and are all very diverse with interesting personalities. Throughout the show, characters also develop more, and change sometimes their views. So, unlike most anime, the characters only become better and better as you learn more about them. The anime, being so that it has a diverse range of characters, it gives the viewer a chance to \"bond\" with a certain character.\
negatives: Throughout the show, being so that all the characters are so different, and some don't get enough scene time, and your favorite character may only last for so long... it is very unfortunate when your favorite character dies, since no one else can replace them.... Next, because the plot diverges into two separate plots, many once was important characters become no longer important as they seem to be discarded without a good end to any of them\
which makes the only two \"important characters\" currently existing are: Yuno and Yuki. Because of that, all of the feeling and whatnot the other characters had, are now deemed to be nothing. The only relationships that the main character has now, is with Yuno. Where did all the other characters go?! The main character also changes into being a retarded f***! \
Everything else was fine enough, and wasn't very interesting to review on, as they are not bad nor too good. Therefore, this brings my call to action... Please, destroy the love relationship between Yuno and Yuki and change it to a friendly one. Although many people think that it drives the plot, there only has to be a slight fixture which everything else can still be the same. If Yuno and Yuki only had a friendly relationship, then the plot can remain fairly the same, only less disgustingly exaggerated, and with way less plot holes which makes the ending better. This can also change the character design; since Yuki and Yuno's relationship isn't that significant anymore, other characters can now be more important and the main character doesn't have to be a snot. I also won't be disgusted with the \"love scenes\" (they are definitely not pretty). Oh yeah, remember that horrible ending I said earlier? Yeah, with the \"love\" being replaced with friendship, the ending would be much better.\
Final Verdict: Normally I would probably give the anime a 1/10 as I disgusted and pissed of throughout the anime. But, if the \"love\" can just be friendship, then I will give the anime: 7.12/10\

    Mirai Nikki, where do i begin? One of my favorite animes.  Its a great story and you can´t wait for the next episode. If you got a weak heart or are Afraid of blood i woulden´t recomend this serie for you, if you are like me and a bit twisted GZ you just found a great anime\
Beside from the blood and violence i realy like when you get to know the characters. The mindblowns are real and the plots are realy smart. This may sound a bit mean but if you are stupied this anime will be a bit hard for you to fallow.\

    Yeah I know what you're thinking: \"All 10s and a 9? Somebody's biased.\"\
And maybe I am; maybe I'm easily impressed.\
I absolutely loved this show. I'm a guesser when it comes to most shows, so ones where I can predict some elements of the end without actually spoiling it for myself I find to be very entertaining.\
The end is certainly a mind-blower, and can be confusing without some much needed explanation, so be sure to watch the Redial OVA after you've finished this wonderful series. It gives the explanation that is missing here, and is the only reason I gave 'Story' a 9 instead of a\
          \
        10.\
The art and sound were both wonderfully done, with beautiful and flowing animation and 3d that meshes quite well, and music and voice acting to match. (Though Yuki's crying in the dub is rather annoying-sounding)\
The characters are largely well-developed and very interesting, especially that of Yuno Gasai, who made up the majority of why I watched Mirai Nikki in the first place. Right from the start I had so many questions about her; I needed to know her secrets, I NEEDED to know her past. When all was revealed, I was simultaneously mind-blown, satisfied, and extremely happy.\
I would easily recommend this to any anime fan who is old enough to handle its overall maturity.\

    Mirai Nikki: grab a bunch of psychopaths, hand each of them a diary that predicts the future, make them kill each other and you’ve got yourself the germ of an entertaining story.\
This is a show for those looking for some over the top entertainment. It has action and suspense, but unfortunately also plotholes and a lead character who is a wimp for a good first portion of the series. In the end the pros do make up for the cons in this series, but it takes patience.\
The bigggest problem with this series is that the characterization takes a really long while to get going. At\
          \
        the beginning of the series, Yukiteru (tha male lead) is a typical coward who once in a while does something heroic. The side-characters are all pretty dull and one-sided, and it doesn’t really feel like any of them comes to his or her right. The only one who really stands out is the lead female: Yuno. The biggest selling point of this series and the mother of all yandere. But even she takes a while to really get going, and is for most of the first half of this series a deranged psychopath without much depth either. The interesting stuff only starts when the characters start to develop and change over the course of the series. This is where the cast gets depth, Yukiteru grows balls, and the characters come together more and this is where the series gets really fun to watch.\
Something also needs to be said about the plot: it can get quite creative in the plot twists it delivers to the viewer. It however is not as clever for this premise to really work, and as a consequence it’s full of plotholes. When you stat to watch this series, you really need to realize this, because there are way too many leaps in logic and weird coincidences that would instantly break any normal suspense of disbelief. It’s the kind of series where you need go go along with the flow, no matter how ridiculous it may get t times.\
Because in the end, this does reward, even though it takes a while to get there. Mirai Nikki’s biggest problem is that it stumbles on for a good 10 episodes in uninteresting fights, challenges and characters, and it’s not even for the sake of build-up either. At one point it just decides to make its character arcs longer and actually use some character development effecitvely, and that’s where it becomes quite an entertaining ride. The ending is a bit weird, but heck, this show at least doesn’t skimp on entertainment value.\
Just one thing: try to avoid getting spoiled about this series. It’s the kind of series that is hard to rewatch, because a lot of the fun is in its surprises that it pulls you. Storytelling:\0099/10 – Very entertaining plot twists, but is a bit annoying in its first halves. Characters: 8/10 – The side-cast in particular really needs a long while to get going, but in the end the character development is pretty good all around. Production-Values:8/10 – Good soundtrack, animation that’s nothing special, but does what it needs to do. Setting: 8/10 – The setting is just insane, but that’s part o this series’ charms.\

    The plot of this anime did not disappoint me at all. Though at some further points of the story the plot became a little muddled, it was without a doubt engaging. The threat of imminent death is certainly a factor that grabs a viewer's attention, and at no point did the story falter in delivering excitement. There are a few scenes that provide backstory for various characters which could deter from the main plot, but I thought they were interesting to know given the variety of characters that were introduced. Also, at the end of many episodes there was a comedic short to give a\
          \
        few more details about certain characters, which were cute and a good break from such heart-stopping action.\
Sometimes I thought the animation for Mirai Nikki was lacking, like in some injuries of people that were killed very quickly (non-realistic blood spurts and such), but that was very few times. The majority of the time I was satisfied with what was there: other realistic blood spillage, starry skies, closeups on alarmed eyes, stricken expressions of those who uncovered grave secrets, etc. Some larger structures like buildings and trains were drawn with very straight lines and and a different style from the rest of the scenery, a stark show of realism against another type of animation. \
I was not so impressed with the soundtrack in the first few episodes of the anime (I still think the first opening song is weird), but I soon grew to like it a little. It has appropriate music for certain scenes, when someone's life is in peril, while someone has a bittersweet flashback, etc. In that sense it isn't bad.\
The protagonist, if you haven't figured it out, is Amano Yukiteru, a black-haired and reserved boy who frequently dons a hat and wears shorts. He does start out as that typical weakling who can't protect himself so much and is a complete coward, and for a good chunk of the anime he hardly has any character development. But of course, it does take him a while to break out of his shell, and he isn't a bad character. I just wish he was able to overcome his weaknesses sooner. There are a few times where he really shines as an individual and takes advantage of his potential, so as the protagonist he does do the job well when he reaches that moment.\
I'm sure everyone has seen Gasai Yuno, the other main character who is always seen with Yuki. She is an intelligent pink-haired beauty at Yuki's middle school. Yuno is probably the most intriguing character I've ever known, a two-sided girl who can be fierce enough to kill people and yet love Yuki at the same time. Though I don't like everything about her, her personality is certainly worth watching the entire anime for, for sure.\
The range of personalities in these multiple unique characters is amazing. Everyone has their own motives, appearance, mannerisms, and more which make them all admirable people (unless of course, you think their cluster of traits is the opposite of admirable).\
Did I like this series? Absolutely! The plot ran so well such that the cliffhangers didn't annoy me so much as they do in some other anime; I had to watch more and that was that. Part of me binge watching this show was so that I could finish before the end of my break, but the other part of it was because I had to know what happened next. I was also very interested to know about the characters. Most of them were cool to know and some had a good sense of humor. \
All in all, I'm not surprised that Mirai Nikki is one of the mainstream series out there. The plot is superb, character designs are excellent, and the show is great. It deserves a 9/10 from me.\

    In my opinion this anime was very good. The moment you hear the intro song you know its a good anime. 'kuusou mesorogiwi' really grabs the watchers attention with its dark sounding song.\
So anyway the plot, the anime is about 13 people in a death game quite similar to the hunger games. Each person has their own future diary what tells the future but each diary is different. To win the game you must be the last survivor and your award is you become the next god of time and space. But if you break your diary then you die.\
The characters are all very different\
          \
        and we do find out that each one is broken in some way from their past. But our main characters are Yukiteru Amano and Yuno Gasai. These two are both teens who go to the same school and you do find out that Yuno has feeling for Yuki for a long time but she is very obsessed with him. This is why she is by far one of my favorite anime characters she is very cute but is also very violent and after you watch the anime you remember her. But when it comes to Yuki I really did not like his character and the reason for it is hes just a coward. For example he couldn't stick up for himself he always needed Yuno by him side and when he did have the courage to kill someone by the next episode he would go back to his cowardly ways what is very frustrating.\
Anyway the art style, it was good but nothing amazing but  bloody what i did enjoy about it considering there is alot of death involved. The voice acting was also alright but Tomosa Murata who voiced Yuno did an amazing job at catching her crazy where in the dub Yuno didn't sound as good in the sub.\
Did I enjoy this anime?  Yes its actually one of my favorites each episode you will be wanting more and when it comes to the ending....Wow it blew my mind but here is something to consider when you come nearto finishing the anime pay attention or you wont understand how it ends because its kinda confusing least that's what happened to me. \
Over all i'm going to rate the anime a 8/10 stars and say that its a 15 because there is blood and some fan service but anyway thats the end of this review ^__^\

    I'd like to repeat what someone said in the comments section of Future Diary once...This is a crappy anime with a good execution. That was their conclusion and that pretty much wraps up my own.\
I really enjoyed this anime at first. The crazy female lead was entertaining and I loved laughing at how pathetic the main character was. But I soon began to notice tons of plot holes and I realized I didn't really like any of the characters except for Yuno, and that was only half the time.\
This anime makes all sorts of random crap happen without explanation or with a bad explanation at\
          \
        that. Dreadful things like blowing up children is glossed over and the show expects you to feel sympathy for the characters who did these terrible things. \
The anime tries to have plot twists but I just find myself staring at the screen, wondering why I should even care anymore. The only reason I managed to finish the whole thing was because part of the time I decided to turn off my brain. I realized that this anime was never going to make sense and that if I wanted to enjoy it at all I'd have to ignore all of its problems.\
But even those problems became too big to ignore. The only character I partially cared for was Yuno, and the anime even ruined that in the end. The conclusions all of the characters come up with in emotional moments make absolutely no sense to me. I felt no sympathy for the characters. I didn't care who won by the end or who lived or who died. I just wanted to finish the anime and be done with it.\
So many people said that this was the \"best anime ever\" and I had put off watching it for a long time. I had high expectations coming in. I thought that I had saved something really good for later or something like that. After finishing the anime I don't understand how anyone could honestly tell me that they think this is the best anime ever.\
This is my second big disappointment with the anime community. One can usually trust that they'll give you something good to watch but with this anime that is just not the case.\
If you just want to see a bunch of people killing each other and are capable of completely turning off your brain, by all means you will enjoy this anime. Have at it. But if you're like me and you can't turn off your brain and senseless killing doesn't do anything for you, please stay away from this anime.\

    ~~~~~~ Focused on reasons why you should and shouldn't watch the series, in this review i wont be extensive on the plot and the general aspects ~~~~~~\
\
So! Why should you comfort your butt in front of the lappy get the popcorn and the diet cola?\
- Pretty descent animation, awesome facial expressions  (especialy Yuno's), dim backgrounds making you feel the suspence of the series even more.\
- Breathtaking action scenes, plot twists one after another, fast pacing while you learn what you need to know about the characters.\
- Chaotic protagonist (Yuno) who will make you fall in love with and dispice at the same time.\
- B-roles\
          \
        who actually are important. So no useless acquaintances.\
- Interest on the plot from the very first 10 minutes. Plot unfolds really smoothly.\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
If you are not convinced, then maybe you should continue reading my review. The dissadvantages vary from everyone's taste on animes.\
- There is some kind of romance that a few fans may not find convincing, although, the plot unravels through the episodes based on the this \"kind\" of romance. I use the quotes, because this is a psycological thriller, not a romantic story. If you dont like any kind of romance, just trust me.... :)\
- You might find the other protagonist repelling, according to you standards on the toughness and strong will you may want a character to be. But that's the spice on the rice! Most of us, if we were in this kind of twisted situation (watch the anime godammit :P ), we would probably be like Yuki!! \
- Catharsis isn't always an option on psycological thrillers... And catharsis is ambiguous from viewer to viewer for this anime.\
- The story isnt that much innovative, but that's not the point for this anime.\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
If you want my proposition, watch first Magica Madoka the series, after the series watch the 3d movie, then Nikki Mirai and finaly Deathnote. \
The 3 series unravel the inner demons of the protagonists as much as the inner god of their souls.... Give it a try... PLEASE let me know if you found this review USELESS! It would make me happy to know the flaws of my way of thinking! :) :) :) \

    I started watching Mirai Nikki when episode 23 aired. I finished downloading them all at around midnight, and I stayed up until I had watched them all.\
 -The story is amazing (10). When I started watching, I thought it would a predictable story that wouldn't entertain me at all, but it was quite the opposite. I don't want to spoil anything, though, so I'll just leave it at that.\
 -Art? Loved it (9). The animation is very good, and it stays with the sort of creepy feel of the anime, while at the same time looking normal when it needs to be. The characters have\

        pupils. I don't know what it is about them, but it adds to the creepiness during the creepy parts.\
 -Sound. (9). I've enjoyed both of the OPs, especially the first. They both suit the anime very well, and they, unlike some other anime like this, don't show spoilers about the story. In the show itself, the voices and sound effects are great. They avoid having any music at some of the suspenseful parts, and this only adds to the suspense. I personally don't like it when suspenseful music plays at these parts because it just tells me something will happen. The voices are all good, too, especially considering how the seiyuus of both main characters are inexperienced. \
 -Character (9). Most of the characters develop over the course of the show, especially Yuno. I can't really say much else without super-spoilers, but the  only reason this isn't a 10 is because so far, Yukiteru hasn't developed as much as I think he should have. Not to say he hasn't changed, though, because he has. It would be a 9.5 if I were allowed to give it that.\
 -Enjoyment (10). It kept me up for about 8 hours or so, from midnight to about 8am. I think that's enough to say how much I enjoyed it. \
 -Overall (10). Sure, there are more 9/10 ratings than 10/10, but considering how good everything was, 10 seems fair. I think I will forever be a fan of this show, and regardless of your type of anime, you should watch it too. I'm usually a fan of slice of life/comedy type anime, and, hold off the \"lol of course, anything is better than slice of life\" jokes, I enjoyed this to no end. \
Get off your ass, stand up, sit back down again, navigate to a site where you can watch this in 1080p, and spend the next 8 hours of your life watching it. That is an order, and you will enjoy it.",

    I decided to watch this based on the recommendations seen here on MAL.  After Steins;Gate I was looking for something kind of on par in terms of weirdness, and I got a LOT more than I bargained for here.\
The basic premise is, the main character Yuki - for reasons I won't get into - is able to see future events via his cell phone.  Using this, he has a chance at becoming a god.  That's all I'm saying, from here you can guess why there may be conflicts with this, and where some of his enemies may sprout from.  I was\
          \
        very cautious with the reviews I read, and the whole series was just a complete surprise to me.  \
Something this show did well was leading you into thinking one direction, then taking you somewhere else.  I don't know if I'd call it plot twists, but they're just simple explanations that you may not have considered.  That said, the scale of the story is pretty ambitious.  So it retains a balance between simplicity and complexity that kind of leads you guessing what's going to happen next.\
As far as just small enjoyment, there wasn't an episode where I didn't utter \"What the hell..\" during.  Not all the turns this story takes are huge revelations in terms of the overall plot, just subtle events that make you feel very uneasy that may or may not come back to haunt the characters.\
The visuals were overall pretty great, I can't say I have any complaints in that regard.  One thing I have to say is the initial intro is probably one of the best I've ever seen.  There wasn't an episode where I wanted to fast forward through it (until it was updated of course).  This goes along with my comment on the music, which absolutely leaves an impression.\
Overall, I'm very satisfied with this show.  It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I enjoyed every minute of it.\

    Story-6/10\
Gasai Yuno: Don't you know? I really, really, really love you to death, Yukkii.\
Although it takes a while to unravel, the romance in Mirai Nikki ends up being very poignant. Up until the last few episodes, the real story of Gasai Yuno remains somewhat of a mystery. Although this method of using hidden information will keep you curious as to what’s going on, the romance will unfortunately come across as very childish and forced. This very difficult to care about (and very much one sided) ‘love’ continues for the majority of the anime until finally, the secret of Yuno is revealed. When this happens, all\
          \
        of those issues with the romance are pretty much solved and the final few episodes end up featuring some incredibly powerful and emotional scenes. After seeing Mirai Nikki’s obvious skill in delivering this drama, it just seemed a shame to have such a standard and immature build up to the climax. \
Sadly, the supposed main story of a survival game ends up just being a plot device for the romance. The dramatic story of Yuno and Yukiteru requires very specific conditions. Thus, the main plotline will decide to change radically and suddenly just to fit these conditions. Most of the time, these ‘plot twists’ have absolutely no reasoning behind them; they just happen. Although this obviously benefits the romance, the survival game itself ultimately becomes a total mess. By the end, even main characters start to defy the laws of physics simply so the ideal circumstances for Yuno and Yukiteru are created. If the main focus was always the romance, was there really any point in having something so complicated to confuse things? \
Art-6/10\
The artwork in Mirai Nikki was passable but rather confusing. The artwork never stood out as one of the strengths of the anime. The backgrounds and city views were pretty standard. The beauty behind any aspect of the show was also weak. Where the artwork really succeeded was with the intense/ dark scenes. There was always this juxtaposition with using an innocent design in a sinister way, and while Yuno herself best epitomises this, certain scenes in the anime were also equally as successful. In terms of character design, I was never sure how serious to take Mirai Nikki. On one hand you have a determined, and mischievous looking terrorist, on the other hand you have an oversized, female Oompa Loompa… Wat? I never felt decided on how serious to take Mirai Nikki in the first place, but things like that are completely out of place. \
Sound-9/10\
The soundtrack in Mirai Nikki was superb. The show has do deal with a great number of contrasting themes; Yuki may be sitting down with his family one moment and the next, Yuno will be going completely nuts killing everyone. The soundtrack was able to use some really successful OSTs to smoothen this transition. There was also a basic language between the tracks, for example using the same melody but using different instruments to set different moods. Where the sound and art really come into their own is with the OP’s and ending songs, all of which were marvellous. They do a great job of setting the mood in a creative way. Here are a few tracks which best set the mood of Mirai Nikki; ‘Kūsō Mythology’ (the first OP), ‘Blood teller’, and of course the stunning OST (whose name I cannot find),* just type in* ‘volume 2- Track 5 Mirai Nikki’. \
Characters-7/10\
Mirai Nikki showed some great potential in terms of characters. The main character, Yuno, was both able to grasp my attention (because of the underlying mystery) and consistently hold it because of her unexpected and completely barmy actions (very much like the show itself). It is always great to see a character that can instantly set you in the mood for that particular show. Other characters like Uryuu Minene also have a strong sense of individuality and were able to entertain through their own decision making that didn’t revolve around benefiting the story.   \
Whilst the shows designers clearly had some skill, they rarely used it. The supporting cast was weak. In a survival game with a main character (i.e. the obvious future winner), other characters just seem to exist to develop that main character, then die in an entertaining manner. What was really off-putting was that in Mirai Nikki, even the characters themselves seemed to know this and would do some of the most illogical things just so Yuno/ Yukiteru could benefit. Even Yuki was at it when the story of Yuno needed saving! The rest of the cast ended up being fleshed out by the standard array of stereotypical archetypes which was especially disappointing. \
Enjoyment- 9/10\
Mirai Nikki definitely did entertain. There was plenty of drama, action and mystery to satisfy. What I found particularly successful was that each show would both develop the story and provide some light hearted entertainment. As a result, there weren’t any over complicated story explanations, nor was there too much booby touching to frustrate me. Admittedly, the most entertaining aspect of the show was indeed Yuno. It was good fun to just simply watch her mind work and see her in action. The only thing holding back my enjoyment was the fact that I wore my thinking hat very securely on my head. Mirai Nikki, for better or for worse, does require you to put this to the side…\
Overall-710\
As much as you will enjoy it, Mirai Nikki has its fair share of flaws. For example the undeniable focus on Yuno, which resulted in the discarding or radical modification of different aspects of the story when needed. Whether I recommend watching Mirai Nikki, I would say yes. Just don’t expect a masterpiece. Go in instead with the expectation of a good ol’ bit of entertainment. ",

    This is my first time writing a review so if I wrote anything that you don't agree on or you just hated my writing skills my apologies. Basically, this anime is about survival horror, psychological, romance, supernatural, suspense. If you like watching characters going CRAZY I recommend you to watch this anime.  It starts of a middle schooler Yukiteru, an anti social bystander who writes everything he see in his phone \"diary\". In his room he talks to his \"imaginary\" friend Deus Ex Machina, the God of Time and Space. Deus told Yukiteru to participate in a \"Royal Battle\" with other eleven people. This\
          \
        eleven \"diary holders\" would have to kill each other and the last one standing gets to replace Deus. The diary has it unique ways to predict the future and trapped each other \"diary holders\" to a \"dead end\".\
Story=9\
The story is amazing and it keeps me watching and waiting for a new episode each week. As you watch the anime along, you'll start to ask questions and it would just drive you insane. It's fantastic how almost all diary holders had a rough past and would do anything for love, power, and vengeance. \
Art=8\
The characters is really drawn appealing and their facial reaction is perfect in every scene. But the violence, bloody, gory scenes is not scary or disgusting enough to make puke and not sleep at night. Well which is a good thing because I don't want that to happen to me especially at Sunday night since I have school and all that. :D The art is typically the one you see at most mecha anime but they made the color more lighter.\
Sound=9\
The first opening really fits the anime and probably the most \"original\" one I've ever listened to. At first I always skipped the opening because it gives me the chills but I got used to it and I totally loved it. \
Character=8\
I would give it a 9 but Yukiteru ruined it. He is the most annoying cry baby character you'll ever meet in the anime. He is one of those \"normal\" characters you'll meet in the anime while the rest are just INSANE which made them cool :D But of course they exaggerated a bit on the characters which made it  either annoying,weird,unrealistic (I know this anime is fiction but come on make the character traits more realistic or human).\
Enjoyment=10\
After watching only the first episode I can't stop watching it. I even read the manga to know what will happen next. Most of the time you'd probably be all serious, cry (a bit), or just scared.\
Overall=9\
Maybe 9.25 or 9.5. Great anime and I would recommend you to watch it. Not the kind of anime you'll see often. As you watch it, you better like NINE!!!! :) I swear she is the most interesting and attractive girl you'll ever meet in the anime. Have fun watching the anime :)\

    This is my first ever review on this site! Not a great anime to debut though...\
I'm a positive person so I'll begin with what I liked.\
The art is decent. There are scenes where you can see some weirdness but on the whole, it's quite good. It's animated well with some really good high frame rate scenes in the last few episodes. Most of the cel-shading is also pretty good and the character of Deus ex Machina is really cool to look at.\
The music is also quite good though there are many times where they just want to bash you over the head with the \"sadness\"\
          \
        or the \"loneliness\" or the \"friends-are-so-damn-important-so-even-if-you-die-we-will-remember-you\" aspects and the music here just feels cheesy. But it's a decent score but nothing noteworthy.\
Now the bad. And there is a LOT of bad.\
Firstly, the goddamned story. What. The. FUCK.\
The first episode blew me away with the sheer potential this anime possesses and the awesome concept of precognition through something as lowly as a diary. The character of Deus, the stalker Yuno, the meek and reserved Yukki, all were an excellent recipe for a show that could very well turn into and excellent sequence of chases, mind-bending twists and one-upmanship over the other contestants and a true showcase of a potentially epic battle of wits. \
Then everything slowly but surely crumbles as meaningless plot twists, useless characters, utterly unbelievable reactions and a pathetic protagonist are mixed and it ends with such an idiotic climax that I was just glad to be over with the whole damn thing. The true twist I really didn't see coming but at that point I was pretty much at my zenith of boredom leading to my reaction being just an \"oh, that happened\" instead of \"OH MY FUCKING GOD WHAAAT\".\
The diaries are incredibly idiotic and never really used as how we'd imagined. Are they used to achieve the owner's ends and successfully trick the others? Not really. What actually kills them is mostly a combination of incredibly dumb luck, bullets, knives etc. It's not the brains and the combination of will and wit that wins, but the brawn impeded by brainlessness. The formula is usually, somehow get to the opponent using the diary, face off with brawn, some touchy-feely shit and something happens to the opponent. IF it was done the first time to build the dumbass protagonist in the first few matches it would have been fine. BUT... this brings me to my next point which is - \
These characters SUCK. Holy crap, they drove me so goddamned MAD.\
What the FUCK was with Yukki? I mean, this dude NEVER EVER wants to grow up from his obvious weaknesses, his delusions, his inferiority complex, NOTHING. He's been given one of the most powerful weapons and elevated to a god among men with only a handful more who share the dias. Does he take this as an opportunity to grow as a person, learn to fend for himself and kick-ass? NOPE NOT HAPPENING. Forget kicking ass, this guy can barely defend or even think by himself. He continues to be a child till the very end, repeatedly tricked by Yuno into loving her and almost never makes a conscious decision of his own.\
And Yuno? She was as 2D a character as they come with her decidedly one-point agenda upto the very end. You may try and excuse her constant pining as being that of the yandere character she's supposed to be but this only leads to some VERY stupid decisions and some overtly protective/murderous actions. She NEVER thinks for herself or plans for the future. We are shown that she's awesome with bursts of amazing deduction but these are so unbelievable and interspersed with pure stupidity that we just call bullshit on them after the first few episodes.\
The other contestants are invariably psychopaths that should never have been selected for this position in the first place, forcing us to somehow hope Yukiteru gets the spot in the end (which was an eventuality from the start) so these psychotic fucks don't get the opportunity. Also one of the contestants being allowed in the game was highly suspect given his role and I'll never believe he would be allowed to participate.\
The other characters are equally, if not worse, criminally underdeveloped or utterly useless. I see no point in Kousuke or Mao ever being a \"major\" characters. Akise Aru was also never really fleshed out. Hinata was purely a fan service character.\
But ani, ani, what about romance, fan service, blood and gore and wholesome yandere fun? LOL seriously? If any of these elements were present in decent amounts to tone down the seriousness of the plot the I wouldn't have been this harsh on the anime. Unfortunately, the fan service is sparse, the romance is irritating and the gore is barely there. You get spouts and gushes of blood, a couple of chopped heads, some missing limbs but that's it. Having seen Elfen Lied, this is all very tame and barely stimulating.\
A pointless and meandering story, moronic characters and some truly awful pacing with random bits of humour or sentiment suddenly destroying the previous mood wreck a concept with vast potential which let me down considerably. I'm not looking back at this time wasted with any fondness.\

I found the anime story really good and enjoyable, the kind of anime that makes you watch an episode after another because it makes you curious to know what is going to happen, so if you're looking for something to make you intrigued, this would be a great option.\
There's only one negative part for me: both Yuno and Yuki are so, like SO ANNOYING to a point I almost felt like giving up\
          \
        watching it. They are the type of characters that makes you say 'oh not again' whenever they show up in the series, and since their are the main characters, sometimes it's difficult to watch they doing the same things and saying the same things over and over and over...\
Yuno is supposed to be the misterious badass girl in the anime yet she's so predictable and meh. \
If you can stand both of them, then the rest is pretty awesome, but those two really ruined what could be one of the greatest anime in this type of genre.\

    Hmm, how do I start this. Actually, I didn’t like Mirai Nikki before (while it was airing.) and placed it on hold. I was thinking, it was just the average survival game with a grand prize, so I stopped there. But that isn’t the only reason for giving it up. At that time, there were heavy spoilers everywhere, people/fans talking what’s gonna happen next, how they like the ending, what is the plot twist, and everything. Yes, it is a really popular anime and gained fans everywhere. Popularity somehow means discussion and discussion somehow means spoiler. It was stupid of me to read through them\
          \
        but in the end, I didn’t care. I liked the idea when I learned what’s going to be the ending, I kinda imagined things, maybe even enough for my own fanfiction. after some time, I gave it some thought to finish the anime. So, enough of my own thoughts, let’s proceed to the review. I minimized the amount of spoilers here to be safe.\
PLOT – 9.5/10\
The plot is neat, though what I didn’t like is they are throwing out too much mystery then suddenly explaining it towards the end. I’m sorry, my brain just couldn’t handle that much. As I said, it is neat. I didn’t really notice any plot holes or maybe I was just too hooked to the story to notice. For a survival game, I found interesting is the feeling you get from the story. It has the potential to bring out the feels in you. And yes, I admit, I cried a few times in several scenes. Also, there are a few plot twists which totally messed up my predictions in the story. I was like, what? The story is quite unique, I would say. There are many overused plots, character stories and backgrounds but this managed to stand out from them. I may have said I didn’t notice any plot holes in the story but the part I didn’t like is why did they have to face each and every contestant. I mean, there are 12 participants and one or two may have killed each other off because facing the others. Though they were able to use that effectively and I realized that the anime wouldn’t be that great if it weren’t for that. So for all the headaches, mindblown, feels, mysteries, plot twists, and everything they gave me through the plot. I gave it back a 9.5/10.\
ART – 9/10\
I like the art, yes, but I’m still not going to give it a 10/10. I don’t think the bloody scenes isn’t enough for this anime, but I know that’s just me. In fact, I’m sure that the bloody scenes were just enough, it isn’t overused and also not underused. The fight scenes were good though, I haven’t watched some good fight scenes in a while since most are quite repetitive. Mostly you get is an overpowered main character who you know would win each and every battle and sometimes (worse, always) gets away with no scratches. The way they beat the opponent changes though and I’ll give some credit for that. But this time its different, I actually got some thrill from this anime and I liked that. Also, there are 26 episodes in total, just enough for the whole story. You see lately, I feel that a manga’s potential to be a great anime is reduced when it is adapted to just a few episodes and they try to compress the story to fit the number of episodes which I think is such a waste. So anyway, I’ll give the art and animation a 9/10.\
MUSIC – 8/10\
The music is very very good, in some way. I mean, the OP definitely fits the anime and its plot. Although I can’t comment much on the ED since when it rolls, I start to think about the episode I just watched. You see, I just mentioned that the throw too much mystery at once. I try to anticipate the next events there. Anyways, before we get off topic. I think the background music during several scenes were a huge part of how it can bring out the feels. I mean, the story itself is kinda lonely, but without a great music to back it up, I don’t think it’ll end up the same. I so loved both the two OP, they bring out some excitement like somehow the adrenaline rush. It makes me active, I don’t know why. I’ll give it an 8/10.\
CAST – 7/10\
I like how they used characters with so different personalities and how they made their background story but I don’t think its great enough for a 10/10. You see, you get a main character who is always dependent. Yes, I understand how he is afraid of killing, who likes to kill anyway. Maybe me, but it isn’t allowed, so… Off topic. I don’t really like his character but he taught me some things I didn’t expect. I was thinking that if I would be the main character, I’ll get no hesitation to kill or whatsoever. I mean, when everything is THAT messed up, what choice do you get? None. But I learned that talking is important and the truth plus the reasons behind the events, will forever be hidden if we only resort to violence. In the end, I liked the main cast despite hating him before since I was like looking at a mirror. Like the pathetic hopeful dreamer I was. 9/10 if that was the only case. But I thought that, how come these people get this kind of background story and yet. Ugghh. There are some things I can’t comprehend. I mean, there are people who I know are powerful enough to win but didn’t. Pure luck or destiny maybe? Nah, it was the author’s decision. Anyway like I mentioned above, main cast meeting each of them and learning their story, was an effective plot towards the ending. Such background story is 9/10 but the cast itself is 7/10. Sorry.\
ENJOYMENT – 8/10\
Overall, I enjoyed the whole anime. It lasted in my brain for quite some time and I know for sure that the lessons and stories will be in my heart forever. Yes, I’m quite serious in that and not just being cheesy. I mean, it managed to slip into my dreams so this anime may have been special to me. I watched it continuously with such excitement and happiness so I can’t deny that I really enjoyed this anime. With all the anime that’s been aired and airing, some just leaves a special mark in history and I give this one a nice thumbs up for that along with the anime which I really enjoyed before.\

    Lets be honest. If you gave this a 10 (like I did), its either because you have been in a similar relationship as Yuki, you're in one right now, or hell, you long for a relationship like that! \
If Yuno is a 10, as far as crazy goes, my relationship in real life was like a 5 because lets be honest no one in real life could get away with what happens in this anime. I'm simply referring to the psychological state that Yuno/my ex possessed. \

In all honesty\

This is the 2nd ever anime TV series I have watched, and what a way to start off for me.\
I may be a bit biased for this TV series but what goes great for it is\
Character development: it keeps you on the edge of your seat thinking is it going to be okay? the characters are great as no character in the TV series can be seen as plain evil and take enjoyment from the \"survival game\".\
everything else does its job and keeps the standards of this show up\
the only down side of this show is that it can seem just plain ridiculous but\
          \
        just forget that the main two characters are 14 years old and its one the best shows around.\
if you like gore, violence, romance, thrillers, mysteries and a little bit of awkward comedy, this is the best show around\

    Thought I would write my first ever review and having it be one of my absolute favorite anime of all time. I will try to keep it as spoiler free as possible. I should also mention that I came across this show by accident.\
To start, the story:\
The story is pretty great. It's like the hunger games with it's own uniquity and intensity. It is an absolute manhunt, last-man-standing wins. That being said, it is action packed with a bit of romance here and there as well as a Tad of comedy and of course some feels. Everything is put together perfectly and all the characters\
          \
        are introduced at the right moment. The story was well written and always keeps you sucked in. In my experience, I could not get away from this show. You will either grow to love or hate it. It starts off at a decent pace with a weird kid with a phone diary...at least That's the first five minutes. It kicks off very quickly, jumps in, and takes off. The rest of the show wastes no time at all. Gets a little odd at the very end, but it all comes together.\
On to the art:\
I loved the art style! First Anime I saw with this kind of style. So smooth and bright. Interesting for such a dark show. It mainly got me because the way the eyes look. I feel it helps bring more character and personality to the characters. But yes, fantastic.\
As for sound:\
Meh, whatever. It's sound. Done well, slightly unique. Didn't really pay attention. If we wanna talk voice sound, I took a peek at the DUB and it made me want to throw up. As for normal sounds and the soundtrack, all good. The soundtrack was pretty sweet. The one sound that really matters is the notification sounds on everyone's phone, it helps with what the mood is at the moment and is satisfying or keeps the show at intensity.\
Them characters:\
Every character was extremely different from one another it just worked. You got a few weirdos, some psychos, a badass or two, and some normal-ish blokes. Upon fiearlier look, they fool you and then turn around and surprise you with a completely different personality than you originally met them. Keeps the show mixed up, unique, and what really makes the whole manhunt situation a whole lot better. Some get annoying and a little predictable, but it all works out and you don't really care in the end. You will have favorites though and those you will grow to hate. Then people you have no idea what to think.\
Oh the enjoyment:\
This show is extremely enjoyable. Like I said before, it's hard to peel yourself away from. Stuff is always going on and if you look away you will absolutely miss something. With things always happening, there is never a dull moment. Unexpectedly, there is a little bit of nonsense at the end of the credits in every episode that provides a little comic relief and is just great.\
Overall conclusion:\
In total, I myself give it a perfect 10/10! Like I said multiple times, never a dull moment, incredibly enjoyable, and impossible to stop watching. It's twisted and thrilling throughout and in my experience is one o only a few anime I wanted to watch again immediately after finishing. I highly recommend. To anyone, even if it isn't your cusual cup of tea, you are Sure to enjoyable it.\

    This review contains some spoilers...\
To be honest, I had high hopes for this anime. I mean, the plot gave off a Death Note vibe so I was really looking forward to all the psychological battles and witty interaction. But boy, was I dissapointed.\
The anime handles the most disgusting prospects of horror VERY poorly: from child rape, to sex between 14-year olds, to gay relationships between fourteen year olds, to death matches between 3 year olds and 14 year olds and everything else lewd concerning 14 year olds. This could have been a great aspect of the show to give it a horror vibe but 75%\
          \
        of the show is so downright comical that you can't even take things seriously. There are zombies, mask freak caling himself a hero of justice, a bombproof serial killer (wtf?), a solo \"international\" terrorist in her early 20s, a child psychopath, and whatnot. Seriously, the plot is so full of plotholes, lazy writing,absurd plot twist, and stupid scenes followed by stupid character decisions that it makes you double-check what the genre of the show is. Also, under the pretext of trying to be a seinen anime, the anime tries to offer me the boobs of 14-year olds as fan service consistently throughout the series. There is a scene where the female protagonist Yuno Gasai pees in a room, for no apparent reason than to make the viewer feel those moments as being \"deep\" and \"psychological\" And thats only one of those instances. The plot is fairy stable at first, but towards the end it gets so convoluted and made-up, it almost turns into a fairy tale.\
\
The characters are the worst part of the entire series, possibly the worst in anime history. There's this wimp called Yukiteru Amane that we have the misfortune of having to call our main protagonist, who never develops throughout the entire series. The bastard is so inconsistent in his actions that it will make you cringe and question if he has a dual personality or something. And let me tell you, the wimp doesn't mind kissing and banging a psychotic serial killer in one one moment while despising and doubting her the next. There is an instance where he tries to make friends with a girl who straight-up tried to murder him literally a minute ago. Seriously, what the hell? Undoubtedly the worst written character in anime history.\
Then comes the yandere bitch known as Yuno Gasai who has no real personality or reason. One moment she goes all out for protecting \"Yukki\"*head bursts* and the next she is trying to kill him herself. What the actual F*CK?!. She is only there to provide for some gore and entertainment, other than that she is the most annoying yandere ever.\
The rest of the characters are almost all pathetic, save for two of my personal favorites: Uryu Minene and Aru Akise who become plot devices near the end of the series.\
The series also tries to make the viewers sympathize with the serial killers and psychopaths by putting up some bullshit backstory that doesn't nearly justify their course of action. There are diary holders so twisted you will wonder if Deus is a god of idocracy to even chose them as his successors. He is a worthless god who has no regard for humanity. What a jerk.\
The soundtrack is mostly good and fits well with the scenes of the show, and I have to say the first opening is really good. The second opening as well as the endings were good enough.\
The art looks good in some instances but during action scenes it looks abslutely mediocre. The characters when thry run look like they are running on a treadmill. And sometimes the character proportions look so out of place they look like wax figures melting. However there WERE moments where the art was fun to watch.\
The series was one which was filled to the brim with potential for a good watch, but it ends up downright lame and forced. The characters are dumb as fuck, and the battles are often a total letdown. The supposed \"successors\" are so psychotic and senseless, they'd straight-up kill all humans if they ever became God. The show also implies that God can't revive a dead person with the same soul for some reasons. I mean...God? The handler of the entire Universe?? \
Overall, I believe the show would have been fairly enjoyable because it handles some aspects of seinen quite well but ended ended up being a mediocre clusterf*ck of nosensical writing and direction.",

    In my opinion; I personally love Mirai Nikki. However, I can see the flaws in it. \
First the story. It's fairly original and its unique *to my knowledge* however, it does seem to be a little rushed when it comes to certain antagonists. \
The art is decent and it can look rather beautiful at times.\
The opening's for this anime is amazing. It can capture you and get you to sing along and the scenes often have a beautiful soundtrack to match scenes. \
The characters are fairly rounded. They all have unique personalities and each one adds on to the stories plot and has unique interactions.\
          \
Overall I believe this is great; however, it does have its flaws. \

    If you are a person looking for an anime series or to view and to relax, an anime cause you many interesting and unexpected circumstances that you can not expect them to, then Mirai Nikki might be an option very suitable for you. I'm the one who came across this exciting anime series, it was great that I can become a fan of it.\
Mirai Nikki- A bold new anime to survive and maybe bring a little bit horror under the appearance of Yuno Gasai- a character that I think she is the focus of the film, one person people often call her Queen Yandere Yandere\
          \
        or something like that =))). The story is about a boy whose name is Amano and eleven others, including Juno phones owned by Deux gift called \"future diary\", they along with the diary that how to destroy ten a man left to return to the lord of time instead of Deux. The motifs of this existential anime you may have encountered a lot but with Mirai Nikki, you can see many differences. With a plot development, a normal situation like that, the author has succeeded in revealing emotions like happiness and sadness character or anger, reveals much about the past as well as their main purpose with the pursuit of this war to the end to achieve their own purposes, desires or save loved ones or their friends. Ten or twelve people with personalities and different purposes, they have come together to make up a meaningful fight and give us many profound lessons.\
However, the characters are not very many external focus and Yuno and Amano, who is considered the number one and number two. Additionally, one might say more about Akise Aru, a character began to appear from the middle part of the film, he's pretty cool and the focus of all attention of the fanboy and fangirl when love with Amano and the Deux created as an observer. Amano - main main, a boy who has a habit of keeping a diary on your phone and record what happens around himself, he is quite lonely and has no friends. During the war, Amano must be a partner to bring you many fail because the season is almost over the film, he showed a face frail and useless, even as tears, indecisive. He very easily deceived and taken advantage of as a puppet, makes much time took away the appeal of the film. But not so that we are not talking about the good side of Amano Yukiteru, since his parents lost by certain intervention in the war, he had a completely different face, strong more, more sly and gradually realized that to survive and achieve their own aspirations, he must accept the sacrifice of others. Contrary to Yuki, Yuno Gasai, viewed as Yuki's lover as well as the most formidable opponents of the war and who cooperate with him, is an intelligent and sensitive person. Yuno had an extremely traumatic past, she was a wealthy family adoptions but they too draconian and forced her into doing what they want, if not locked and a safety cage and day starved or difficulty swallowing food diets. Her life day and night all hell but Yuno does not hate his family. On days like that, she was born and psychological disorders hand down her parents killed accidentally and uncontrollably. Since then, she lost all purpose in life as well as their own dreams until Yuki gave her a belief in the aspirations of the schools surveyed. Since then, she vows to stand by and defend him before Yuki difficulties in life. And Akise Aru, which is just a character created for the purpose Deux observation but he was gradually get emotional and become a real person, beyond the control of the lords of time. And a few other minor characters such as the Friends of Yuki, Akise and Yuno, No. 9 Uryuu Minene or guys under his policeman of No. 4, they appear multiple times and cause unnecessary conflict also such situations and feelings cooperation irony and unexpected but just as easy to attract the attention of you-people who follow the film.\
Front image of a action movie is extremely important, investment author quite thoroughly and extremely diverse, characters they bring personality and different characteristics, no two people are alike, each person bears the features, including their diaries, all with bloody action, facial expressions and the context of the battle that Yuno and Yuki experiencing really makes me feel see happy, satisfied and probably you too.\
As for sound, the OP and ED both extremely great, the voice actors are very well reflected his role in evoking the personality of the characters, especially Yuno and Yukiteru.\
In general, overall rating, I can see this is an anime worth watching and it is not too terrible. If as you would expect in a little work slightly bring horror and action but taking supernatural elements as well as special cast the Mirai Nikki is actually a pretty great choice for you. I can guarantee that you will have uttered one sentence: \"Oh it was great!\" for that view.\

    WARNING: This is a biased review from a girl who marathon-ed Mirai Nikki during her two depression days of August 2015.\
Maybe my review premise is a little over-the-top. But the thing is, I just haven't watched any anime in a long time, and when I did, the first one that grabbed my attention was this - Mirai Nikki.\
And, boy, did I get hooked!\
You'll see a lot of memes about Mirai Nikki, with I think the most popular being: Gasai Yuno - The Original Overly Attached Girlfriend. I'm not really sure but ever since this anime was shown, I think more people became interested in Yandere\
          \
        characters. Suffice to say, the anime is a masterpiece that have created trends.\
But what to expect in Mirai Nikki if you hadn't seen it yet?\
Well, in that note, you need to prepare yourselves for, just, EVERYTHING.\
Story: 10\
I did not look at the summary of Mirai Nikki before watching it. It's a little embarrassing but the only push I needed was a random picture of the main characters kissing with tears brimming in their eyes.\
And when I did watch it...\
Man, was it a once-in-a-lifetime ride.\
You'll find almost everything in Mirai Nikki - Pyschological, Fantasy, Romance, Comedy, Supernatural, Thriller, Suspense, Mystery, Gore, Drama, Action ... just, whirlwind of emotions compressed in 26 episodes, and 1 OVA.\
I'll try to give you a heads up about all these, but really, there is simply not enough premise that can prepare anyone for the roller-coaster that is Mirai Nikki.\
Let's dive in.\
You'll first be introduced to a Dark Fantasy kind of theme where Yuki has this boring life and all he does is create a random diary in his cellphone, and he \"thought\" he created  Deux, the God of Time, whom he converse with from time to time. There's a good summary for this, so I won't explain everything. What I'm only trying to say is that the first part introduced the theme of Dark Fantasy...\
Then comes Suspense and Action, when he and Yuno engaged to their first battle...\
Then...\
Everything else.\
At the middle part, you'll get a taste of mystery and psychological with Yuno's past. From then on, everything in the story shifted. And from time to time, it includes comedic scenes for a little breather in between intense scenes.\
You'll be surprised by how bold this anime is with issues of rape, or torture, or kidnapping - how unafraid the creators were in showing EVERYTHING with no censorship, which are easily shut down by other animes.\
You'll find yourself wanting to watch the next episode, and when you did, it's just not enough. So you'll watch the next, and then the next, and the next, without stopping...\
Until you've surprised yourself that you are already nearing the end.\
And by the end, you'll weep your eyes out over the dramatic ending (at least that's what happened to me), because you know everything miraculously worked out well, and that all the characters had the happy endings they deserve. Happy endings (albeit slightly sad for this one) are never cliches for me.\
And when that last second hit the mark signalling the series' ending, you'll want to watch the OVA to satisfy the closure you'll be seeking.\
(It kind of feels like every questions were answered, and every scattered piece of the jigsaw puzzle finally reunited to create one perfect image.)\
And when all these are over, you'll be afraid, not because of the anime's contents, but because you know it has spoiled you forever against any other cheap, stereotypical anime.\
And you know it's a long shot to find anything better than (or even at par with) this.\
*Sighs*\
(I know my review contains a lot of exaggerations, that's why I had that warning above as my premise...)\
Art: 10\
I think the art perfectly suits the anime's genres, and theme. The character designs stand out, and the execution of action/suspense scenes were perfect. And for me, if those requirements were fulfilled, then they are more than enough reasons to merit this anime with a ten.\
Sound: 10\
When you see the opening song, you know this anime is going to be great... and you won't be disappointed.\
Every background music in the scenes fit perfectly with its theme.\
Character: 10\
What I liked about the characters of Mirai Nikki is how original they were.\
Gasai Yuno - a trend setter for Yandere types. She's LITERALLY crazy. She's a badass. She kills people, all for Yukiteru's sake. She's a dual character - an ally and a foe. You have never seen anyone like her yet.\
Amano Yukiteru - weakling at first, but you can relate to him. In my own opinion, he's a good manipulator, not just of events, but of Yuno. He knows how to work his way to stay alive (which is the whole point of the anime - a survival game). And he became incredibly badass towards the end. But before achieving the level of badassness, you're first introduced to all his fears, and that, I think, makes him very human. As a viewer, I felt that his reactions were very realistic.\
I know many people criticize Yuki, but I feel that the way he was made was perfect for this anime. Sure, Yuno is one of those characters you will never forget, but I think Yuki, who you could easily forget, is the one who plays the game cleverly well. Because you can forget Yuki, he can work behind the scenes, and move the plot in the direction that he wanted without anyone noticing.\
Others - For an anime of only 26 episodes, I think the other characters played their roles well. Each of them brought different flavors to the game. And that there makes this anime a masterpiece.\
Enjoyment: 10\
Come on, this is an obvious score.\
Overall: 10\
It doesn't take a genius to compute that my overall score is a PERFECT TEN.\
Watching this was a worthwhile ride, indeed.\
(After watching Mirai Nikki, I opened myself to other animes, and that's a fine example of an anime with a great influence to its audience.)\

    Mirai Nikki, when i first heard of this show i expected it to be very similar to Eden of the East, and thus i expected to have a boring plot that i had seen before.\
How wrong I was! Mirai nikki keeps you on the edge of your seat constantly, it has an outstanding plot that takes you on a roller-coaster of a ride. The emotion between the characters is a masterpiece, and in general it was very well thought out. Every week i have been anticipating the next episode, staying up late just to watch it. Its kept me hooked and interested all the way,\
          \
        and now that its nearly at an end im rather sad that such a great show is going to end. But by jove im enjoying all the loose ends they are tying up, i just hope they don't leave any sort of gaps in the story that leaves you guessing.\
I don't foresee a second series, and to be honest that is a good thing. This show will end perfectly at the 26th episode, and you will most likely feel very fulfilled.\
The only thing that prevents me from giving it an overall 10 is the gore, im not a great fan of it. But im sure most others out there enjoy it, so im just being a little bias there.\

    Mirai Nikki. One of those anime, when action is unpredictable twisted. \
If you were annoyed by Orihime's \"Kurosaki-kun\" than one of main characters, Yuno, will annoy you too. But less than Orihime at all...\
In the beggining you are thinking \"this and this will happen\". than BANG! Something else happens. The story is so developed, and it's really good! Mirai Nikki is very interesting; there's a lot of horror, gore, romance, but there's comedy too. \
For the first you're thinking it's simple anime about shy boy and loud girl. But then there're more characters, more clues, more cases. I think it's pretty easy to cry here.\
        I'm sure this review isn't good at all, but I feel so confused after watching this anime I had to tell you about it.I wasn't expected THAT kind of feeling. Like this feeling after watching \"Clannad\". You're sad, but than happy. This is really good anime and I recommend it ^^\

    In my honest opinion, Mirai Nikki is almost perfect.\
It has just the right balance of action, suspence, drama, romance and of course violence.\
Gasai Yuno, the female \"protagonist\" if you could call her that, is easily my favourite character in any show ever. The story is full of suspense and plot twist that I could some people disliking however I love it.\
The sound track is brilliant from the First opening, to the epic moment songs, to the second closing song.\
Most of the time the animation is fantastic, however at certain times it lacked a certain something, but that should not detract from your enjoyment.\
If there were\
          \
        any show I could recommend any show more, I have not seen it yet, I urge you to at least give Mirai Nikki a try, and with an english dub coming soon there is no reason why you shouldn't try it. \

    This review is spoiler-free\
\
Mirai Nikki started off great, i started watching when it was about 13 episodes in. \
As the episodes moved on I noticed a dramatic drop in quality. The characters slowly became terrible, save for Yuno. The characters were not believable at all. Yukki feels like a bad Shinji ripoff, but instead of having depth and character like Shinji, he really is just a little bitch. His abnormal tendency to forgive people who were trying to kill him 5 minutes prior is painful. Instead of giving the impression that he's desperate for affection, it just makes him impossible to like. His sudden personality\
          \
        change to a terribly cliche, over confident \"shounen jump badass\" made me cringe, and even Yuno was awful in these stages. The direction of the anime seemed childish, like they were trying to be cool by adding action and plot twists. The art wasn't too bad, though it wasn't the best either. The OPs are fairly representative of the quality of the show. The first complemented the series and was actually very good. The second half's OP had such bad engrish i was embarrassed to watch it. Each week after about episode 16 left me disappointed, expecting the great stuff I saw in the earlier episodes that i loved.\
After watching the whole series i felt like a had been taken advantage of. I realise that lots of people will disagree with this review, claiming Mirai Nikki is \"badass\", but to be fair, lots of people like Naruto. I really am not trying to offend people, other than Naruto fans, but it had to be said.\
overall, i would say, if you're looking for anime that feels like shounen jump while being more violent, with sexy Yuno, this might be for you. overall i wouldn't reccomend it\

    Diaries that can predict the future in vastly different ways, a winner takes all survival game, 12 psychopaths competing for the role of god, and a stalker girl that refuses to leave the main character alone. These are the  main themes of Mirai Nikki, and these are also both the show's greatest strengths, and it's greatest weaknesses.\
Yukiteru Amano is a quiet, 14 year old middle school student who borders on being anti-social. One day, he finds out that the journal he keeps on his cell phone is already filled in for the day, predicting the events that happen around him. He also comes to\
          \
        find out though that Deus, the being he thought was his imaginery friend, is actually god, and that he has been thrown into a last man standing survival game in which the winner claims the title of the new god. Couple that with the fact that a crazy, murderous stalker who also happens to be a player has fallen in love with him, and you have a general idea of the premise of Mirai Nikki.\
\
Story\
The storyline in Mirai Nikki is one of the best aspects of the show. If you couldn't tell from the description above, Mirai Nikki has a setup that just pulls you in, offering a great premise to get you excited about the events to come. That said, it needs to be understood that this survival game isn't one along the lines of say \"Eden of the East\", where the game is more of a backdrop for a though provoking story. Mirai Nikki's survival game is kill or be killed, no exceptions. The show prefers to just let cool things happen even if they aren't properly explained, which is a blessing and a curse.\
On the one hand, it makes for some truly enjoyable moments, but it does often leave you with the impression that the show just doesn't care if the events make sense, leaving you with the impression it was just rushed or downright ignored. But again, if your willing to just raise your suspension of disbelief and turn your brain off while your watching it, there is a lot of action and cool moments to justfiy watching.\
As far as pacing goes, it moves at a very nice rate, keeping things interesting and ensuring that it never takes to long on one certain thing, keeping you entertained in the process. The ending is also surprisingly interesting, being a bit complex and a bit difficult to wrap your head around at first, but it is quite clever once you figure it out and makes the last 3-4 episodes some of the most enjoyable in the series. That said, you should probably check the last chapter of the manga after finishing the show, as their are about 10 pages or so that were unanimated, and it's definitely worth seeing them as they clear up a few questions.\
Ultimatley, the story is very enjoyable with a few twists and turns throughout it to keep you engaged. I doens't always take the time it should to explain things to the viewer but with the fast pace and cool moments you'll hardly have time to notice. Ultimately though, the story is brought down the most by it's characters.\
\
Characters\
I'll put it bluntly, the characters are probably the worst thing about Mirai Nikki. For a show revolving around 12 people vying for the role of god, the characters must be interesting and engaging in order for the seutp to work. Thankfully, not all the characters are bad. As most of the characters have some form of psychological problem, some of them truly are interesting. Such as a blind man who dresses up like a power ranger acting as an agent of justice, a little boy whose parents fight, and a terrorist who might not be as bad as she first seems to be. The sad thing is, not all the characters are that good, and most of the tones that are good are quickly killed off and never brought up again.\
It's not that all the other characters are bad per se, it's just that despite the show trying to gibe them interesting backstories and trying to make you care, most just come off as boring and you never really care about them. For a show all about a game in which only one will survive, having likeable, interesting characters is a necessity, but Mirai Nikki fails to deliver on this in all but a few cases.\
Also important in defining the characters are each of their future diaries. Each player in the survival game had a diary they keep, and each one fills them in on future events in various different ways. Some are simple, such as telling the user what events happen around him, or another that details what will happen to someone the user is close too. Some of these future diaries get a bit bizarre though, and there's one later in the show that allows other future diaries to be made from it. It's an interesting concept, but it's never explained exactly how this can work, and the show just doesn't seem to care that it makes no sense.\
Despite a few leaps in logic such as that though, the future diaries are a key part of Mirai Nikki, and it's always interesting to find out what diary a certain person has, and how it can be used to help them kill the other players.\
The worst offender as far as characters go is sadly the main man himself, Yukiteru. He whines, complains, and cries all to often, making him just a constant annoyance to the viewer. It's understandable for him to be afraid at first, after all, he's just been thrown into this crazy survival game and now has a crazy murderous woman following him around, but the problem is that he never grows throughout the show. He does have some moments of courageousness, but he never grows from them, despite the fact that after every one it seems like a great chance to develop his character.\
There to pick up the slack though is Yuno, that crazy, murderous stalker I mentioned earlier. Yuno is probably the best character in the show, seeming sweet and innocent, and just when you think she's not so bad, something is revealed about her which takes you back to her true nature of being a crazy, murderous, psycho, and she is one of the few characters to have truly good development. Over the course of the show you will learn more and more about her, making you wonder what her true motives really are.\
\
Art\
There really isn't much to say about the art and animation in this show. It's certainly not bad or anything, but it's nothing to write home about either. The colors look nice and the character designs are alright, nothing spectacular though. You can tell some shortcuts were taken at certain points, but the animation does get a noticeable bump near the end of the series as most shows do, so it's not so bad. All in all the art in Mirai Nikki is alright, it gets the job done but doens't break any good ground. There is some nicely animated action sequences, so I'll give it that.\
Sound\
As with the animation, the sound is so-so. All the background music sets the mood well, and there are a few stand out tracks, but it's not the best soundtrack I've heard. The openings and endings though I though were quite nice, most of them giving some sort of look at the 12 players in the survival game, and they set the mood of the show well.\
\
Enjoyment\
In terms of pure enjoyment, Mirai Nikki may be one of the most purely enjoyable anime I've seen. It's not deep or thought provoking, but it is a lot of fun to watch and downright entertaining. There are just so many memorable moments in this show that are either really cool, \"epic\", or even a few touching ones. Even if you don't like a lot of things about the show, you'll be hard pressed not to find a multiple moments in the show that bring a smile to your face, as there are quite an abundance of them, particuarly when the show really gets going in it's second half.\
\
Overall\
All in all, how much you like Mirai Nikki will be determined by how willing you are to overlook a few cases of things going unexplained and a few plot holes for the sake of high adrenaline, \"awesome\" moments. If your like me than you'll be able to look past some of those flaws and just enjoy it for what it is, which is basically just a fast paced battle royal featuring a cast of psychopaths using diaries that can predict the future to kill each other.A few of these characters being very well done, where as some fall very short.\
Either way, as long as you are willing to look past these faults, Mirai Nikki is a very enjoyable expirence with a story that is surprsisngly good and only bogged down by a lack of great characters. I would reccomend this show to anyone who likes a show that doesn't force them to think to hard, and just gives them something enjoyable, adrenaline packed, and with a few twists and turns throughout.\
If the characters had been better than I would have probably given this show a 9, but as they are one of the most important parts of the show and they just aren't as good as they need to be, I had to drop my overall score to an 8.\

One of few favorite manga/anime's were Death Note, Code Geass, Gantz, Neon Genesis Evangelion and few others about young character, far from being able of directing their own destiny, obtaining the immense power that is also hardly described in terms of strength, agility or intelligence.

          \
        the audience knows that redemption may be achieved only through proceeding this, often gory, heart breaking, full of sacrifices and martyr path. \
Story in Mirai Nikki is no different, and it's audience shouldn't expect nothing else but having their minds twisted on this mad journey and hearts tugged at the cruelty of faith. Unfortunately if bright enough to foreseen but never to prevent the events. \
I'm from Europe and my standards may seem different but going through the list of 10/7/7/7/10/9 i consider the story very unique, even more as the majority of the problem escalates even from Godly grasp, but let's leave it as that, i wouldn't wish to spoil too much. Art should be set to 6/10 but i gave it a higher note, purely out of combat at the end of the series, the part that annoyed me the most were Chibi characters, which were successfully ruining the seriousness of the show. Sound was good, often i had a feeling that they could try harder, but it was actually acceptable to listen, and i didn't mind listening to credits at times. Characters were pretty average, actually the only characters which death made me care enough to shed tears died at the end of the show and concerning family matter (which hero? You'll see in show).  Enjoyment? Yes, very! Watching one episode made me crave to watch seven of them at once, so i eat the whole anime in three attempts. It's like a candy You never have enough of. It's much less complicated then Death Note and Code Geass, but it's still worth seeing, and to some even favoring it. \
Good Luck at watching this Anime, i'm giving it a 9/10, and a must see for everyone who enjoys mind games.",

    Mirai Nikki, in all honesty, was a pretty bad show. The beginning of the show wasn't that bad. As the show continued on, it tried mixing in a lot of things which eventually made the story a complete mess. It felt like they were adding in random shit as it went along and was really nothing but senseless fighting.\
Yukiteru was a really bad character and got on my nerves a lot. I understand how being in a situation like that would leave someone frightened, but he pretty much let Yuno do his dirty work for the entirety of the show. He was also really stupid.\
(spoiler)\
When\
          \
        his dad murdered his mom and left him on a building to die, he forgave him for all of it for some stupid cliche childhood promise of looking through a fucking telescope to stare at some stars.\
(/spoiler)\
Art:\
The art was average. It wasn't bad, and it wasn't good at the same time. The animation of Deus was quite different from everyone else though.\
Sound:\
I really liked the first theme song. It was a lot better than the second one. The voices kind of matched the characters (especially Yuki for being a huge faggot).\
Character:\
There really wasn't much character development. This is mainly because everyone gets killed of too quickly. Minene and Keigo are the only exceptions to this.\
Enjoyment:\
This show was somewhat enjoyable. I liked Minene. Everything else was honestly for the shits and giggles.\
Overall: 3\
This review is kind of all over the place because I watched this show a long time ago but just now decided to write a review about it.\

    Mirai Nikki. A pretty popular anime where the female mc may be more popular than the show itself. It's a love hate anime where you either love it or want to burn it. I so wanted to burn it. Are there spoilers in this review? Maybe.\
Story- 4\
The idea of a survival game wasn't really original but it's not really overused. But the idea of having diaries that can tell the future was a bit intriguing. The way the story was executed was fucking poor though. The first mc introduced is Yukiteru Amano (aka Yuki) who is a 2nd year in middle school that has no\
          \
        friends, but spends his time recording his surroundings in his phone. In his imagination, he talks to Deus Ex Machina, the god of time and space,  and their servant Mur Mur. One day, he finds out that the entries in his phone have already been written. It was the beginning of the day and the entries were about things that were to happen a few minutes or hours later. He uses this as a way to get around school and avoid trouble. That was his future diary. And then, the second mc is introduced. It's Gasai Yuno. You know, the poster girl of Mirai Nikki that apparently everyone loves who has crazy eyes and pink hair with ribbons. She is obsessed with Yukiteru (or as he likes to call him 'Yuki!!') and the viewers find out that she herself has a future diary that's all about what Yukiteru will do every ten minutes--it doesnt matter if she's with/near him or not, she will get entries about him no matter what. She confesses her love for him and after protecting him from a serial murderer who's been targeting Yukiteru, they meet Deus Ex Machina and learn that they are in a survival game with 10 other people where they all have to kill each other in order to gain position as the new god of space and time. Sounds interesting, but as the anime goes on, the whole thing becomes a mess.\
Art-6\
There's nothing special about the art, but it was pretty consistent. It wasn't like Kyoto where there were sparkling eyes and cherry blossoms everywhere. Nor was it SHAFT with head tilts every five seconds. It was mediocre, but I do appreciate that the quality didnt go up and down from good to shitty.\
Sound-9\
This is the only good thing about the anime. The OPs and EDs are very good and catchy. It really went along with the whole horror, [psychological, thriller theme.\
Characters-1\
The characters were so pathetic. This was the worst part of the whole anime.\
Yukiteru Amano- He is the biggest fuckboy in anime HISTORY probably. That might be going a bit far, but that's how i see. For about 95% of the anime, he is cowering behind Yuno as she does all the dirty work for him. I mean, I know he was a middle schooler who was just placed into a survival game, but can he not cry out every 5 seconds it gave me headaches. He's screaming and crying most of the time, and is gullible as hell. First, you make him weak, and you gotta add gullible too? Too much. The good thing that he was no generic anime hero like Kirito from SAO or Tatsuya from Mahouka, but that's also the bad thing about him. It's as if the writers didn't know about something called a 'realistic character'. It's either they're a fuckboy or a 'flawless' and dull hero. And by realistic character, I mean make them have internal conflicts that they actually SOLVE, and also have them become strong internally and physically without bullshit. His character had no development and even when there was 'development', he acted like a cool 'badass' for 3 episodes and then went back to crying. It was so laughable....welp they tried. But what's even worse is the fact that he's so forgiving. Being a forgiving person is an incredible trait; it helps you grow as a person. But Yukiteru was so forgiving I couldn't believe it. His ability to forgive was only annoying and of course did no good for his character. You could kill his whole family and then say you love him and stab someone for him and then he'd go from hiding in the corner to worshiping you again...that was unbelievable too. His feelings were really confusing too; by the end of the anime, I was questioning all his feelings and choices because I couldn't believe how stupid and weird he was. But they probably made his character this way so that there'd be a purpose to bring in Yuno.\
Yuno Gasai-  Psychically cute I guess. Total badass who can kill without regret or moment of doubt. That's all she is. A 'yandere'. People said that they only enjoyed the show because of her which was not the case for me. Watching her killing people was only enjoyable if I didn't really like the character, but everything else about Yuno was terrible. She was a 14 year old who dedicated her life to another 14 year old who couldn't even decide what to eat on his own. She was selfish and annoying; she couldn't even let Yuki do what he wanted to do, like have any other friend who wasn't her. She only thought about her own feelings which showed that she wasn't really in love with him--idk what she was but that is not love. I mean, drugging your crush and trying to seduce him in just your undergarments while you make his close classmates watch him be taken advantage of? Totally selfish and unnecessary. What she did to Yuki was not cute at all and everytime she showed up and screamed 'Yuki!!' I cringed and wanted to die. Which was every fucking second. She made me incredibly uncomfortable and I don't care what she did to herself at the end of the series. I still believe that she never loved Yuki and just liked the idea of taken advantage of someone. Gross person. (Oh yeah, her yandere act stopped entertaining me after a few episodes)\
Side characters- Only two out of the like 50 side characters were memorable: Uryuu Minene and Akise Aru. Though Uryuu was a pretty chill and cool person, there were some things about her that I never understood. Like becoming friends with the person who took out her left eye. They basically tried to make her into a basic textbook tsundere which I thought was a bit disappointing. She's still one of my faves nonetheless. But Akise Aru was such a good character. He deserved more screen time than anyone. He was clever and mysterious and just such a good character. He wasn't really relatable just like everyone else in the series, but how interesting he was was more than enough to make him likable. Everyone else wasn't really likable or memorable, and although a lot of them had tragic stories in order for them to maybe be memorable, they weren't. One question I had though was why they never focused on Eleven--the creator of the whole future diary idea. He was important as hell, yet he didn't get as much screentime as needed.\
Enjoyment-4\
The beginning was a bit interesting, but everything became such a mess as it went on. The end was interesting, but it was such bullshit that they had to make an OVA a year later to finally calm everyone down. I still wasn't satisfied.\
Overall-2\
I would never recommend this to someone. I'm not that cruel to do that...even if i hated them. This anime is not worth anyone's time...unless you love yanderes and useless characters and fillers then go ahead and be my guest.",

    This show....THIS SHOW! Like holy crap. I gotta admit the first time I saw this on I thought it was gunna be garbage. I'm sorry but I was not a major fan of blood animes. If there was mass murder shown or limbs and violent acts happening then I would usually step aside. That kinda stuff just leaves a mark on your day but I noticed some online buddies talking about this and said hey give it a shot. So now I'm telling you. WATCH IT! Trust me it gets intense. I could not wait to watch the next episode every time and they dont\
          \
        mess around. They pretty much dive right in all the time to plot and stories and it feels like your getting dragged around by your hand like poor Yukii was in this show. The charcters are great. I loved them all even the minor ones. The scenes where amazing, the plot and mystery gets you thinking and its just all around good. A little side note is If you like Bakuman, you might recognize a certain little song during some parts of the show. Good stuff. All in all I heavily recommend this show. It is now on my list as \"You know Yuno?\" along with the ToraDora effect and Angel Beats Syndrome. =] Hope you enjoy as much as I did and I await your responses. hahahahah\

    *Warning: This review may contain spoilers and is actually a rant*\
Mirai Nikki is yet another anime with extremely interesting premise that completely wasted its Potential. It's about 12 people who have to fight against each other until only one is left with help of diaries (usually phones).\
I'll start with the easiest things to write. The Animation in this anime seems really weird to me, the character designs are incredibly weird, bold and sometimes the character movement looks ridiculous. The colour palette is full of too bright and shiny colours which ruin the atmosphere (why couldn't they use darker colours?). Both opening and Ending themes by\
          \
        Yuusei Teikoku and Faylan are simply very catchy and great songs and I find myself listening to them sometimes even now. The background music and voices are however average at best. (With exception of 5th's voice, which makes me want to punch kittens.)\
Now the characters:\
-1st, Yukiteru Amano is one of the most hated anime characters in recent anime history and is basically product of recent anime trend of pussy protagonists usually protected by insane girls (e.g. Ganta Igarashi, Shuu Ouma and that Accel World fatass, but the first real one is Shinji Ikari). At first I didn't know why every body hated him (C'mon, he's 14 year old, you would be scareed too!), but the thing is that even though some characters like Jacuzzi Splot are crybabies, they become stronger over time or grow balls when it's needed, but Yukiteru never does! He's always the same stupid pussy who never learns from his mistakes and tries too hard to save everyone and ends up killing lots of people. But that's not the worst thing! What absolutely pissed me off was when his father betrayed him several times and killed his mother and father told him it was for his good and wanted to see the stars with him and Yuki forgave him like nothing happened! WHAT THE ACTUAL F_!:$ô,cK?!?!\
-2nd, Yuno Gasai is probably the reason why you're watching this show, she's a psycho girl obsessed with Yuki and a part of the trend of yandere characters, I honestly don't like her because she's absolutely braindead and doesn't think about anything other than Yuukii and killing everybody (and everything) that comes close to him. Lame.\
-3rd, Takao Hiyama is absolutely stupid and irrelevant character who dies in the first episode and has incredibly ridiculous outfit.\
-4th, Keigo Kurusu is the most important side character of the 1st half of the show, he's a detective with ridiculous hair and incredibly indecisive.\
-5th, Reisuke Houjou is one of the most annoying characters I've seen in a while, he's a 5-year old boy who's extremely selfish and he's got access to lethal weapons which even most adults don't.\
-6th, Tsubaki Kasugano is just a whiny insane bitch. (Even though it's not really her own fault.)\
-7th, Ai Mikami and Marco Ikusaba are a boring girl who throws knives and a douchebag with the stupid haircut.\
-8th, Kamado Ueshita is a character with arguably the 2nd most powerful diary and the ugliest character design I've seen in some time. Even though she's powerful, she is irrelevant to story herself and dies absolutely stupid way.\
-9th, Minene Uruyuu is the only diary holder that I kind of like for her craziness and liking to blow up stuff, but that doesn't mean much.\
-10th, Karyuudo Tsukishima is a crazy man obsessed with dogs (probably some PETA activist?) who dies almost immediately after he is introduced.\
-11th, John Balks, the most important character of the 2nd half (is it just me or does he look like a Jew?) who is obsessed with power. Meh.\
-12th, Yomotsu Hirasaka is a totally braindead character who is blind and pretends to be a superhero who dies absolutely stupid death even though he knows he would.\
Other Characters:\
-Deus Ex Machina and Murmur, almighty God of time and space with terrible hairstyle (how come he doesn't know the winner of the game, he could have spared the lives of all the stupid people who senselessly died) and the most annoying loli I've ever seen with some retarded comedy specials.\
-Aru Akise,  The only character I really liked, even though he is a Near ripoff and Yaoi fangirls fanservice character, but he's at least kind of smart unlike everybody else.\
-Ouji Kousaka, retarded douchebag.\
-Hinata Hino, another useless girl.\
-Mao Nonosaka. If Akise was fanservioce for yaoi fangirls, this girl was just a stupid fanservice for yuri fanboys\
-Kurou Amano, Throw. him. into. FIRE. I so wanted to see this guy die violently.\
-Rea Amano, Yuki's mother who obviously doesn't give a damn what her son is doing so she just designs some (eroge?) games. (probably PS3 exclusives)\
-Masumi Nishijima, another police officer who's in love with Minene, also useless. (why the hell am i writing about him?)\
The story basically consists of lots of interesting but incredibly lame and extremely anticlimactic twists. (Take the death of the 11th for example.) But there is just something that keeps you watching it even though it makes mostly no sense.\
The thing that makes absolutely no sense is that since 1st killed 3rd everyone is just going after him, which seems really stupid. more \"free for all\" approach would have been welcome. There is also some stupid forced romance.\
And the conclusion totally reminds me of Madoka Magica because it uses that Deus Ex Machina Time-leaping bullcrap again. As much as I disliked both Eden of the East endings, they were still better than this crap.\
To sum it up, Mirai Nikki is dumb fun, it is bad, but if you turn of your brain, you might enjoy this.\

    This review won't have spoilers maybe just a bit introduction for the anime, its my first one ever. I will accept every critic, so please send me a PM with it ^^ I did it because it is my favourite anime. I fell in love with this anime since the first chapter, it is one of the few animes that I liked since the first one, and I didnt stop loving it.\
Mirai Nikki tells the story of a high schooler boy named as Yukiteru, he's not very social and he doesn't have friends. He is a boy who just walks and does his normal life\
          \
        while he takes notes of everything he sees in his diary.He has his own world where he daydreams, and one day a  weird thing happens on one of his day dreams, since that moment his life will totally change.His normal life will become a survival game, the prize of the winner is becoming god of time and space.\
Will he survive?\
Mirai Nikki is a psychological story with some love and action. The story starts when his diary changes into a magic one that makes him know what will happen to him in the future.Later, he finds out that there are other eleven \"players\" more with their own diaries.He discovers that his classmate, a very cute girl named as Gasai Yuno,owns a diary too, stalks him insanely and its totally in love with him and he totally misses the reason why she feels like that. On that moment, their story will just be started!\
Story -> 9 I cant give 10 to this story for a just silly thing that you might discover if you see the full anime, this story is totally NOT BORING, I saw all the anime on 2 days and a half, I was awake until 5 am watching it. This serie doesnt contain fanservice at all, the story shows too how can people change when their life is between death/life , you can guess so many things if you look at it with care, its not like, WOW HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN, all has reasons, and I think the story is totally awesome\
Art -> 10 I am a boy that cant see the anime if he hates the art, this is totally different, the art is so good, the backgrounds are very real, and every person has a meaning in the story, they dont waste space, if I cant give 10 to this one I dont know what are my requirements to that 10.\
Sound -> 10 I really dont know how to valuate so much this part but just I have to recognise that this opening and ending are on my 5 preferred ones, while the anime is running there are some musics that totally fits in and makes you enjoy even more, good anime needs good sounds, this anime has it.\
Character -> 10 Totally 10, Amano starts being a coward, the one who needs to be protected and covered by everyone, and ends with Amano taking hard decisions by himself, risking his life, and just hearing at him talking, you notice is totally a different Amano, he just grew up while we watched the anime. Gasai , I feel bad for her... because of some things, anyways, Gasai Yuno is the cutest girl of all animes, you can totally feel like \"awwww\" with her and in other moments you can feel like \"OH SHET\" you never know what will she do, you can be scared, you can feel bad for her, you can be angry at her, but in the end, she is totally an awesome person and its crazy for the person he loves, she is just too paranoic because some traumas she had... Almost all charactes have an unique personality, and not the mainstream one.\
Enjoyment -> 10 Just this, I am the boy who NEVER NEVER READS MANGA, I just watch anime, I am that lazy, Mirai Nikki made me start reading it, I never never felt bored with the serie, it is totally awesome.\
Overall -> 10 Why does this anime doesnt deserve a 10 for few mistakes? Oh common, this anime is the best I've ever seen, so many people can say whatever they want about it. I love it, I am in love with Mirai Nikki , and I totally recommend it for all the people.\
This review might have so many mistakes, so as I said, I would like to get some PMs from you to help me improving it, thanks for reading and enjoy Mirai Nikki, hope at least this was helpful for you",

    This is one seriously hard anime to review because I feel like I watched 3 different anime. The show has some very serious tone and theme problems, and at no point in time did it feel like this show came into it's own. \
The premise behind this show is a survival game w/ 12 players, all of whom armed with magical fortune telling devices. I'm an absolute sucker for this genre. And this one sounds like it's really set up well. Thoughtful, bloody, and mature... I picked it up hoping for some serious cat and mouse mind games.\
Unfortunately, it's a lazy show. I was hoping\
          \
        for some really cool deductions with the main character trying to find out who owns the Future Diaries, but 99% of the time, the owners just announce themselves to the protagonists. They rarely even go into detail about how these Diary Holders even found the protagonist. Very disappointing. The ending tries to get clever, and it could have been, but that laziness creeps in and they cheat by changing a few key characters and their motivations. Hard to go into detail without spoiling. \
Well how about the conflicts? The mind games they set up (some, rather elaborately), are usually trumped with simple violence almost always coming from the always crazy terrifying character Yuno, who possesses the impossible gift of always being able to see through other ppl's schemes. Seriously, it's not that she has an uncanny gift for foiling their enemies plans... she has an IMPOSSIBLE gift. One only attainable through lazy writing. \
The tones shift wildly from super serious cat-and-mouse, to super violent blood fest, to high school romance, to childish cutesy shonen comedy nonsense. There's one scene where a one eyed villian, who in a previous episode bombed a junior high school, get into a super cutesy fight with a super cutesy little girl (who's a god) after she messes up her hair style. At any given time, I have no idea when things are going to take a turn down WTF road. Also, on a side note, I could have definetly dealt with less fan service. Not that this one was aggregious (I'm looking at you No Game No Life). I just love anime, and everytime we have to sit through a high school girl in her panties, we go back 3 steps in the fight of making anime mainstream. It alienates people!\
As for themes? Nothing overarching as I can see it. Maybe something to do with the timidity of the main character holding him back from living a nice life?  \
The ensemble characters are great and varied, and there were definitely a few surprises in them, but unfortunately, the main story is bogged down with an insufferable, whiny mess of a main character. Yukkii does nothing but whine at his allies, they usually fix his mess, and that wouldn't be so bad if he was a side character, but as the protagonist, we're forced to observe this world through his eyes, and his paralyzed inaction makes for some really uncompelling scenes. You get frustrated with him really really quickly. \
BUT! After all that negativity I'm still giving this a positive review. Mostly because I just really really love this genre and I'm a sucker. Good characters, cool universe, buttloads of potential... lots of problems though...\

    Mirai Nikki has a great survival game premise.  The main characters try to kill the other players or avoid being killed by using their diaries to see into the future.  Fortunately this idea never strays off course and we are left with a fun beginning to end watch.  As the game nears the end, we bite into a few treats that were only hinted at before.  The bloody road along with the sometimes irritating romance, concluded with a most satisfactory ending that made the journey all worth it.  From my understanding, the anime followed the manga pretty well, but in\
          \
        the end, they left out a few pages that would of been nice to see.  Maybe these few pages would of been confusing but once read, they really make the ending that much sweeter.\
Great animation.  The characters and everything in the Nikki world were detailed and brought to life.  The fights were slick and easy to follow.  Nothing looked half-assed.  The fights were bloody and boy was there blood.  The one thing that bothered me about the fights though was when someone got seriously injured and blood was pouring out of the wound, the wound itself was censored.  So, in some cases during this R rated anime, censorship was used.  In reality, I can certainly see why censorship was used, being a shounen and all, but it's one of those points I have to include.  With all the blood and killing shown, censoring something like a knife in the gut seems preposterous.  It was not always, just a few times throughout.\
I'll let the opening and endings alone.  They fit the bill but not everyone liked the heaviness of them.  As for the music in between, not much can be said other than it also fit the moments.  When love was in the air, you better believe love music was in the air.  A serious fight brought on serious fighting music.  In no way was the music lacking.\
Ah yes, the characters.  Much can be said about the characters.  I'll start by saying Yukki made the beginning of the anime hell.  The angst was almost unbearable.  For like 17 episodes, he refused to grow a pair. Yuno on the other hand, made the beginning worthwhile with her obsessive psychotic love for Yuki.  Nothing can stop her from protecting Yukki.  All the while nothing can stop Yukki from crying as Yuno fights for him.  Alas, don't be put off, the ending is well worth it.  Watching Yukki develop may be a hair pulling experience, but he matures into the guy we wished for in episode one.  Being a survival game, we not only have our main guys, but the anime takes a step back sometimes to explore the other players realities.  This step is a breathe of fresh air from the angst and love that dwells in each episode. \
Overall I can't stress enough that this anime should be given a chance. At least till like episode 17.  Even before that though it's a great watch.  The premise alone makes the wait for developments interesting.  The fighting and epic background music both succeed in setting the right mood and right pace.  The gore adds to that but usually when there's gore, there's Yukki crying somewhere; where there's Yukki, there's Yuno.  Like I said, persevere, it's character development.  The other players are all pretty great characters and though Yukki and Yuno can be hard to watch sometimes, when the plots a movin', everything becomes exciting.  So give it a chance, maybe you'll see that it was actually a pretty great anime.\

    First review ^^\
The premise is brilliant, but fails to live up to expectations. The writing is terrible, most characters fail to leave any impression as they do not feature for long enough. Even if they seem interesting at first, they're probably gone before you have to chance to really understand them at all.\
Which characters were decent? Well, the 9th and Akira. Unfortunately Akira does not get the screen time that I would have hoped for, as his character was very interesting and fit this genre of survival game perfectly.\
Yuno is a love/hate character. I was, at first, captivated by the insanity of what was going\
          \
        on. A young, sweet girl who captures boy's hearts, yet is a deranged psychopath. Every time she said \"Yukki\" I didn't know whether to laugh or cry, because it was so ridiculously annoying. No, sorry, it was TROLL.\
Yukitero... well, he's a massive wimp. It's understandable, so I can't criticise him for that, but his opinions and moods change practically every episode. It's far too inconsistent and really makes it hard to follow him as the protagonist. \
The whole story, especially the ending, leaves countless questions. This is highly frustrating, I almost feel worse off having watched Mirai Nikki at all.\
I try to be fair with rating, but for such a highly rated anime, this really, really disappoints.\

Initially, I thought it was really interesting, but then it just kept getting stranger and stranger to the point where I completely lost the point of the story. Also, I realized after finishing it that I didn't really like any of the characters. Maybe three, tops. None of them are the two main characters.\
I don't know; there was point where everything changed and the main character started acting insane (and not in a fun way), and it just threw me off. I couldn't figure out when he decided to completely change who he was.\
And the ending\
          \
        was so confusing? I mean, I understood it, but I didn't understand why it happened. Also, the fact that this was a love story was a little disturbing given Yuno's personality.\
I don't wanna make it sound like this anime is all bad, though. The art was beautiful. A lot of the other diary holders were very interesting, especially numbers six and nine. I just didn't like how convoluted it all was. I think if it were polished, it could be a masterpiece. \

    The review becomes short if i don't mention the spoilers. But i must say that this is the worst anime i have ever watched. I saw the name of this anime in most popular list but well looks like I confused the meaning of popularity. Popularity doesn't mean it is good. Just like those few people who are evil & bad but are popular, same goes with Mirai Nikki. When i completed this anime i got so depressed that i had to watch other anime's to feel better. This anime has probably the worst ending ever.\
\
Oh & not only the ending is messed up but\
          \
        i say the whole story line. Some people say it has good romantic scenes. I say that nothing is romantic but only rape/nudity/kissing is shown. Yuno & Yuki relationship was one sided only, even half of the episodes passed Yuki called Yuno as \"stalker\" but what Yuno does? Always kiss Yuki in the middle of the danger/fight and Yuki shows no resistance. I mean what the hell is going on? Yuno drugs him, Yuno was getting exposed day by day but Yuki in the end still managed to shows love and what happens in the end? It looks like Yuki had to go to asylum. This shows the character & story is poorly developed. \
It has worst romance, it has worst ending & worst character. To cover this mess up they released an OVA after probably almost an year. To somehow make those people happy who were complaining but sorry it looks like the author was just writing the story without even thinking of the ending. \

    First off I found this anime great. gave it a 10/10 but i think i am biased, so meh..\
people rate things according to their own bias anyway, so i done nothing wrong.\
To explain my \"bias decision\" I'm going to explain my journey to finding/watching this anime.\
(Its short dw, was going to go into my viewpoint of love ect, but i cba).\
For all intentsive purposes i would class myself yandere. Still not sure but, idc.\
With that in mind, after i watched Overlord and seeing a main character who is also essentially a yandere type of personality, i asked a few friends and saw a few tips\
          \
        and found this anime.\
Wow.\
From the outset pink hair/eyes for me is not top but its nice, but thats another thing.\
As what one of the persons who recommended to me this anime, because of its yandere. They said:\
\"your abit slow to watch this.\" I disagreed and said \"best for last\", i was right.\
!MIGHT GO INTO \"SPOILERISH\" TERRATORY NOW.\
! but its more of a point of view apposed to actual leeked story/ plot.!\
\
What really got me was through the anime a certain... feel,string,motive,agenda or even the plot itself gets Orchestrated into motion.\
And you as the viewer are trying to decide or figure out and take a side.\
I think is brilliant, because of that everyone should watch this anime.\
But i'm obsessively biased toward the animes theme. So what do i know.",

    I hate this show. It is without a doubt, one of the worst anime I have ever seen and I have no clue why people like it. Calling this show a travesty, a complete mess or an abomination would be too kind. BTW this review is going to be filled with spoilers from the show. Not that I'd ever encourage anyone to watch this...thing.\
But hey, I'll be fair. Let me start with the \
THINGS I LIKE:-\
(+)um...............it has a nice premise. Yeah, it's a battle royale with the players having the ability to read their future. Too bad the potential was squandered by the terrible writing\
          \
        but yeah, the premise is good.\
(+).......................................................oh yeah, in one of the episodes there is this white-haired gay dude who creates a strategy to defeat an opponent and this strategy makes sense. Too bad it's the only thing that makes sense in this entire \"series\" and the rules this strategy took into account for only mattered in that one episode, but yeah, that was there\
(+)and um...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................nope, that's it.\
So, thanks for reading my review, fans of Mirai Nikki, and please leave your wonderful, smart, positive, constructive criticism which........oh, to hell with it, I'm going to be killed anyways.\
THINGS I DON'T LIKE:-\
Everything else. I'll just get the animation and sound out of the way. They were the only decent things in this entire show. I did not find the animation to be anything great and I don't remember any of the songs apart from the first opening. I won't say I hated but I definitely did not like them. There was CGI in the show, and it looked terrible. Some of the animation was rather clunky. Some scenes with a lot of blood and gore had a very light colour palette which felt off. Character designs were alright except for a muffin lady who probably had it's origins on toilet paper. As for the sound, I've forgotten about it. Nothing else to say here.\
So apart from that, what is it that this show does so wrong?\
(-)The Premise\
So the start of the show is that there is this Shinji Ikari clone(albeit without the depth and struggles) who always writes has daily events on his cellphone like a diary and has an imaginary friend and one day he finds out that this imaginary friend of his is actually The God Of Time And Space and he has chosen twelve or thirteen or some number of people (including him) to fight a battle royale to the death where each of the participants' phones have the ability to show them text messages about what is going to happen to them in the future. So does that mean that every single one of them had to imagine Deus ex Machina(I'm not joking, that's the god's name....probably a symbolic representation for what the entire show is about) the exact same way? Seems kinda weird some of them would even have imaginary friends considering that even the police captain and the mayor of the city are involved. How are these guys selected? Are they chosen at random or does the god choose them? The reason I bring this up is because...\
(-)The Participants\
Some of the participants include\
-an antisocial boy\
-a chick who should be in an asylum\
-that muffin lady who would normally never hurt anyone\
-a cult leader who never leaves a room because she has bad eyesight(instead of wearing spectacles) and has been molested by cult members as a child\
-a five year old (not a typo....for real)\
-an atheist (whose first act as god is to kill anyone who believes in god)\
But hey, he's a god, he knows everything. He also knows that setting a death tournament to decide the next God will result in the winner being of sound mind and body with positive ideals and good thoughts and values.\
The only thing the writers had to do in order to make it a little more sensible would be to make the god a god of death. Thus, it makes more sense for the participants to kill each other. I mean, the god of time and space doesn't do much  to influence either of these things in the whole show.\
The thing that makes this whole thing worse is how retarded the characters behave. Firstly, every one of them goes against our protagonists instead of ever fighting each other. There is also a rule that says that if one breaks the phone of a participant, that participant dies. Which is something our characters will do only when the plot calls for it and it will always be in favour of the protagonists. There were so many instances where the characters could easily get rid of their opponents but unfortunately there is something else going on inside their heads. Things got to a point where one of the villains (i.e. everyone besides the protagonist, because everyone ends up betraying the protagonist) is actually able to get the protagonist's phone, but instead of destroying it, he waits until the protagonist arrives at the scene and then gives the phone to the protagonist's father, and asks him to break the phone! Thirdly, everyone has a Future Diary (that cellphone) but they will only read it when the plot calls for it. If any of you do a dare where you have a glass of beer every time an incident could have been avoided if the characters had just looked at their f*king diaries, you would probably be dead within five episodes. Unfortunately, there are more pressing matters for the characters to undertake such as going to school right after you've had a near death experience. Furthermore, no one has any proof that killing these people and becoming a God will allow them to do whatever they want to do which is, I don't know! What would five year old's want to do after becoming god? \
And no, the nonsense doesn't end there\
-the chick, named Yuno- a name you may never have heard of- regularly murders people, and she has murdered a LOT of people including SWAT members who were told that this girl is a psychopath. In one of the episodes, she was taken into custody, and guess what, they just let her go. Genius!\
-Yuno's parents used to mistreat Yuno because, and I quote from this anime's wiki, \"Yuno's mother was ill and believed she was a terrible wife and mother, and believed punishing Yuno was her only way to earn happiness.. While Yuno's father was objective to his wife's severe treatment of Yuno, he did little to nothing to stop her.\" Amazing!\
-The five year old was chosen because he is the smartest five year old child in the world. I don't know how smart that is but it appears to be smart enough that the child can order poisons and gas masks the size of five year olds. Genius!\
-We need to find out the identity of a particular diary user. What should we do? Oh, I know! Lets look at stocks! \
-The mayor of the city converts an entire city's phones into future diaries. Oh my god! So evil! Our protagoninsts have to rush there to stop him now. Yuno what that means? Genocide of innocent civilians by our protagonists! \
-Oh no! All phones in the city have been converted into future diaries! What is the reaction of the general population to such a huge event?.......................<no reaction>...........<citizens don't give a damn>\
-Oh no! An apocalypse which is destroying the world has started! And guess what? The apocalypse is only around the ten people we know! I am not joking! There is not a single soul in the entire world aside from these people!\
-And you know what? The master planner of everything was not Deus ex Machina but his chibi assistant who had planned everything, including the love between Yuki and Yuno, the gay detective guy, the mayor and more! And guess why she does it? Because she's having fun!\
And guess what! This is just some of the nonsense that happens in this series. And what I've written down here is merely a little glimpse into it. \
(-)Romance\
Lets play a game here, shall we? At the end of the series, Yuki(the protagonist) and Yuno finally get together. Tell me, what do you think, I thought when I saw that scene:\
a)<Yaaay>\
b)<eh, whatever>\
c)<groan>\
If you thought b or c, then I am sorry, I did not enjoy this show as much as you think I did. \
This scene I talked about took place in an OVA that was released after the series. And it was something I did not watch as my soul was a bit too drained at that point. And that's because the romance in this show sucked! It was a one sided relationship for 95% of the series and it was based upon the fact that Yuno had an infatuation for Yuki which he doesn't share. And then a part comes where Yuki finally starts to like Yuno. And guess what Yuno does in return? She drugs Yuki, locks him up in a house and force-feeds him inedible food until that perfect day comes, as written in my future diary, where me and Yuki will finally 'become one'! Aw. \
And if you thought that Yuki(after being saved) now hates Yuno, you are clearly living in the real world which is not something Mirai Nikki wants. No here, after just one episode, Yuki forgives Yuno and things go back to square one. Oh and their next villains are beaten by them because 'their love is stronger' than this established couple's who have good reason to love each other! Amazing, right?\
And later that fateful day comes where Yuki and Yuno 'become one' and they do! Aw. I wonder what the next logical step will be. Oh, I know! How about Yuno takes out an axe out of her ass and tries to kill Yuki! And the Oscar for best screenplay goes to Mirai Nikki!\
Yuno has no good reason to like Yuki the way she does. But she virtually becomes a slave for Yuki and is completely loyal and faithful to him! She is willing to die for Yuki because she is infatuated to him. She is willing to keep him for days in a stinking room, drugging him and force-feeding him crap just so she may one day 'become one' with Yuki. And Yuki, for the most part, sees her as an annoyance and only uses her to get him out of trouble and to kill his enemies and he knows that Yuno is a psychopath who keeps dead bodies inside her house. They're romance is unrealistic and Yuno needs to be sent to an asylum.\
\
So there, I hate this show and I would encourage everyone to stay away from it. Unless, I guess, if you enjoy watching terrible shows because you find them funny because of how bad they are. So yeah, I know that my inbox is probably going to be filled with comments telling me to kill myself, but whatever, I don't care. I hate this show and I give it a biased score of 3/10.  \

    This was a such a great anime! I loved the twists and turns. \
I watched this in about 4 days so I really experienced it real time. \
I loved the supernatural and psychological elements to this anime. I also enjoyed all of the different sets of characters of the phone holders.\
Because of the length of this anime, it allowed it to really have a meaty story and allow for great character development. I had some characters that I really liked that I hated in the beginning. \
After I saw this anime, I was really exhausted in a good way. I couldn't believe the places that\
          \
        this series went. Bravo!\
I thought the OVA was very worthy and the ending was super satisfying. \

    I could really summarize this review into one line.\
Reason to watch? Yuno.\
Story: 7\
I mean it's not great, but the concept of seeing the future isn't that new. While a future diary is different, there is some plot holes. And a lot of things that didn't make sense. But it was okay, because Yuno was there, so it was all good.\
Art: 8\
Yuno was drawn, so, pretty good art.\
Sound: 8\
Personally I liked the sound. And also Yuno was in the op. Both openings, actually.\
Character: 10\
Not characters, but character. The characters, emphasis on plural, were generic and shit. But Yuno, Yuno was the only reason I watched this\
          \
        show and the only reason you need to watch it as well. \
Enjoyment: 9\
Pretty fun to watch, although that 9 isn't including episodes 16-21, or something like that, where the story got really boring, and just stupid.\
Overall: 8\
There's not much to say. Just Yuno. Just watch because of Yuno. Yuno is love. Yuno is life. Yuno.\

    So, if you can suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the show, its actually a very rewarding experience. The first episode or so, I damn near dropped it, thinking it was going to be the typical fighting anime. \
Instead, it really fleshed out into one of the most addicting and \"page turning\" anime I've seen since Parasyte or Death Note. \
To preface this, my favorite anime are usually of the more serious/psychological type, ie, Psycho Pass, Ajin, Death Note, Parasyte, GiTS, Akira, Tokyo Ghoul, Broken Blade, Berserk, ect. ect. \
Once you get passed the first episode or so, the show starts to become a lot\
          \
        more like death note, were there are twists and turns. The best part, really, is the heroine, who is an anti-hero in the weirdest way possible.\
You can't help but root for her half the time, while the other half of you almost wants to kill her yourself. In that respect, the writing can be quite good, especially when they go into the backstories of each character (which they do, sometimes in detail.)\
Once the story gets going, there is practically no filler. The problem that most people have is that sometimes (alot) they stretch the foundations of time and space/ alternate reality/ the cell phones overarching technology. \
However, if you can overlook some of the more confused intricate details, this is a great show that will keep you watching episode after episode. \
The ending is pretty worth it, too. They definitely had enough of a story to fill all 26 odd episodes, so unlike alot of anime they didn't have to make false endings and patch the rest of the season together like, say, Sword Art. \
Its a fun, psychotic girlfriend, paranoia filled adventure of anti-heroes and heroines that is nothing if not original in its execution. \
Think Death Note if it took itself WAY less seriously, mixed with Battle Royale.\

 As the world keeps changing, new things come into our lives, though some virtues never change. Looking back at the history of mankind, all I see is greed, pain, misery and terror. Just waiting to take you down, stick a knife in your back and enjoy the light and warmth of the sun on the mountain of corpse. But there is also love, compassion, trust, hope; and just as yin yang, this world is also an indivisible piece of light and darkness, good and evil, Mirai Nikki lovers and Mirai Nikki haters. \
 There is one good thing about being a pawn – while you’re small, you can witness the greatness of those giants that tower over the chessboard, their magnitude, silent wisdom and cold beauty. “What of them is Mirai Nikki”, –  you ask?\
 - EVERYTHING!!!\
 It’s a knight, who overcomes his enemies with valor and steel will; a rook whose brute force makes everyone retreat; a bishop with his dark plans and traitorous moves; queen that charms everyone around and commands them from shade; a king, who stands with high raised head above all and doesn’t bend until the very end. Future Diary is a chessboard itself, black and white it reflects the true essence of life,.. and humans, as pieces on it. \
 Flawlessly flawless characters, gorgeously gorgeous plot, impeccably impeccable music, like a waltz of death dictated by a violin – this is the masterpiece that struck me and forever burned a marking on my soul. Like a puzzle, each piece of which ideally catches up with another, building greater larger view, picture of unseen beauty that makes you cry by just witnessing its genius work, impressing every moment into your memory with the strength of gravity of hundreds of suns!\
 As the world keeps changing, new things come into our lives, though some virtues always stay the same. \
 Mirai Nikki is the true image of human nature, true encyclopedia of human relations, tricks and lies, TRUE VERITY OF LIFE.\
 Mirai Nikki is Veni, Vidi, Vici.\
 Mirai Nikki is Checkmate. \
 Mirai Nikki is AMEN!\

    Yanderes... what is about them makes us love them, there insane, immoral, and downright creepy, and yet we still love them. Mirrai Nikki probably has the one yandere who is called the Queen of Yanderes, does she deserve this title and does this anime deserve the praise or hate it gets?\
Story 5/10: What started as a game set up by a dying god (how can a god die naturally), to choose his successor from a pool of 12 people, armed with cellphones that can see the future, turned into a plot so filled with holes it's like Swiss cheese. Originally what seems to be just\
          \
        about your average boring MC caught up in a thriller survival game, turns into this, 'what the hell', mess of time travel and dimension hopping. Honestly what seemed like a fairly straight forward plot turns into such a mess that it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth and your brain confused.\
Art 7/10: It's decent enough art, nothing to write home about but it certainty gets the job done. All the characters look good (well the females at least :P). The backgrounds and sets are all well animated and the effects are pretty good.\
Sound 9/10: That first opening theme... need I say more! It's probably my favorite anime opening and it just really sets the stage for epicness. The second opening theme, not the same just not the same, really disappointing. Still that first theme, utterly epic!\
Character 6/10: We have great characters, we have 'meh, characters, and then we 'ugh why' characters! Let's look at our mains, first we have Yuki, boring loner with no friends. Yeah because that's just what we want in an MC! He does become more of a badass towards the end, but it just feels really forced and I don't know it doesn't feel right. Now let's look at the real star of the show, Yuno. She is the embodiment of the Yandere! Crazy, in love, and no qualms about killing. Yuno is a great character, she has a tragic past, she's entertaining, and unless you hate Yanderes, you can't help but emphasize with her a little. Well the rest of the cast is varied, one diary user, 9th, Miene, is intersting. I love badass females but then they went and ruined her by turning her into a Tsundere. Other then that the other characters are either vary between okay and ugh. Akise, Hinata, and Mao are 3 characters that become Yuki's friends, really wish they had been developed more.\
Enjoyment 8/10: I feel like people often forget why we watch anime, not for a deep story, or nice art, or even great characters. We watch anime to be entertained! Despite all its flaws, Mirrai Nikki will have you entertained, it keeps you guessing on what's going to happen and wants you keep wanting more. It's fun to watch, just don't think to much on its many problems and you'll have fun.\
Overall 7/10: So does Mirrai Nikki deserve it's praise or it's hate? Well perhaps it's no masterpiece buts it's not garbage. All I can say it's fun, it has it flaws most certainly but it's fun and I feel like that's what matters. \

    Despite my rating, The Future Diary is not without its flaws.  There's definitely some weird occurrences and outcomes of events.  I just personally find them plausible since it is a battle royale (survival) style anime and when something is a survival game, you tend to expect weird inexplicable things to happen.\
I was hooked from the first episode and for me, the show stayed very entertaining throughout the series.  It doesn't really become some deep adult story, but it also doesn't try to be deep when it's really not; I see it this way anyway.  I personally enjoyed all the additions to\
          \
        the plot in second half.\
To me, the characters were also really fitting for the show.  Ina survival game, you need a bunch of psychopaths to keep things interesting.  If everyone besides Yukiteru was also pretty normal, it wouldn't be as much fun to watch.  For how screwed up and over the top Yuno is, she is a perfect fit for this of story.  The rest of the cast were prettying interesting to when they had their screen time or at least they added interesting plot.  \
The music was really good too.  The opening theme for the first half instantly became one of my favorites and I don't think I ever skipped the first ending theme besides in the first 4 episodes that I saw at an anime club meeting.  The opening and ending themes for the second half are good too and also some of my favorites.  \
Overall, I feel very satisfied; I know many others are not satisfied with this, but I don't need to share their feelings.  I'm glad I suggested this when my anime club was voting on a thriller anime.  It was great watch and since I put it up without seeing it previously, it made for an even better experience.   \

    This is the first review I have given to an anime show. I have seen a reasonable amount (not by MAL's standards), and is \"one of many\" types of media I watch. (MILD SPOILERS AHEAD - Mainly at the end to due with characters)\
It's one of the pieces of fiction that, in my opinion, best dealt with the whole concept of alternate realities, time travel, and past/present/future relationship and clairvoyance. It managed to create a \"complicated\" and interesting world/concept, without it being impossible to understand/filled with holes. This is what Mirai Nikki does best, and in my opinion excels at. I really liked it, and\
          \
        it unravelled beautifully.\
The sound (I watched the subtitled version) was frankly very good. Every time the static appeared by whole mind jumped even if physically only my pupils dilated, so quiet was I from not wanting to miss a thing. Explosions, cuts, they surround us, and I bet if I had watched it with a good surround sound system I would have been even more pulled in.\
The story also unravelled in a beautiful way, if you look at it from a macro perspective. It is mostly good, but what might have been a 8 is brought up to a 10 because of what I mentioned before (concept/macro view of the story). The twists and turns work well, and while it does fail when we micro analyse it, in my opinion that starts being due to the characters and not what here counts as \"story\".\
This is where I have my only qualm, and it is to do with character arcs. (SPOILERS) \
Minene, for example. While it is not completely unrealistic (and in my opinion it's actually justified, contrary to many other reviews here), it's just far too much all the changes she goes through. Starts off as deranged terrorist, then bamf fighter, then good terrorist... they could have shown better that she was all of that all the time (which I'm guessing was the creators intention), and that du...tri...multifaceted nature wasn't conveyed to the viewer well enough. She was not a \"tsundere\" - her \"warm side\" was shown almost right from the beginning, but it was all clouded with, well, her being an international terrorist. \"Yukki\" also suffers from this lack of \"explanation/clarification\" - many characters have reactions that seem out of place at best. We do have to wonder if they were chosen exactly because of this.\
Another thing, half character half story, Mur Mur's bits at the end either work perfectly to brighten up the mood between episodes, or completely ruin it. I knew she was up to something from one of her first comments, and believe that those Mur Mur bits at the end were there to deceive the viewer into dismissing Mur Mur as nothing but a gimmick (which many people that I've talken to and watched the show \"fell for\".\

    Mirai Nikki, in English \"The Future Diary\", it's a survival games-like anime, where 12 diary owners fight each other to become the God of Time and Space. The story is narrated by Amano Yukiteru, the main character and the frist diary owner, known as First. I might say that Mirai Nikki is my favourite anime, but I'm very critical.\
Story: 8/10\
The story is very interesting. Having a device that let you know what will happen in a future of 90 days and change it in consequence it's a great thing to make the spectator want to know what will happen in the story, but it have\

The characters in Mirai Nikki are amazing, eveyone have a backstory and all of the backstory are shocking. Fell in love with the character of Uryuu Minene. \
Enjoyment: 9/10\
I really enjoyed Mirai Nikki because it was very cool the way the story was developed and all the consequences of the actions of Amano Yukiteru.",

    I never wrote a review for any Anime before but this is definitely worth it! \
This is probably one of the best Animes i've ever watched. \
If there's one thing I like in both Anime and movies it's plot twists.\
At first I thought this Anime was just a plain boring one like any other but the further you get into the Anime the more plot twists happen.\
And I've gotta admit some just left me speachless! I cried and laughed so many times, it's simultaneously a sad and beautiful Anime.\
If I have anything to say; if you're going to watch this Anime (which you definitely should)\
          \
        watch it till the very end! And after you watched the last episode watch the Redial OVA.\
You'll have a big hole in your heart after watching the ending, but the Redial OVA just fills it up again.\
10/10 love this Anime ♥\

    First of all, I finished this anime long time back.....and the reason I'm writing this review now is well....I occasionally think to myself how awesome of an anime \"mirai nikki\" was. All the way from the plotline to the various character backstory's.\
The anime starts off with a \"Bang\" effect as it explains the confusing yet interesting plot of the anime.\
The character's of this story are what makes this anime one of the best there is.....and as everyone says the credit should go to the yandere/protagonist/antagonist Gasai yuno. Her character is what everyone watching this anime is interested in along with it's other mysteries.\
The story explains\
          \
        it's plot little by little.....while some may get it, some won't. But i the end you just have to think to yourself about what happened and you could even guess what happens in the next episode. And don't worry if you still don't get it...it will all start to make sense after you finish it.\
Well my final words are; those of you who love a good mystery/psychological/thriller anime....this is the one.\
And for those of you who'd love a great story and awesome characters...this is still the one....who knows it may even make you love psychological/thriller/mystery anime.\

    Mirai Nikki is a chilling masterpiece that integrates the themes of death, violence and power into its story amazingly, MN specialises in its ability to play with the idea of how people can do horrible things when faces with the reward of power, it delves into the human psyche better than any other anime could, The animation is outstanding and blew me away from start to finish, the characters are all unique in their own way and written masterfully, the show had me engaged and on the edge of my seat through the whole running time, i highly recommend this masterpiece for anyone looking for\

    Mirai Nikki has become one of an all time favorite. This desensitizing anime will have you going crazy and itching for more!\
Stroy:\
A death game between 12 beholders of Diaries that aid in a killing spree to become a God. The main drive is to be the last one standing, even if meaning you had to do some sickening and twisted actions. This survival game is centered around Amano and Yuno, two lovers, who stick together through life and death situations. Not only is Amano the favored to win, he becomes the main target in this sadistic entertainment.\
Art:\
The art in this anime is quite gruesome. I\
          \
        would have loved to have seen clearer graphics when dealing with most battle scenes, but I'm not too picky about it. The art did not take away from the intensity, but it did not enhance it either. \
Sound:\
The sound is pretty clear, but the music that the anime produces is what carries the emotion through the series.\
Overall:\
My overall opinion of of Mirai Nikki is that it is a must see. The characters caught my heart when facing their tragedy of their world. A top favorite.\

    I got to be honest. I thought I could like this anime just a little more. But, it's just.... the hell? What's a going on a here? Am I on drugs? Am I hallucinating? What the fuck are these people doing... do they have inhuman abilities or some shit like that? Whatever...\
Story: 7/10\
Story is like, uh... It's okay, I guess. The god of time and space, Deus Ex Machina is dying and sets up a game for 12 people to compete against each other with diaries that tell the future and shit like that, so he can get one of them to become his successor,\
          \
        a.k.a the new god of time and space. At first, the main protagonist, and a major fucking loner, Amano Yukiteru, thought of Deus Ex Machina as his imaginary friend, oh... sorry I didn't tell you but...yeah. I'm the god of time and fucking space. Here are all the diary owners for ya!\
A loner, a stalker, a teacher, an officer, a five-year old kid, a cult leader, a couple, some big-headed person, a terrorist (my favorite), a dog-lover, the mayor, blind guy that likes justice.\
Art: 8/10\
Eh, I didn't know what to rate this, because it was kind of shitty but it was okay, so I just gave it an 8. The character designs are pretty legitimate or are they fake?? Nah, they're pretty legit. I don't like how creepy the characters can look at times, but... that's good, I guess? I don't really know. I'm not very good with this particular anime art. I don't really like how things are drawn, but couldn't decide whether it's good or not, so entered \"fuck this shit\" mode and gave it an 18... I mean 8.\
Sound: 8/10\
I think I like the soundtrack better than the actual thing. I mean, the soundtrack makes the deaths or whatever, makes me feel sympathy or some shit like that. Actually the only character deaths I felt sympathy in *insert spoiler here*. Yes. Insert that spoiler. But none of you should know, because I'm my own person. You are not me.\
Character: 5/10\
Utter shit. I'm saying this, but I've given it a 5. I'm giving generosity, you see. All the characters in this show are pretty goddamn shit. Except Uryuu Minene... and Keigo Kurusu, maybe? Anyway, I cannot feel anything for all the character deaths, except maybe one or two, but other than that, it's like, yeah, whatever... die already. Yuno is just a psychopathic insane bitch who would kill anyone who tries to befriend Yukiteru, or kiss him or whatever. Talking about Yukiteru, he turned into an absolute fuckhead  at the end of the anime. I mean, I should probably make a thread about this and complain why Yukiteru is such an idiot, don't know why he loves Yuno, but again, I'll make a thread about that. So goddamn dumb. D... dumb! Dumb! Dumb! Best characters in this show; Hinata Hino, Nonosaka Mao, Kosaka Ouji, Akise Aru, Uryuu Minene and Misama Nishijima. All the others are shit. I used to like Yukiteru, but no... he just decides he is... just retarded. You should know what I mean.\
Overall: 6/10\
6. Generous? Fuck if I know, you decide. I don't like what this anime focuses on. It's supposed to be a survival game, where all the mother-fuckers die and then one becomes god, but... it kind of focuses on Yuno trying to get Yukiteru to love her. But, why? She's crazy, insane... yeah... what's not to love, right? Oh, even more... she will try to tie you up until July 28th! Isn't that great?! Not to forget that she can MAGICALLY hit knives out of the way. The cursing isn't really all that necessary... actually it is. I thought this anime would be better... but I do admit it has a bit of moments... uh, I think. I may have wasted time by waiting purposely to finish this anime. I shoulda just got it over and done with.\

Even if the art and characters could have been better, it was forgivable due to the story's premise, plot, and twists. I highly recommend this for thriller nuts and sci-fi lovers out there. I you are not used to gore and blood, you may back out on this one.\
STORY AND PLOT 10/10\
The story is mind boggling. Twist of events will blow you away. The premise was clear and intriguing, and world laws and settings were presented just right.\
ART 7/10\
The art was good, but not that outstanding.\
CHARACTER 6/10\
Some characters turned out to be likable. However, in the anime, most characters were not round\
          \
        characters. They did not develop into better characters every episode, instead an abrupt change were imposed in the last episodes of the series. Characters were not presented in more depth, and I could have wished for a clearer presentation of motives, background, and psychology of the characters. Side characters seemed to me as wallflowers.\
ENJOYMENT 10/10\
If you like thrillers, Mirai Nikki has it all.\

    This is my first review so I'm sorry if I get this wrong xD\
Mirai Nikki, or, Future diary (however you prefer) Is straight up amazing, I absolutely loved it! It is one of those Unique anime's that you will rarely find, but when you do, you'll have so many urge's to watch it forever!\
Story: The story for Mirai Nikki is amazing, For a survival genre of anime, I'm really impressed with the originality that has been set, It has so many twists and turns that will leave you clueless, bombshells that will make your jaw drop & Literally the most unique ending I have EVER\
          \
        seen! It will have you in tears, begging for more!\
Overall I rate the story a 10/10 Easily, It is so amazing so It deserves nothing less!\
Art: The art for Mirai Nikki was very well done, you get the nice motion, modern day feel with the new anime's while watching this, the Scenery is amazing as well, especially how well the atmospheric changes occur at the right moment, for instance, an emotional scene would have rain or snow.\
There might be a few scene's that leave you a question or two, but it's really hard to notice and is usually just a distant face or an odd angle, Overall, I rate it an 8/10 :)\
Sound: The soundtrack for Mirai Nikki is Outstanding, it encourages the experience of feeling like you're actually there! the combat music is one of a kind, it couldn't be better, however, it was the emotional soundtracks that really got me, the are honestly to good to explain, you'll have to watch it and see what I mean :P\
Overall, I rate the sound a 9/10 (p.s there may be a few overused sound effects that you will hear in blogs & skits, but it really doesn't affect the experience)\
Character: The character build in this anime is Flawless, they'll feel so real you'll start to believe they are! It astonishes me how well they developed each character, good or bad, giving them their own unique features that makes them grow into someone you'll be fascinated in! The dark past's and bright future's of everyone make the characters more likeable as well!\
Overall, I rate the character's a 10/10 they couldn't have made it better\
Enjoyment: I have said it before and I will say it again, I LOVED Mirai Nikki, with each episode bringing a new  adventure to the table you'll never be sitting there in boredom! every episode will leave you begging for more because it is so addictive, Overall, I rate the Enjoyment a 9/10 (The only reason why it isn't a 10 is because there is such an emotional part that will make you break down and cry like a baby)\
My final rating is a 9/10! It is absolutely outstanding and is definitely a must watch! I tried to make sure I didn't reveal any spoilers whilst also trying to make it sound approachable, so sorry if this wasn't to helpful :P\
Once again this is my first review, so don't be to harsh! XD\

    [NOTE: There are minor spoilers in this review]\
What happens when you take \"The Hunger Games\" and include iPhones?\
You get Mirai Nikki.\
Mirai Nikki was one of those anime that really had uniqueness. Each character..ehm, I mean diary, was each different and each had a specific trait that matched what each of the diary owners characteristic were. Anyways, Mirai Nikki had so much twists and shock to the point where I was speechless(especially in Episode 23...that shocked me the most.)\
Mirai Nikki was a really entertaining anime because it felt like I watched \"The Hunger Games\" in Anime version or in Japanese for instance. The concept was interesting\
          \
        and the characters actually had good character development with the main protagonists.\
Story: The basic concept was basically a survival game to see who would be the next God of Time and Space, set up by the current God of the world. The God chose 12? (hopefully i'm accurate -_-) people to battle it out with their phon...I mean...diaries so they can plan out how to eliminate them. I liked the concept because it would create a lot of twists and suspencefullness, this felt like one of those anime which will hold you on the back of your seats! (9/10)\
Art: The artwork was pretty good and solid, I really like the gore they added though because it made it look a little realistic. The animation is a little bit funky looking, but I didn't change my mind that it was still enjoyable. (8.5/10)\
Sound: The sound...it was alright at first, but then it started getting a little down and down, but the sound-track was amazing! I couldn't stop listening to the 2nd Arc Ending! Anyways, the sound was pretty good, could've improved a little more though.\
Character: Each character had uniqueness...that's it. But overall, the protagonists and antagonists were each fun and clever. Each of the antagonists had interesting plans to kill each other with their diaries and they all have intelligent in them, that's what I like. From the protagonists however, Yuki was a little lob-sided, but still was a fun character to watch. Yuno however, was just the example of a perfect Yandere! She blew my mind from being a nice, gentle girl to this...idk what to call her...DEVIL! She became a deviled demon...and she was just badass in my opinion. They could've improved the character tbh, but still overall good. (7.5/10)\
Enjoyment: I ENJOYED THIS SERIES SO MUCH! I loved this battle that they had! Made me feel like \"what's gonna happen next?\" \"who's gonna die?\" \"what will happen?\" it made me ask these questions that later on would give me a lot of interesting answers. Just an enjoyable anime overall and you would love it too! (9.5/10)\
Should you watch this anime: Yes, definite watch, especially if you love Horror, Drama, and Suspence. This is a perfect watch for people because Mirai Nikki was a pretty good series overall and you might enjoy it also!\
Similar Anime: Higurashi, Death Note, Sword Art Online(in the aspect of \"surviving\")\
Final Comments: The anime really hit me, and I was glad that my friends told me to watch it because it was just amazing and I look forward to reading the manga in the future!\
Rating: 8.5/10\
(Thank you guys for reading my first ever review...i'm not really good at writing reviews, but I gave it a try! Let me know what you think in my profile and I hope you enjoyed this review and you hope for me to post the next one!)\

    This is my first review so no hating, ok? :3 Well a little criticism is fine, but make it constructive.\
I've watched many anime, but of all, I found Mirai Nikki the most thrilling. The plot is similar to the Hunger Games, but instead its set in a different time period and darker. The main character here is Amano Yukiteru, a plain student who doesn't like to stand out much, but ends up being caught up in the bloody game, and is one of the few diary owners who are still sane.\
Story: 9/10\
The plot, like I said, is the same as the Hunger Games, a classic\
          \
        elimination battle royale plot. The story isn't incredibly fast paced, But there is the big twist that comes along the way. Sure, it may be a game where everyone has to kill each other, but this is also where it splits from Hunger Games. Its not what you think at first. Along the anime, the more diary owners are killed, the more the plot dives deeper into the past life of Yuno, a psychotic but sweet girl who is obsessed with Yukiteru (also known as yandere). The reason why I gave the story a 9/10, though, is because this anime breaks the fourth wall a bit too much, giving some pathetic characters a giant edge over something that normally wouldn't be possible.\
Art: 10/10\
What can I say? Amazing art. It actually compliments the thrill and psychology in this anime. The art is clear and the character emotions and gestures are shown beautifully.\
Sound: 10/10\
Music is good, shows the aura of the anime and goes along with the anime. Yousei Teikoku is my favourite band since their music creates the best feel for this anime. Dead End (second opening) actually shows what happens in the anime if you look at the lyrics. Voice acting is fantastic, especially when acting out as the personality of the characters.\
Character: 10/10\
This is what got me so excited about Mirai Nikki. Yuki's personality is a wimp who before, does not want anything to do with the game, due to the horrors he had witnessed at the beginning. The fact that this anime has a pathetic and weak main character is what makes this anime better, and the fact that later in the anime he ends up putting a proud and confident act is what pushes it better. The side characters are also well developed and there are reasons concerning their actions. Yuno Gasai, the female lead character, is also the main selling point of the anime. Her back story is not as tragic as the Sixth, yet her personality was the result of what happened when she was small. Shes one of the best yanderes I've ever seen, as one moment shes cute and innocent, the next moment she does something completely unpredictable and insane.\
Enjoyment: 10/10\
I loved this anime. The thrill of it was what made me watch it without dropping it. Ever since I watched the first episode, I would wonder what happened in the next episode and would want to watch it in school secretly. Mirai Nikki is an anime that was so unexpected that sometimes I would try to predict what would happen next and then it would completely surprise me.\
Overall: 9/10\
If you liked Higurashi and Chaos;Head, then I think it would be good giving Mirai Nikki a shot. Sure, not as much horror as Higurashi, but the dark effects and psychological scenes make up for it.\

    Mirai Nikki was a very enjoyable anime, but the being said, I thought it was no where near perfect even though it was good. I only gave this one an eight because I thought that the whole time travel thing was used way too late in the anime to be used effectively also, I did not like the fact that there was no way to like Yuno Gasai as much  as I thought I could have until you find out why she is like that.  I like the comedy relief character in the anime almost as much as my first, second, and third\
          \
        favorites.  The comic relief was none other than twelfth because of the whole power rangers ripoff thing he had going on, outstanding.  In order my three favorites diary user were Yukiteru, Yuno, then both Marco and Ai (seventh) all three of these characters were amazing for their own details.  This anime was a very well written story but it of course had it's flaws that could have been prevented without the whole time travel thing. \

    Story-wise I found the anime rather intriguing as it is full of twists in the places where you least expect them. The story has a very good pace and it does not slow down at all, which is great because it keeps the audience entertained throughout the 26 episodes.\
I especially love this anime partly because I was mesmerized by how the anime is brave and straight forward with the gore without having the audience turning away from the screen. If I compare this anime with Another, I will say that this anime's gory elements is way more entertaining than the ones in Another as in\
          \
        this anime you are actually thinking along with the characters: \"Die b*tch dieee-!\" rather than \"Oh sh*t another person just die, UMMM....= =\"\
I also fell in love with the character developments in Mirai Nikki. Other than the yandere craziness, Gasai Yuno brings the audience to understand that sometimes love can become an illness, and that a person can become evil through motivations that originally evolve from a pure and innocent wish. It's her insecurity of not being able to receive love from her childhood that contributes to her insanity and her obsession with Yukiteru. Like Yagami Light in Death Notes whose arrogance and hunger for power lead him astray from his original goal of creating justice for the world, Gasai Yuno in Mirai Nikki turns her desire for love into something monstrous and uncontrollable... and I will just leave it at that since I don't want to spoil the story for anyone. And if you can follow my odd comparison of Gasai Yuno to Yagami Light still, the most impressive part about this story is that unlike Light who meets destruction in the end, Yuno is actually saved by love, hope, and forgiveness.... Okay. I will shut up now.\
So yeah, definitely watch this mind-blowing anime! I highly recommend it. & Akise Aru, dayum, gotta love that boy.\

    Found Mirai Nikki by typing \"best anime 2012\" into google and clicking the first link. One of the best decisions ever made! Mirai Nikki is a thriller in which the characters play their role until the end. 12 characters gain the power to see the future by Deus Ex (the God of Time and Space) through use of their individual diaries. Each diary has its unique advantage as well as its own disadvantage that helps the character survive (or die). The story line isn't why people should watch this Anime. Yuno - the main female plays the best Yandere I have ever seen. Obsessed with\
          \
        the main Male lead -Yuuki, Yuno protects him until the very end. Yuno is beautiful, smart, and resourceful but when watchers learn what she is really capable of its both scary and fascinating. If you read the Manga then you know that this anime also has a surprise twist at the end.\

    Mirai Nikki a spectacular anime to withhold. The anime truly is amazing because the art is really well made. The fact that the characters have so many facial expressions. The main reason is that it kept on making me thinking about what's going to happen next. Every time whatever I think it turns out to be the opposite so it really is kind of mysterious. The characters have a really dynamic personality so there always changing and the anime is usually shown through the eyes of Amano, Yukiteru(the main character). Its also a really good romance anime about how they get closer to each other\
          \
        even though the main character doesn't like Yuno. Luckily its not one of those anime's where they get together for a impractical reason. If you ever watch the anime give about the first 3 episodes a try. The first episode starts out pretty weak but the second and third just got better and better. The more they improved the more I enjoyed my self. I've had an awesome time watching the 8 episodes. The dub & original are quite good & appealing but I'd prefer you watch sub episodes because its so much better. The story starts off pretty smoothly.",

      --WARNING-- (This does contain a few spoilers, because it was hard not to put any in.)  \
I told myself I would never write a review for this anime simply because almost everything that I would type out would be negative. Now here I am.\
  I feel like I more or less should warn people who were as naive as me. I started this anime with high hopes and perhaps to see something that I had never before seen. While the concept was amazing, I don't feel they took it in the right direction.\
  I'm not going to sit here and\
          \
        give you a run down of the whole anime because you really can look anywhere to find the story. But the bottom line is it was just an utter disappointment.\
  I came upon this anime by accident, but the idea of a survival game using cell phones and this fascinating girl known as \"Yuno\" captivated me. The first episode went by in what felt like less than ten minutes and I thought I was going to fall absolutely in love. The episodes when on and I found myself becoming more and more interested, but at about ten that all came crashing down.\
  I started to dislike it bit by bit. It began with Amano \"Yuki\" Yukiteru believing he was falling in love with Yuno. I myself couldn't feel pity for her, not with her stalker mentality and psychotic tendancies. He himself said she was crazy in the beginning and that he wouldn't get involved, but somehow or another he was able to completely throw that aside to give himself to her. How..how do you look past something like that?\
  Many people apparently do pity Yuki for ending up in the game at all, but I can't. I just can't. He made his bed and he ended up having to lie down in it.\
  In the end he turned into this complete brat who was willing to twist the entire world just to be with this insane girl and have his parents back. He even shot his friends who only wanted to help him and make him see what was really going on.\
  I will admit I loved characters such as Akise and Minene, but they only got so much screen time. It's honestly sad when you find yourself hating the two main characters in the end and wanting/begging for them to die.\
  I didn't get my wish. The final episodes were what made me score this anime the way I am. I found Yuki to be irritating, Yuno to be too obsessive, and parts of this whole thing to be pointless.\
  I wish it had gone in a better direction, because this \"love story\" just wasn't worth it.\

Okay before I start here I do not want to spoil anything for anyone if they are not ready.

        The game involves the 12 going at it like animals in survival of the fittest. I really love the aspect of this whole anime in general. This plot is simple but yet its not about the game. No the main story is the words \"Maybe one day when we're older.\" This quote only shows when will the day actually come when our dreams and futures unfold and that is what this anime is trying to say. It says you never know whats going to happen until it happens and thats what made the story of this so good. Towards the end of the game is when I had no idea what was right or wrong. The twists of the end game  mind boogled me than any other anime could. If you don't understand any of this, watch the anime, the 10/10 is worth it.\
Art 10/10\
Damn son this anime was sadistically beautiful. No matter how I looked at it they did everything right with how this anime looked. No hiding or anyhting it is clear and beautiful. Simple as that and if you don't understand, watch the anime 10/10 is worth it.\
Sound 10/10\
Usually Sound always does good for me but in this anime has one of the best assortment of music. Its generic for an anime to have good music but I don't know the whole line-up made me feel what this anime is all about and if you don't understand, watch the anime, 10/10 is worth it.\
Character 10//10\
This is what I loved the most about this anime. Hell if there was an option this would get an 11/10. This anime by far had the most unique cast of characters and you know what, I enjoyed them all. I won't talk about all of them but I will only scratch at the ones who got to me the most. Yuno and Yuki. These two had the biggest impact on me while I was watching the anime. Yuki is an average shy and sort of pathetic kid who can be easily manipulated. He has no friends and like a lot of kids with his abnormalities the main cause was his parents divorcing. Out of all the characters you would think he would be the first to die but then comes Yuno. She is a very pretty, smart girl who is obsessed with Yuki. Obsessed probably isn't even a strong enough term to describe how she loves Yuki. She takes matters in her own hands to protect Yuki even if that means keeping him isolated from friends or family. Their relationship seems forced from the start of the anime but over time through the anime Yuki seems to fall for her. Thats what I love how your ot very sure what the status is between them. If anything above does not say 10/10 this section should. The development between every character and relationships throughout must mean something and damn do they not make an amazing anime.\
Overall 10/10\
I downright loved every single piece of this anime. I'm so glad I got the chance to watch this masterpiece. If you haven't seen this anime you NEED to. Trust me it is the best thing you will probably see and if you have seen the anime watch the OVA Redial. The ending is not complete  until you see the OVA as an extra bonus to this series. \

    Future Dairy is the shit watch it now review over I guess you want details. Future Dairy in my opinion is the anime that could close out the entire anime genre because it is the greatest anime ever made, but with that being said I guess I should explain why I think that. Future dairy is a psychological survival horror anime at its core but weaves together action, suspense and romance as well to bring you this perfect sense of emersion that will have you want to finsh it in one sitting. I love future dairy because of how perfectly paced it is and how\

    By far my favorite anime of all times.\
Characters-10\
 The characters are amazing and very deep, even the side characters. Though Yuki is quite the wimp and not the cool, amazing character like ichigo, naruto, etc., his loyalty and morals are good enough. Yuno's badass personality also makes up for Yuki's. \
Plot-10\
The plot is pretty creative and so is the whole story line idea. 12 dairies which can predict the future, the last survivor becomming god... what can be better. There's love, friendship, betrayal and everything a good anime has.\
Every character has their own plot and has their story intertwined into the series.\
Art/Sound-10\
The Art and Sound\
          \
        is creative/original. Every Character's voice is perfectly matched especially Yuno with her normal and stalker crazy voice. =)\
Enjoyment-11\
can't even begin. Once i started, i got soo hooked that i rewatched the 3rd and 4th episode 4 times... The storyline is very unpredictable yet amazing.Though, i did finish the manga and it makes you love the series even more because Yuno happens to be not as crazy as you think. Every question (there are many) that you have are all answered in the end, so just be patient. The plot was well thought out. \

    Mirai Nikki is truly a work of art. if you are reading this review and are on the fence about watching it, go watch it. right now. dont even finish the review.  go watch it. why are you still here? go watch it!\
moving forward...\
to me, it is like Death Note and The Hunger Games had a baby. Mirai Nikki is intense every moment of it, it has romance, every character - even the minor ones - have a back story, and it is twisted and demented in a good way. \
if you want an anime that will both make you cry, get scared and\
          \
        make you laugh, this is the perfect anime for you. and also i recommend not looking it up on wikipedia as that is what i did (i know im a dumbass) and i unintentionally read a major spoiler and it pissed me off because all i wanted was to see the episode list! \
either way, i give Mirai Nikki a 10/10.\

    Mirai Nikki is one of my favourite animes, it is a gore /romance /drama /action anime .. yeah a lot of stuff.. does it excels at everything? I will explain every point. \
Story: 9/10. It may seem \"wtf is this\" at the beginning, because it's really confusing, but i believe that the story has no plot holes and everything gets the right explanation sooner or later. Don´t worry if it seems boring during the first episodes, because it is a litle boring because it's confuse. Once you get the plot, around the 5th episode, this anime just gets better and better until the end. \
The\
          \
        story is a little bit complex and it may seem stupid .. well if you are of those who criticise everything and just likes slice of life (animes close to reality) well then yes it is stupid. If you are like me, a open mind, you will say \"this is actually cool\".. the plot for me was really creative and original.\
Character:9/10. Probably you already heard about Gasai Yuno .. no? Well look in the web for this name and see the pictures xD .. she is just one of the most known characters of all time.. why ? Because she is not a clichê .. she is totally different from everything that i saw until now .. really a magnificent character .. \
\
She has everything that a character needs in a gore anime .. i loved the contrast between the good Yuno and the evil one and i think it matches just perfectly with her design (her design can be for a good person or a bad one, she is both good and bad so that's why the design is great) \
Besides that, as i said, she is not a clichê. Her feelings, her actions/reactions are unpredictable, and i just love that! Being incapable of guessing what's gonna happening it's just a nice thing ! She also have a brilliant development, really deep, really detailed, but it is not boring. Usually in a action anime, development is boring .. here .. it is better than the action it self.  \
Also the \"evolution\" of the other main character, Yukiteru is great. \
Throughout the anime, we can see his evolution, he starts being a pussy and then .. well i can´t tell you because i would be spoiling but there is an interesting evolution along with the plot development on Yukiteru. There is just one little problem .. during 90% of the show, Yukiteru is a pain in the ass, really anoying.. \
Sound: 8/10. Some OST are nice, reasonable. Others are \"meh\" and then we have some nice OST. But i want to talk about the 1st opening. It is just mind blowing. One of the best until now. It just looks so nice when we compare it to the anime .. just fits so well and the music it self is cool. I really loved the opening, and i belive it is well done and matches perfectly with the anime. \
Art: 7/10. The character design is not the best out there. Also the background is not good either, but they are not on the bottom of the line, i found them reasonable, neither good nor bad. In the middle so. \
Enjoyment: Well here our opinions can be extremely different. For those who like drama / horror (which are my favorite types) will find this anime outrageous. Plus we have a nice action and a nice romance. In fact, the romance here is one of the best romances i've ever saw. It just looks so different from the rest, which makes it pretty damn good. But if you like drama/romance without the horror scenes(so a normal slice life) you may not find this anime so good. Personally this anime is pretty original, creative and has great points to look at. So only if you hate horror you will dislike this anime. Moreover, this show has the best plot twist and the best ending that i've ever saw ! I will never forget this end for real !!! It has everything to be a nice ending. It is emotional, it is deep, it is so original, it just looks awesome, really it worth so much watching this show just because of this end. If you like sad endings, this one of them .. but and if you like happy endings? Well guess what this ending is both sad and happy .. just there are no words to describe this ending.\
Overall: 9/10. I recomend it, it's a great show although it has a slow start, but at the end with that great final you will love both the begining and the ending. I found on this show, the perfect balance between romance/drama and gore, it also have some funny moments and the action is good. So i don´t know what is missing in this anime ;P \

    This review doesn't contain any spoilers.\
Mirai Nikki (further referred as MN) is a phenomenon in it's own way. I mean, how often do you see an anime, which is better than the manga it adapts? I don't think it would be easy to name at least 3 such titles. Even though \"better\" is extremely subjective in it's own way. I mean, most of the people who watched this probably don't even know it's an adaptation. But this isn't the only reason, you see. I will dive deeper now.\
The story starts rather simple. There is this Yukiteru Amane boy, who enjoys staying isolated from his classmates.\
          \
        Describing himself as \"the spectator\", Yuki writes everything he sees around himself in a diary in his mobile phone. Also, Yuki often talks to his imaginary friend called Deus Ex Machina, or simply Deus sometimes, who also is a god. A slip of a tongue, when Yuki tells him he is bored living that way, leads to see by yourself.\
Twenty six episodes of MN took me 2 days to complete, even though I had to attend my university in parallel, so you can say each second of my free time was spent on them. And that is my fastest TV series so far. MN is not fast paced or rushed, but it is just so action filled I could not have stopped after I began. Time? Studies? Pfft, another crazy scene, coming right in!\
Although I think I began from a wrong end here. The main reason for this anime to become so popular and the thing people who watched this think of first when hearing about it is it's chardesign. Well, not character design in common, but a single character - a pink-haired yandere named Gasai Yuno. By the way, if you don't know what's yandere, you can google it up. Or you can just watch the anime, it's quite obvious by itself. Anyway, Yuno appears almost instantly after the series start and instantly starts kicking in with her bad-assery. She is just so so bad-ass she looks more of a main character than Yuki does. Probably the most widely-known yandere character ever, I bet you already saw Yuno somewhere. Tons of fan art of her everywhere. Just how cool every second of her is, I think, compensates for a completely stupid main character.\
One another thing is how everything fits just in. The sound, the drawings, the story. The best opening I saw so far, also. It's just that action packed. One of my fellows referred to this as to \"one large freak circus\", and this somehow fits great. I mean, there are scenes those similar to those \"strategic\" ones like in Death Note, almost shounen type fights and chases (in the positive meaning of this, of course), touching drama scenes (wow). Even \"just talks\" and those often boring parts when they try to, ugh... \"revelate\", \"expand\" characters looks extremely interesting and fun. And, of course, these SUDDEN STORY TWISTS that you are not prepared for.\
Ah, by the way, DO NOT read anything about this on the internets. The major spoiler can ruin the whole story, you see. And the story is the main plus of the series.\
Concluding the review, MN is not much of an anime, as a virus or a disease of some sort. It infects you and your head, leaving you to think of this one large action scene again and again. And to think of Yuno too. I haven't yes talked to anyone who disliked this, and I talked kind of to a lot of people about anime. Anyways, Mirai Nikki, instant classic and a must watch for everyone.\

    There's not much that needs to be said here about the general picture of this anime. Like what many other people have said, you can just safely view it as a mindless, fun, somewhat visceral entertainment despite the countless of plot-holes and logical inconsistencies. I share with the same consensus likewise. Therefore, for this show, it's a requirement for you to suspend your disbelief most of the whole anime through. There is a particular Battle-Royale vibe to it especially when you consider its \"game of survival\" concept within the story. But half the show is balanced out with romance scenes between Yuno and Yukiteru in\
          \
        which depending on how effective you find the character Yuno is portrayed as well as your perceived tone and atmosphere of the show, the relationship and scenes between them as either greatly annoying or slightly disturbing. I already mentioned what the show is like in its most basic detail so there's no need for me to elaborate deeper as others have done it to death on MAL. Instead, let me attempt on my analysis of the show's themes and messages despite its intentions being not always clear in amidst of all the self-indulgent action train-wreck scenes  . In fact, you would think from my opening lines in my review, that I'm looking at the show too hard thus contradicting my overall statements! But nevertheless...\
The supernatural concepts communicates to the viewers of the lack of a beneficial, meaningful outcome for those people looking for a “convenient” or “easy” escape. Rather it paves the way for people in being encouraged to face their own challenges; their inner demons of the past in fair terms. For this very reason, the human elements clashing with the supernatural concepts, despite initially seem to be ideal, don’t bring to the closure that the characters deservedly need. It’s all about their own personal self-redemption as a matter of fact to achieve a stable state of mind. As a result, the show emphasizes what reality is all about; there will inevitably be a fair share of hardships along the way. Each character within the show are flawed in their own ways and on a similar subject to their difficult lives, the show examines how they react to it; whether to accept or/and move on from it. Some deal with it in many different ways; whether to just leave it as it is and be passive or even to the extreme end such as violence and terror. One can argue from their perspective especially in extreme circumstances, that their justifications to dealing with life matters are just and sympathized upon regardless if it’s morally “right” or “wrong”. Consequently, the show warns about the dangers of psychological trauma that take burden on human’s lives. This is particularly the case (in the show especially) when they lose their childhood innocence and thus ultimately shapes who they are. ",

    (The following review may contain rage and spoilers. You have been warned.)\
Going into this show i thought it had potential to be a good show. I was wrong. Not only did this thing throw my expectations to the ground, it flat out pissed on them. It remains one of my least favorite anime ever. I cannot for the life of me comprehend why people like this show.\
Story (2) -  The set up is very basic, 12 people are forced into a death match where the winner becomes the next god of time. The story constantly tries to one up itself with really stupid ideas.\
          \
        One of the people in the death match named Minene Uryuu blows up the classrooms in the school one by one instead of blowing up the entire school. For the purpose of Yuno and Yuki escaping. The story can be put into four words. \"It's a terrible story.\"\
Art (6) - Standard, nothing more, nothing less\
Characters (1) - Where do i begin with this? Lets start with Yukiteru. A little dipshit who can't do anything except hide behind Yuno. Yuno is basically Yuki's babysitter/ killing machine and that's all she is. The rest of the cast consists of Hypocrites, Imbeciles and the only good character aka Tsubaki (Out of pity). At the end of the show Yuki is so sad that Yuno is gone while he can make a new Yuno because he's a God!!!! Grow a brain!!!\
Sound (6) - Ost was standard, nothing terrible but nothing really stood out.\
Enjoyment (1) -  Enjoyment, what enjoyment? This show was a complete waste of time for me. Poor decision making, an open ending (I shouldn't have to watch an OVA for a proper ending.) This show doesn't deserve to exist in the first place.\
Overall - 3.2/10 I recommend Higurashi if you want a good Horror. Don't waste your time on this. Also why is this ranked number 16 on the popularity board?\

    I would like to state that giving a '9' to Mirai Nikki is solely based off of my enjoyment of the show, despite its many problems, plot-holes, horribly written characters, and a plot that doesn't seem to know where it wants to go. In terms of pure scoring, it would be sitting at a 7.8/10, roughly an 8/10.\
At the end of the day, I really did love this show. Solid animation and decent to great soundtracks, with a plot that felt fresh and kept me on the edge of my seat wondering \"What on Earth is going on?\" I was never bored, and considering how\
          \
        sub-par the story itself was overall (no spoilers), there were certain aspects that managed to make Mirai Nikki shine.\
To those that share my for psychological/action/thriller anime, I highly recommend this anime. Just be warned that while the anime as a whole starts off solid, there are questions you will have that will never be answered, you may end up frustrated with the direction the plot will go at times, you may get irritated/infuriated by some of the characters by how poorly they were written/managed throughout, and the ending will either be a hit or a miss. \
However, I must stress this: give it a try before you decide to give Mirai Nikki a pass. It deserves that much. \
Warning: If you are not big on gory/\"excessively violent\" scenes, do not watch this anime. \

    Mirai Nikki is a great anime, and one that explores psychological backgrounds of characters, mixed with great action sequences, the supernatural, and a unique take on survival games.  It's really a tour de force of a bunch of genres, so it naturally doesn't hit the mark everywhere, but it's not meant to.  I believe those ranking the show low fail to realize, that it's not meant to be an over the top funny anime, a documentary on psychosis, or over the top epic battle sequence.  But it has elements of all of that in good measure, and comes out well balanced. \

I'm going to stop and say it's just something you should experience for yourself if you can turn off your brain for a bit.  Because something like this hasn't been done before, -even- though I think there's room for improvement(some plot holes could be filled in better, and the OVA is kinda bunk), I'll still give it a 10/10.\
I do however believe the OVA could have been far better done and rank it at 6/10.\

    Liked overrated anime like Angel Beats!, Corpse Party, Guilty Crown, Mekakucity Actors and etc? Here's an anime you can watch.\
I've had multiple people recommend this to me in the past but I was left with a disappointed point of view when I finished this anime. I honestly was surprised at the plot but the whole anime f*cked it up and it ended up like another Shinmai Maou no Testament/Absolute Duo/Akame ga Kill.\
Like I said above, I was interested at first but slowly lost interest. I don't know what type of storyline the author created but this anime just drifted towards the ecchi end like any\
          \
        other horrible production studio. To put this simply, if an anime automatically goes from normal to ecchi, it will be horrible (unless it's seinen).\
The art was decent. It wasn't bad and it wasn't good either. I loved the art in the opening but the art that the anime used seems like it came out of a horrible production studio.\
The music is probably the best part of this anime. The 1st opening was especially amazing. The voices around this anime... all I hear is \"YUKIIII\" and Yukiteru's petty whining.\
The characters are absolutely horrible. They seem as if they were stolen from any other anime. The MC is just an outright pussy boy, Yuno is the overhyped supposed \"waifu heroine\" who would do anything for the disgusting MC, and the rest are completely unimportant.\
I am not responsible for raging of any form. Have a nice day.\

    This anime is nothing short of amazing. Comparing it to more popular anime I would say it has similarities with Your Name, Death Note and Fate, but a much darker version.\
 I saw that the most upvoted reviews on this anime were really low, so I would like to talk about that at first. This anime is not for everyone. It's like really really dark and sad. It has a lot of violence, religious and sexual references. If u are under 16, or you like to see a pink anime where everyone is happy this is not for you. Many people said (which is BS,\
          \
        in my opinion) that the story is boring. Those people obviously did NOT UNDERSTAND this anime, so I think it's an unfair to criticize it. I would be happy to talk to anyone who brings some logic arguments that this is a bad anime, but it's not.\
There we're some aspects I didn't like. First, was the main character which is probably, the biggest wimp in anime history in the 1st half of the series. Second, was the ending which I think we, as the viewers, would deserve to see a bit of a happier ending. However, both these \"flaws\" we're on purpose, and they did make sense, since this is a dark and sad anime.\
Why do I say this anime is truly a masterpiece? Well, it has everything you would expect. A diverse set of characters, which develop as the plot go on. 90% of the character developed some major changes from start to end. It had two unexpected  moments which just made go like \"Whaaattt!?\". It had probably the most lovable psychopath I have ever seen. It had the balls to address some really creepy stuff in our society, with no regards towards the regards of me as a viewer. (which some of u might hate, but from me it just gains my respect)\
I say this again, if u don't want a happy story and above 16 (no offense, most kids under 16 would probably not understand the plot), you HAVE to WATCH this.\
If the writer of this amazing anime ever sees this I would like to tell him he's done an amazing job. :) This has become one of my favorite anime.\

It isn't my style in the slightest, fast paced, shallow plot, pretty average everything... But I want to give it a 10 for whatever god forsaken reason. \
Characters have little to no time to develop, but I remember them anyway. It was fairly simple, but tragic enough for me to grow attached to each character despite their negligible screen time.\
Plot is super basic and rushed, but it was short sweet and to the point.\
This anime is a mess of different tropes and frankly, it is exactly what you'd expect.\

    NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW :)\
Personally, I found this a really amazing anime and recommend it completely. If you enjoy dark, psychological anime with a drop of romance or ship couples easily; this is definitely one for you! \
DISLIKES: The start was very slow. I watched it all in about 2 days, but I found it took me quite a while to get really into it; about a good 6 episodes. This is the ONLY reason i can't give it a 10 overall. However, when i got into it, I REALLY GOT INTO IT!! \
LOVED: I loved all the themes it included, especially the survival\
          \
        game aspect and the fact it's filled with very unexpected twists which are extremely intelligent. The characters (especially YUNO) blew me away with their likability and their uniqueness. The art is beautiful as well; if anything the best I've seen in a anime. \
OVERALL: This anime is a MUST WATCH! My advice is that you make a pizza to entertain you through the first few episodes, but after that you'll get so into you will most likely throw the pizza out the window. This 100% is my favourite anime to date!\

    We all had that one friend. The one who was a bit weird and maybe sort of smelled, too, but he still tried so, so hard to be liked by everyone. He made up all kinds of bullshit to make himself look cool, jumped into conversations to add some witty remarks, always doing his best to be noticed and make an impression. Of course, he failed spectacularly most of the time. \
You still couldn’t help but love him, because underneath all that you could see a very interesting and worthwhile guy. Or maybe because someone who tries so hard deserves something in return. Possibly both.\
Well,\
          \
        Mirai Nikki is pretty much that feeling. Sort of. At times it’s not.\
Bear with me, we’ll get through this.\
Mirai Nikki is a 2011 show, production by Studio Asread, adapted from a so-so manga (or so I’m told) from 2006 with a very cool premise: 12-people battle royale where everyone is able to see their own future via cellphones, hence the name ‘Future Diaries’. The last man standing will become the new God of Time and Space or something like that.\
Our protagonist, Yuki, is an anti-social good-for-nothing fuckwad that I would most likely place three or four steps below Shinji Ikari in the anime foodchain. He’s selected to enter the fray by chance, and somehow is not the first one to drop dead. \
Meet Yuno, a pink-haired chick who’s crazy good at fighting, crazy uncaring of other people lives’, and crazy in love with him. The two form an unlikely yet effective couple in order to see the whole thing through to the end. Synopsis, done.\
Mirai Nikki is, as one would probably expect from a story about lunatics trying to slaughter each other, schizophrenic. I mean, everything is. The characters are schizophrenic, the pacing is schizophrenic, the tone is all over the place. \
Ranging from the most absurd and deliberate camp (6-year-old serial killer, mind-controlled dogs, nurse hiding rockets under her skirt, and I could go on forever) to the oh-so-dark and tragic backstories of the Diary users, who seemingly are not allowed have a past without including violence, multiple rapes and disgustingly twisted family issues. You are supposed to laugh, then cry, then laugh again, and after a while I was having such a hard time reacting to all the nonsense happening on screen that I stopped caring. Loads of useless characters pop out of nowhere without accomplishing anything, Diary Users can’t make up their mind on whether they’re good or evil, the romance between Yuki and Yuno keeps switching between ‘chillax’ mode and ‘WHAAAAT’, making their whole relationship charming and weird at the same time.\
The cast is, overall, a mixed bag. Most of the participants are tokens with some very peculiar design choices and fucked up personalities that burst in, try to put together some silly plan, and get killed shortly afterwards. Some are fleshed out more than others (by which I mean they had some unfathomably yet unnecessarily horrible flashbacks), but in the end they’re just pawns to be disposed while marching towards the big finale. I LOVED Minene for some unexplained reason and enjoyed MurMur’s screentime, but in a ‘lol cool’ kind of way rather than ‘Such exquisite character development.’ one. Bite me.\
Main characters. Romance, then. I guess it sits fine with me in the end. Yuki is, uh, abysmal as a protagonist. All he does is crying, running way, and acting silly until the last few episodes or so. He has no depth to speak of, no interesting quirks, nothing at all. You’ll find yourself cheering for some of the other twats during the battles, which might have actually been the point. Who knows. \
Yuno is very likeable and unique, the series’ strongest point. However, since all she says and does is somehow related to her beloved, she ends up losing steam after a while. I can’t quite grasp why the couple works, yet it does. They’re quite bad individually, but since they’re together 99% of the time, flaws and silliness shine less bright and become more bearable.\
The final bits, mainly focusing around their relationship, are easily the best ones out of the whole bumpy ride.\
Technically there’s not much to speak of. Again, quality dips and rises episode to episode, and I would rate it average overall. Animation is wonky at times, camera work is by-the-numbers. Good backdrops, though. \
It’s in perfect sync with the rest of the show: highs and lows, rinse and repeat. \
EDs and OPs are alrighty (first OP is the standout for nagging the themes with both visuals and song). Sound design and OST are, unfortunately, bad.\
To wrap it up, I’d say Mirai Nikki is crap. A very good kind of crap, though. \
It tries sooooo damn hard, showing you how gritty and mature it is, how despicable and pathetic its characters are, and you’re just there asking him to please, please be done with it quick, you have lunch sitting in the oven and cats' videos to watch and pressing matters to attend to. \
It’s similar to a kid doing his best to ape what adults do, and making a commendable, but poor impression. You can’t have a pulpy do-or-die love story inside a B-movie. Or it might be the other way around. Hard to say.\
Still, my very personal opinion is that it oozes with effort, and love for its setting and backstories and fight scenes, and I’ll be freaking DAMNED if you manage to find another show that had me laughing so hard at a sexual abuse flashback, just because it’s all so stupid and trashy yet entertaining in its own deranged ways. \
It was an effort for me to elaborate on this show. I can see all its numerous flaws quite clearly, but can’t bring myself to hate it. Its heart is in the right place and that’s more than enough for  good ol’ softie here.\
Anyhow, this is a review, so I have to stick some random number on Mirai Nikki’s bumber. \
I’d say it sucks, but I’m glad I watched it. Just like that dude back in the day who wasn’t that great but you still enjoyed talking to him.\

    This is my first anime that made me become an animelover then now, its become my first anime to be review in MAL. \
Before watching this anime, I've watching through popular animes that aired on my country but none of all made me interested to wacth another anime (just watch few episodes then drop it). One thing that made me interested to this anime, is the famous main heroin that appears on a meme when the anime was airing. I though this girl must be a unique character since I don't ever or even know what yandere is before, and thats made me curious. 5\
          \
        years after that, I finally found a way to watch this anime.\
I love the first opening song, its very match the anime's theme. The art is also nice for that year then the story... for me its very awesome, since I though cause I didnt really like anime at that time, I will drop it. But to be honest I've wacth the entire episodes 3 times in a week then the feel of this anime fill my  heart for almost a month after wacthed Mirai Nikki. The story I though not filled with heavy plot for newcomer like me, its (almost) easy to understand.\
You will enjoy what the meaning of \"I wanna be with you forever no matther how, what happends and what I want is just only you, you and you\". Since it is a romance anime, that is the only thing that I cant found in other romance anime (maybe I'll found later). \
The action is good but it should be better. \
Overall, this is a very awesome anime, especially for newcomers that want to lure themselves to this dark world(haha kidding). Thats all I can write, sorry for my English and thanks.\

    Reading the other reviews on here, I can't help but feel they are a little harsh. I personally adored this show with a burning passion. I am a film major, so I've studied story and writing a few years now. Don't know if that strengthens my reasoning behind this review or not, but here it is nonetheless:\
Future Diary is a constant thrill ride. It contains lovable characters (yes, even the antagonists), drama on every corner, and a mind-blowing story. It starts off simple, they have these phones that tell their future. But from there on, things take a wide and drastic turn. Again, I pretty\
          \
        much liked every single character, and I don't know if I could even pick a favorite or not. We'll start off talking about Yuno though: she's adorable, right? She's likable, she's cute, and she's also a cold-blooded psychopathic murderer. But we still love her. Why? Good story writing, that's why. Though at first, viewers may be mildly annoyed by her stereotypical display of obsessive girl liking a boy, we quickly learn the concept is so much more beyond that. Yuno is NEVER the damsel in distress, she is a hardcore future diary game player with a dark past and even darker future. Everything she does, she does for the idea of love. She goes through such extreme measures simply because, she cannot handle a world without her true love. It's actually pretty simple when thinking of it in this sense, yes? We've all seen the unthinkable happen when it comes to love and passion right? Now take that unthinkable and TRIPLE it. It really masters the ability to make viewers wonder, would I do all this for the person I love the most? Do I support these actions being taken? Do I sympathize with these characters or do I despise them? It makes your brain whirl, and that's what I love about this show the most. On the surface, this show is so simple, but underneath, it contains so much depth and intricacy it's hard to even comprehend, let alone write a review about. One of my other most beloved characters in this show is Minene. She easily has the biggest character arc, and the most spunk. She starts off as our number one antagonist, by by the end, is one of our dearest friends. We see her life and her values take big shifts and we see her grow in such a beautiful way. And of course I should probably go ahead and talk about Yuki, right? Our big number 1 protagonist. Us viewers feel to be in the exact same position as him at all times. Never once do you get a chance to think \"what the hell Yuki? Are you insane?\" Because just like him, we really never KNOW what the right choice is. We are just as confused and perplexed as he is the entire time. It makes for a much more exciting ride too, I must say. And more entertaining as well. The only negative thing I think I could even say about this show is on Deus Ex Machina himself. The idea of him is well, of course... a deus ex machina? He literally just appears and the future diary game appears. Get it?  And while the concept of that is incredibly intriguing, it was a little hard for me to follow at some points. That, and the never-ending adorableness of MurMur. Hopefully I didn't spoil too much here. Moral of the review: give this show a shot. It gives you way more than you could ever expect. I think it's easily one of the best animes (and shows in general) that I have ever seen. \

    First off when I first came across this show I thought what a stupid looking show, fortunately though I decided to watch this masterpiece.\
The story starts off with Yukiteru Amano, a shy teenager with a lack of social skills who is always entering entries into his cell phone. He usually spends his time at home talking to his imaginary friends Dues Ex Machina and Murmur, to his shock he finds out his imaginary friends are actually real and Dues bestows upon him the Random Diary which allows him to tell the future. He seems to enjoy this diary at first at least until he gets\
          \
        a Dead End which foretells his death. Now part of a deadly game where he must slay the other 11 diary holders or die himself, he must now fight to  survive with the help of his stalker Yuno Gasai who also has a diary herself. Throughout the series the show manages to keep you guessing with multiple plot twists (especially at the end) and great characters as well as having a solid amount of action and romance.\
The characters in the show really work well with eachother as they all have their reasons for participating in the dangerous game or for helping Yukiteru and Yuno survive it. First Yukiteru Amano, he starts out a really weak and shy kid but after being in the game for a bit with Yuno, he progressively gets stronger and even at moments in the series really shines as a character. He doesn't trust or even like Yuno, but as the story progresses he really begins to fall in love with her. He is the perfect character to complement Yuno's character.\
Yuno Gasai is just a girl in love to the point where she is willing to kill anyone who tries to take her beloved away from her or anyone who tries to hurt Yukiteru. Yuno is driven by her love for Yukiteru and is willing to sacrifice her own life to protect his if the situation calls for it. Throughout the series Yuno does her best to kill the other diary holders so that her love can become God, even though it will mean her eventual death. Her progression throughout the story coupled with the fact that she is a mystery throughout the show allows her to be a character that is able to at times just be a young girl who is love and wants to be with Yukiteru and at times ready to kill anyone who stands in the way of her goal indiscriminately.\
The diary holders also provide excellent additions to the story since they all have their own goals and plans in mind to become God. The stories for the diary holders allow you to see from their side and give you a good understanding to why they have chosen to what they have. This allows the story to have characters that are not bland but have a reason for being that way, you might think they are evil you might not but in the end you will understand them a bit.\
Other characters throughout the series provide great support to the story as well such as Aru Akise and Yukiteru's other friends as they try to find out the mystery behind Yuno and protect him from her if need be.\
The art of the show was wonderful in my opinion as well as having great openings and closings for each half of the show. The animation was fluid and style really helps you get the emotion of the scene.\
Overall it is an extremely good show and very enjoyable at times, there is thrilling action and at times everyone is trying to find out the mystery behind the next diary holder. If you like anime that contains action, romance, or even just mysteries this show provides all of that. If you watch the show and enjoy it it is a good idea to watch the Mirai Nikki Redial OVA to get the true ending to the series.\
I would highly recommend this show to anyone.\

    This will contain spoilers...\
I was stuck between a 9 and 10 (going by my standards). I had reasons defending both scores and I had to go with my heart over my mind. The only reason I had doubts for the score of 10 was the nudity. Not all moments were necessary such as the spa scene in episode [13]. The only part of the entire anime that I found \"necessary\" was the sex scene in episode [23] between Yuki and Yuno. It was bound to happen and personally I was hoping it would because throughout the whole anime you could see a true love relationship\
          \
        developing and to be honest that sealed the deal for both parties considering Yuki kept having second thoughts about truly falling in love with Yuno. Back to the topic at hand, what pushed me over the fence to decide to go with 10 was indeed episode [23]. Without the intimate scene between Yuki and Yuno, I wouldn't have had the reasoning to overlook the random nudity throughout the anime. Now for my reasoning behind why I wanted to give it a 10 in the first place, every moment I thought something was going to happen 50% of the time I was correct... except for a random plot twist such as about the bodies found in Yuno's house. I was right about 2 of 3 being her parents and was shocked that the third body was the original Yuno and was murdered by the 1st alternate world Yuno. Just to round this up I appreciated the ending how everyone who participated in the game got what they truly wanted in the 3rd alternate world and how 2nd alternate world Yuki was found by Yuno in the void of space and time. So in the end game, I would definitely recommend this to someone who want to watch something with disturbing twists.\

    Alright, I'm gonna make this review as short and simple as possible without trying to spoil anything.\
Story (4) - I'll admit the whole predicting the future with your cellphone thing was kinda cool to begin with but it lost its touch quite early on. Also there are so many plot holes in this series and bits that aren't explained enough. \
Art (7) - Decent art, better than most series I guess. I found that the art shined the most during the end of the series when there were more fight scenes.\
Sound (7) - Again, decent sound, this series kind of depends on how good looking\
          \
        it is in hopes that the viewer will dismiss the amount of plot holes there are and continue watching.\
Character (4) - Ughh, alright the only reason I'm not giving it a 3 is because of *drumroll* Yuno. If you ask people about why they liked this series, 90% of the time they'll say something along the lines of \"I really enjoyed Yuno\" or \"Yuno was pretty cool\". Well Yuno was cool... At least for the majority of the series. But if you ask me, everyone else was kind of, meh (except maybe Yomotsu who was kinda funny). Indeed Yuno was cool and I really enjoyed her screen time, but I don't think that she was able to make up for the rest of the faults in this series.\
Enjoyment (3) - Yea I didn't really enjoy this one too much, in fact it kind of felt like a chore watching it at times. I will admit though, I did find the first few episodes of the series actually quite enjoyable :) But unfortunately, for me, the series grew duller and I felt it sidetracked too much, especially towards the end.\
Overall (4) - Idk what the deal with this series is. By looking at the amount of fan support this series has, I guess you could say that you either love it or you hate it. For me, I have mixed feelings. I really enjoyed the first few episodes of this series but there are just so many plot holes that follow that I just can't dismiss. Tbh though, I think the only really good/memorable thing that came out of this series was the character Yuno, who I unfortunately think was ruined during the end of the series.\

    Mirai Nikki was dreadful for me to watch, and I didn't enjoy anything from it at all. It had a potentially great story, only to be executed badly. Accompany that with ignorant annoying characters, nudity, multiple rape scenes, and failed comedy attempts to make me laugh, you have this anime. What redeems Mirai Nikki from getting a 2 from me however, is it's beautiful art and alright soundtrack.\
The story basically is, 12 people are given devices known as \"Future Diaries\", cellphones that have the ability to tell the future, predict movements, etc. Not only that, but they are chosen to participate in a death game\
          \
        where they all have to kill each other. Last person standing gains the position of God.\
From the outside view, I thought I would end up liking this anime. However, after 26 episodes, I was ultimately proven wrong.\
The biggest problem for me were the two main characters, Yuki Amano, a shut-in 8th grad boy that writes in his diary all day, and Yuno Gasai, another 8th grade girl with perfect marks in school. They both could be single-handedly the worst written characters that I have EVER seen. \
Yuki does absolutely nothing beneficial. His decision making skills are on point with Nigel Farage. Some of the things that Yuki has done are so stupid that it's actually mind boggling. What's strange is that he's paranoid and a complete wuss for about half of Mirai Nikki, and then the last couple episodes his personality does a full turn around, where he's comfortable knowing that he shot and killed three of his best friends. When he's in a fight, he is completely useless. The best thing I've seen him do is stab someone in the abdomen. That's it. Other than that, he leaves all the fighting to his unbelievably overpowered and strong lover, Yuno.\
Yuno is the Mary Sue of this anime. Although she may not be as annoying or bad as Yuki through understandable story telling, Yuno still makes absolutely no sense. She does all the fighting for Yuki, out of her love for him. Apparently, she has more combat experience than those in the military or police force, with no explanation. She might as well be completely invulnerable to anything and everything, except when someone touches Yuki. For example, for kissing him, you get your throat cut open. That's nice.\
Both these characters have so many episodes dedicated into developing their backstories, yet they still make no sense and end up leaving us with more questions. In fact, I liked the supporting characters more than the main ones. \
There will be spoilers in this paragraph. I will be talking about the story and the rest of the character cast. For me, the story was awkwardly painful. Many of the Future Diary Holders have no development. Take a look at a character named Bacchus. He is suddenly introduced and forced into the viewer's face as the anime begins to highlight him for the last couple of episodes. All we know is that Yuno and Yuki are on a mission to eliminate him and Eighth. Then it proceeds without telling us any information or why. I also need to mention that the story-telling is awful. They left me with so many unanswered questions that I cant count. By around 10 episodes in, I had stopped taking Mirai Nikki seriously. \
Thanks for reading.\

    This is a shitty review about a shitty anime and im just writing it because I felt like telling everyone how much I hate Mirai Nikki.\
It seems interesting at first, I mean diaries that can see the future is kind of cool ... I guess. But urgh, no, the story is shit, it doesnt make any sense and the characters are boring and annoying af. I've never met a more annoying MC then the one in Mirai Nikki, Yuki. Hes useless and does barely anything, maybe he did but maybe I also stopped caring at that point. But Yuno is even more annoying, I know\
          \
        shes a yandere and shes just like that and thats what makes her so popular. But she killed the most likable character in this anime, the character that I didn't actually hate, poor Akise. And while Yuno goes around killing everyone what does Yuki do? Nothing. Yeah. \"Oh, you wanna kill my mom? Sure! Go ahead! I will still love you in the end.\" Fuck off.\
Words can not describe the hate I have for this anime. I think I'll stop here. Just trust me, this anime is super popular, but don't, just don't watch it. It's absolute shit. Id rather you go watch Pupa. Even that's better than this.\

    Long time I wanted to express my opinion about this anime. Below can be only found an incoherent text which do NOT contain any spoilers after that you can not watch the anime already, however, read on your own risk. Text imply that you have read description of the anime. \
Some people say that this anime don't answer on a lot of questions which can appear while or after watching. They are right but who said that an anime should ask on every question of its plot? If the creators of anime told everything about some characters and their history, about some reasons, the characters\
          \
        couldn't be that enigmatic, that allogenic to their world, I see no reason why every character should become familiar to a viewer. What was mentioned by others is that the most of characters don't have really planned strategy and don't do all that can be done with their potential power. But this only adds verisimilitude to anime's plot. They're just like real people who make a lot of mistakes. Somebody will say who the hell will be interested while watching anime about ordinary life and people? Well, how the hell are you watching daily routine genre then?\
Talking about main character, he is pretty weak young boy, however, he is not typical Japanese pupil and, of course, feared by the situation, like would be feared every normal person. He is selfish, in my opinion, and mostly thinks about his own good but he suffered a lot himself, which fact, he thinks, can justify him. In some way he is right, he didn't choose to participate in this game. The anime allots big part of screen time to his experience and feelings. Maybe nobody cares about feelings of a fictional character but anyway this can make us think about some things.\
The atmosphere of anime is pretty dark. All these empty streets, faceless passers-by, empty buildings. Especially closer to the end of the anime, there was shown almost no dwellers.\
It shows the psychological side of this anime. Creators did they best in their attempts to create dark, dismal setting. Maybe while you are watching the anime you don't feel unusually happy, but anime brings up themes about life and death, about pain. Of course not everyone will like this anime. \
This even can be hard to watch this anime closer to the end for sensitive people. Nevertheless, this anime is a good thriller, I don't think it's boring to watch the anime. That anime made me watch almost every episode with with strong tension. We all love comedies, but anime like that teachs us to value life, the most valuable thing in the world.",

    Don't look at Yukki, don't talk to Yukki, don't touch Yukki, don't smell Yukki, don't think about Yukki, don't even come near Yukki at all, otherwise she will be there... TO KILL YOU! Mirai Nikki has my head all twisted up and in shambles because I am unsure how to review this. It was good, very good in fact. It had so many hilarious moments and crazy plot twits that I did not see coming. However, there were a few parts, mostly the ending, that had me second guessing as to whether or not this anime was actually good or not. The story was probably\
          \
        the best part of this anime hands down. It felt as if it was something new and fresh, that it had never been done before, and I like that. Nevertheless, there were a few moments that seemed unfit for how the story was playing out, as if it just happened because the creators thought it was funny or clever and just threw it in where it would seem necessary. However, that does not take away from the overall story line experience. It was still well thought out with many twists and turns, it made me wanting to see more; up until the very end though. The characters were good, some better than others, but some were just blah to me. Of course one of the main characters, the cra cra woman herself, Yuno, was probably the most fascinating of them all (I think we can all agree on that). She, however, was not my favorite of the bunch of characters that were introduced. There were moments where she was a little TOO cra cra for my liking, but I think that she made the show, no doubt about that. The other main character Yukiteru was okay, nothing special until the very end. I didn't hate him, but his 'oh I am so helpless' personality was rubbing me the wrong way. As for the other characters they all had a very interesting story, and they all seem to fit perfectly into this 'game' they were playing. I was pleased that they actually had background stories for each character, so in the end they almost all seem to matter. (By the way my favorite was Ninth ;)) Then came the last few episode of this series. I will admit I did not see the ending coming at all, but it was an unsuited 'I did not see it coming.' While the final episode was actually quite pleasant, except for maybe that final moment with Yukiteru (but I will not spoil it), the episodes leading up to the very last were truly disappointing. Seriously, the reason behind this whole 'game' of the future diaries was ridiculous, at least to me. I felt as if they came to a stand still and were not sure how to end it, but they figured that it was the best and most 'logical' way it could have all happened. I am sorry but no, I was expecting something crazier, but in the end I am left with nothing but bs for everything that had happened in the series. Oh and also the censorship was exceedingly unnecessary!   \
Overall, the story was great to me until the final few episodes came into play. It was ruined for me from there but the very final episode was a pleasant, sort of satisfying, surprise. The art was good, nothing great though to talk much about it. The music was decent, it could have been better with more dramatic music (like the first opening credits theme) but it was not awful. The characters were very pleasing. I enjoyed almost all of them because they all seemed to have played an important role, no matter how minuscule their air time was. The enjoyment was definitely there, it was a very worthy experience through almost the whole anime. Even though this anime leaves me second guessing as to how well it was, I was mostly content with the series and would recommend to watch it.      \

    This anime had so much missed potential, I had to write a review explaining why it deserves such a low overall score. So let's start with the score breakdowns:\
Story: 5/10\
Never mind the fact that Mirai Nikki lacks any real setup or background information for its battle royale plot (unlike Fate/Zero, which at least sets up the scene and conditions for the Grail Wars), it also has huge glaring plot holes that defy logic and intuition of human behavior. You are often left wondering how the hell some characters (especially Yuuki, the shitty/useless protagonist) could possibly do or not do such a thing, given their predicaments.\
          \
        But this isn't even the worst part, nor is it the cause for why I couldn't enjoy this anime from Episode 2. Besides all that, I thought the concept of different types of Future Diaries was pretty interesting, and definitely had a lot of potential that was absolutely ruined by the main protagonist. But I'll get to that later.\
Art: 8/10\
Not much to say here. The art is crisp and colorful enough, even though certain scenes could have used more details (especially landscape shots). The characters' expressions are also well-drawn, although at times the characters themselves felt like they were drawn haphazardly. \
Sound: 7/10\
Decent, but not great by any means. The background music assists in accenting the tone of the scenes, but it does not add to the emotion expressed, nor does it evoke any emotion from the viewer.\
Character: 6/10\
Actually, I probably would have given this section an 8/10 if it weren't for the utterly despicable and hopeless character that is the main protagonist, Amano Yuukiteru. But I'll get to that. Let's consider a few characters that actually make this anime interesting:\
Gasai Yuno: A violent girl with a violent past who is fanatically devoted to Yuuki. I can overlook the obsessive and violent nature of her love for Yuuki, which actually begins to make sense when you see her past with her parents, and how Yuuki is now all that she has left. Although she does make me sick in the stomach sometimes, I understand that this is part of her extremely interesting character.\
Uryu Minene: A terrorist who actually works on the side of the protagonist for a while. She also has an interesting, tragic past that contributes to her character development and the attempted character development of Yuuki. Her actions are a direct result of her beliefs, and I have no problem with being able to see how she thinks and acts under the influence of her lonely past, and it gives us all a different perspective.\
Kurusu Keigo: A top dog detective who acts for the sake of his family. A necessary and interesting component to the plot, and an interesting character himself. Not much to complain about.\
Akise Aru: My absolute favorite choice for replacing Yuuki as the main protagonist. Akise is an aspiring detective with a brilliant mind to match. It is truly a shame that he is nothing more than a supporting character for a very brief amount of time, especially relative to the disgusting amount of time wasted on Yuuki.\
I haven't even gotten to Ikusaba Marco and Mikami Ai yet, and already this list of non-Yuuki characters is looking like an excellent mix of personalities and backgrounds. And now we get to the biggest piece of shit in the entire anime...\
Amano Yuukiteru: Where do I even begin. Ignoring the fact that Yuuki remains a useless, development-less character for the better part of half the anime, I was shocked to see Yuuki actually REGRESS from character development in Episode 18. He gained some level of resolve (after being a completely pathetic, logic-defying dumbass) but lost it in a grand total of 10 seconds. All in one episode. Wow. If you're familiar with the Hero's Journey character development cycle, you will understand when I say that Yuuki essentially spends 10 episodes in the Abyss and comes out of the wrong side and regresses back into his worthless, hateful self. Primarily because he was so worthless and detestable in this anime, receiving no character development and a TON of screen time, Amano Yuukiteru single-handedly destroyed my enjoyment of the anime, as well as the individual score of the Character section.\
Enjoyment: 3/10\
Once again, I probably would have rated it much higher (8+) if it wasn't for Amano Yuukiteru. He represents all that a main character should not be. I couldn't care less if he was a side character with less screen time, but the fact that he was the main protagonist and received a disproportionate amount of screen time that could have been for other interesting characters is just an abomination.\
Overal: 4/10\
Please don't watch Mirai Nikki if you hate hating protagonists.\

    My review will contain 2 parts.\
Part 1 will be my usual review.\
Part 2 will contain SPOILERS.\
ok first of all: everyone who is going to watch Mirai Nikki... i really recommend watch every episodes 'at once' / 'without interruptions'.\
all 26 episodes will take ~10h50mins (11h).\
if you dont watch all episodes at once in a day pls make sure you might watch it in 2-3 days (like 5,5h/4h a day). the story is definitely not easy to understand so this will help you have a better understanding. (This way you wont forget much. its important not to forget things out of older episodes, every detail is important\
          \
        for the development of the story.\
REVIEW PART 1\
I really liked this anime. It was exciting and thrilling (well i guess both words are kinda same haha but yeah thats how it was. Emotional and confusing at the same time. everything is happening unexpected and kinda change the whole view on the things. well, as i said it is confusing your feelings will have sudden up and downs.\
Story 10/10 without doubt... this story is complex. not easy to understand. its not a simple love-story or a survivalgame-story. this is going deeper than it seems. i will say it again: try to watch all episodes at once... do not hold on this anime so long.\
Art 8/10 there is a small number of CGI usage, which most of anime viewers (including me) dont like, big disapointment. otherwise... the \"normal\" animtion was pretty good.\
Sound 9/10 mix of classical, experimental and electronic sounds which match perfectly to the anime. giving us an exciting feeling.\
Character 10/10 just watch and see it by yourself. awesome character development. wow\
Enjoyment 9/10 YEP definitely!\
OVERALL 9/10 Great!\
Read PART 2 if you already watched Mirai Nikki\
REVIEW PART 2 - SPOILER WARNING\
As i said the whole story isnt easy to understand, Mirai Nikki is a complex anime.\
Maybe because of the timetravel? i think Mirai Nikki is complicated in many ways, but timetravel is one point in this anime.\
Well, as we see Mirai Nikki is using the \"Many-worlds interpretation\" of timetraveling, its a practicable way to make timetraveling possible. \
take a look at ---> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation\
i think its more understandable if you are having this background information.\
in my opinion: talking about timetravel is a spoiler because this is the important plot in the story.\
All i can say, Mirai Nikki is havin a great story and i will rewatch it! Recommend for people who like super-brainfuck stories à la Christopher Nolan (with more blood, nudity, cruelty and violence xD).\

    A little torn on this anime, the anime was pretty good but would sometimes throw things your way that is contradictory to the character. I found myself really enjoying this anime then every once in a while getting hit with the \"Why did that character do that? That is completely out of character and makes no sense\" everyone once in a while. So other than inconsistent character development I'd say this is worth watching. So I'd say it's a consistent 7/10 but went with a 6/10 for inconsistencies with the characters, primarily the protagonist Yukki. The story was unique and had some good twists but\
          \
        sometimes it feels like it can be trying to hard. Art was alright, just your average anime, same with the sound design of the show. I'd say it's definitely worth the watch but don't go in expecting it to be amazing. I found myself taking breaks from it every handful of episodes, it's good just not \"Have to watch the whole thing right now!!\" good.\

    Hello All!\
For today I will be doing a 1-minute review on the highly acclaimed psychological thriller namely - Mirai Nikki (The Future Diary). Let's Go!\
STORY : 6\
This 26-episode ride starts off with a bang from the very first episode. As this is a thriller it should be standard-fare to expect twists every now and again so you will need to pay close attention to the plot, but not that it becomes an emotional burden at any stage. However, there are various plot holes and they are impossible to miss as your mind is always in 5th gear looking for that extra piece of info.\
ART :\
          \
        7\
The art-style is expected to match that of the latest anime and it does. It neither disappoints or exceeds in that aspect. There are both censored and uncensored versions available so be sure to pick up which one you prefer. Selected scenes can be gory, but not excessive as compared to some horror titles.\
SOUND : 7\
While most of the soundtrack doesn't stand out, some parts do. The opening track also deserves a special mention as it is just mesmerizing. The voice acting is done fairly well. The English dub is an utter mess.\
CHARACTERS : 7\
Most of the characters are somewhat enjoyable and development is done well in terms of screen-time. One character deserves a special mention - Yuno Gasai (voiced by Tomosa Murata) - which is truly exceptional and will get my vote as one of the best lead female roles in an anime series.\
ENJOYMENT : 8\
I've had very few dull moments in between episodes and for the most part was a very fun series to watch.\
OVERALL : 7\
Because of its obvious plot holes it subtracts to what could have been a great anime and therefor I won't recommend it for analytical viewers. As for anyone else who enjoys the genre, I recommend Mirai Nikki.",

    The Future Diary (Mirai Nikki) is one hell of a crazy and entertaining ride. But only as long as you don't look at it too closely, because you'll notice many flaws if you do.\
Characters - 7\
The main character, 14 year old Yuki, is such a wimp that he makes Shinji Ikari look manly and heroic by comparison. But he's okay otherwise. I can think of a lot more annoying main characters.\
The real star of the show is Yuki's overly attached girlfriend Yuno. She's smart, resourceful and completely unpredictable. And for some reason, she's madly in love with Yuki (pun intended).\
The main characters and their relationship\
          \
        develop over the course of the show. Yuki gets less wimpy, and Yuno gets... even more insane. There's also a wide variety of interesting and not-so-interesting side characters. Revy from Black Lagoon plays a crazy terrorist bomber and Kaworu from Evangelion plays an amateur detective.\
Story - 6\
The premise of this show is great. 12 players are selected to participate in a battle royale and given various devices that can predict the future. The winner of the game gets to become the GOD OF THE NEW WORLD (read in a dramatic voice of Light Yagami). But the execution of this idea is not that great. While the overarching story is great, there are plot holes galore and the characters are sometimes made to take unbelievably stupid actions in order to advance the plot or prevent the plot from taking an udesirable path. Also, the future-telling diaries are not really used to their full potential.\
As a side note, I feel the need to say that the police in this show are utterly useless. They completely ignore every murder that occurs and sometimes even cooperate with known criminals for their own personal.. wait, maybe this isn't such an unrealistic show after all.\
Art & Sound - 9\
The character designs are nice (except the mother from the orphanage - what the hell was that?). The animation is good and the action scenes look great. Just a warning (or maybe an incentive): there is a lot of graphic violence and shameless fanservice.\
The music was great and really helped in creating the right atmosphere when it needed to. The first opening was especially awesome.\
Enjoyment - 9\
If you can overlook the plot holes and Yuki's constant crying and Yuno yelling 'Yuki!' every 10 seconds, you should be able to enjoy this show, because it has almost every possible ingredient to make it fun and enjoyable to watch: plenty of action, crazy and shocking plot twists, lots of horror and suspense, interesting and non-conventional romance and... you know - Yuno.\

    *spoilers* yes, spoilers.\
Just hearing the name \"Mirai Nikki\" sends a shiver up my spine, the best way to describe such a show is fucked up. Girls going from cute loli princesses, into evil High-School girls that have nothing better to do than rip each other apart. Put aside the fact that everything is extremely unrealistic and makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and you've got \"Mirai Nikki\", another Romantic, Psychological Thriller that's better than twilight.\
Usually I set up my reviews in sections, but this time i thought \"Fuck it\". Lets begin.\
\
Lets get out the way and just point out that the art and sound art good.\
          \
        Nothing really to review here as it's everyone's separate opinion.\
Now, before you continue this review there is a question I've got to ask you. \
Do you like to be mindfucked so hard that you don't understand what the fuck is going on?\
If you answered yes to that question, you may as well just start the anime now because that was my initial feeling during the time spent watching.\
Mirai Nikki, an anime that for some reason I honestly don't understand, I love. The sheer amount of mindfuckery in this anime is enough to make a man explode in confusion and call the police for mental harassment. I never understood how the god of time was his dream and then real and fuck me it made no sense. I also didn't understand how they got the phones in the first place? Whatever, I might just have forgotten. Who gives a shit about the story? We got to see a cute girl go mental and kill shit. \
The characters you may ask? The main guy was a prick, but Yuno made up for him. Yukiteru, or as Yuno commonly referred to him \"Yuki!\" was one of my least favourite characters of anime, ever. Until around the end when he decided to grow a fucking pair, he couldn't do shit for himself and made Yuno do everything. Thank god for that, if he'd tried to do something he would of died, instantaneously leaving a quick end. I found the other characters (1-12) pretty average. Other than Uryuu, nothing special. Uryuu was a good character, i just didn't understand what the fuck happened with her eventually. She went insane again after calming her tits and tried to kill Yuki? If only she had succeeded, what a shame. \
Here for the biggest and bulkiest part of the review? The part that everyone scrolls down because they don't have the time and effort to look through? Kick your feet up, sip on that mountain dew and prepare for a long block of text you honestly couldn't be fucked to read.\
The Enjoyment.\
Well, as a start I can guess I can say I \"Enjoyed\" Mirai Nikki. The fight's where pretty cool, and some of the characters on their own where even cooler. It had a good idea behind it, i just think it should've been explained better. I also think that they should've used a better main character, for instance one with balls. Though, I thought the whole Yuno protecting Yuki thing was pretty cool, i've still got to mention the fact that it would've been better if Yuki could man the fuck up and do something useful. He was literally just a 100KG Stone that Yuno had to get on her knees and drag along the plot. I loved the art, I thought the dead bodies that Yuno hid looked pretty sick and the characters themselves looked well-drawn. I'm trying not to drag this review along much longer as I wouldn't want to make it painfully long to read, so the best way to put this anime is a better version of guilty crown.\
Final Conclusion: \
This show was pretty satisfying. If you're used to all the rom-com stuff, I'd strap on your seatbelt, put your dick back in your pants, and take this for a ride.\

    Well, so far my first impressions are quite positive. To be given the fact that this anime explores on the relationship between each one and another (you will see soon enough) makes it enjoyable.

    Well where can I start? After watching Mirai Nikki I have to say its my favorite anime up to date, so you know this is going to be a positive review :)\
Story: 9\
The story is absolutely great !The story Is a psychotic love thriller focusing on the two main characters Yukki and Yuno with tons of great supporting characters, a fast paced plot, a LOT of murder and gore, a plot twist that you'll never see coming, and an ending that'll leave you in tears. There are no filler episodes or any that feel that they didn't serve a purpose, and above all they were\
          \
        all extremely enjoyable. The only problems that I have with the story which are minor are that at certain points, specifically in between episodes the story can feel disjointed like as if you missed something, and there is one plot hole that I found once I had finished the series.\
Art: 10\
The Animation is simply superb, the characters are all nicely animated and crisp and the art style, especially in the Yuno Physco scenes are done perfectly, and Yukki's reaction to them is done great as well.\
Sound: 9 \
Okay seriously you know an opening theme is good when I, someone who usually always skips over the op of most animes watches it every episode, even in the middle of a 7 episode marathon. The first opening theme is my second favorite opening theme of any anime behind Cowboy Bebop's, it just fits Mirai Nikki so Perfectly. The ending songs of both season are good as well, the only bad thing is the second opening theme is kind of lame.\
Character: 10\
 Yukki the main male  lead is pretty much a big wimp which may turn off some people but it worked for the show I think, and his few redeeming moments (and by that i mean when he isn't crying behind Yuno and he actually does something heroic) were amazingly satisfying to say the least. Now the real star of the show is Gasai Yuno, The main female lead. She can go from being the cutest and sweetest girl you've ever seen to being a completely psychotic lunatic then next. Literally there will be points where you'll be like \"Holy crap what a crazy B!*ch!!\" she's whats really gets you to watch more, you'll always be wonder what Yuno's gonna do next. The character development of Yukki is greatly done, and Yuno's back story is just amazing. \
Enjoyment: 10\
If you enjoy action, great characters, a good love story, a jaw dropping plot twist, and don't mind some gore then Mirai Nikki is the show for you! Now do yourself a favor and watch this phenomenal amine! \

    Mirai Nikki aka Future Diary was my gateway anime. I read the synopsis for this seris and as sure as I was that South Park is the funniest show on television right now just above American Dad and The Simpsons, I was just as sure this is the one and only thing that could,no WILL make me watch more anime. And making pop culture references and mentioning other television shows is the way I write. When I do this I'm in my groove. No big words here or trying to sound smarter than you, I'm just going to tell you why I love this show\
          \
        and  why I think that Future Diary is one hell of a ride. This is only my second review on MAL and the first I think could've been better. I'm don't think I'm going to write another review for a while so I'm going to try my best with this.  Please if you could, let me know one or both of the following:\
-What you think of this review by itself\
- Is it an improvement over the last review, is it the same or is it worse?\
You see to me, anime was Dragonball Z, Speed Racer, Yu Gi Oh! etc. A bunch of anime for kids that adults could also enjoy. I mean before a few years ago I was pretty ignorant when it came to anime, I  grew older and the biggest mystery to me in life was why I actually worshipped Pokemon.It was childish and as I was well into puberty I thought that maybe there has to be something better Japanese animation has to offer. Don't get me wrong, I like Dragon Ball Z but it didn't get to watch anime. It has its flaws like being really repetitive and having a group characters with constiaption, but I like the mindless fun. That's not to say I can't like other genres of this type of animation.\
I still watch shonen anime like Naruto and Bleach, but Future Diary is something special.I saw the subbed version of this show. The show is a combination of action adventure, psychological thriller has bits of comedy, and can be seen as a tragedy for a lot of the characers. The show has amazing character development, a story so engaging it will keep you glued to your television screen, incredible voice acting and much more. I will try to go through what makes this show so incredible one by one and what, if an any, can be improved.\
STORY AND SETTING(Contains Minor Spoilers):\
The story kicks off with a girl being brutally murdered and a girl trying to revive a boy. This should tell you that this show will have a lot af violence and killing. The story then takes us to present day Japan where a boy named Yukiteru (our protaganist) is shown to be a solitary person. He keeps to himself and has almost no friends. He rather spends his time typing everything he sees into his diary.  His only friend is the imaginary god of space and time Deus Ex Machina who he talks to in his bedroom. One day Yukki sees his diary entris are already written down and everything that happens is written down in his cellphone.Yukki suspects Deus has something to do with this and it turns out Deus is not that imaginary. Deus forces Yuki to take part in a 12 man battle royale fight to the death. The diary of each participant now has the abilty to predict the future each with it's own benifits and weaknesses. The diary must be used by particiapants to kill each other with the winner being Deus' successor as god of space and time. You already have to be itching to see this if you have not already.I thought that it would be a lot like Death Note because of the concept te be a able to predict a future death but this show takes an old idea and makes it its own and Future Diary can even give Death Note a run for it's money. The writing for this series is razor sharp and the show never loses any steam during the 26 episode run. I have to admit that the show only really pulled me in with the second episode . The modern setting makes it accessible and watchable for a lot of people since a bunch of viewers don't like space westerns, period pieces or post apoctolyptic  shows. The show is full of twist and surprises. There is also a romantic subplot which a guy like me, who does not really care for romance enjoyed. Some people think that the ending was abrupt but I thought it was perfect. If you have a problem with it, read the manga or google the ending.\
STORY AND SETTING; 10/10\
ART:\
The art of this show is incredible. Each character has their own look with different facial expressions and details, their own outfits which really looks like something you can buy from any store. The backgrounds and landscapes  are clear, whether it is water or grass. The houses,cars and buildings look amazing,some would say this is just really bright live action objects. Just one example of how beautiful this show is is to look at the sunset. Jim Carrey could not have said it better : B-E-A-UTIFUL. There is some CGI in here which can turn off some viewers, but it actually grew on me. It is just one character and one environment so you don't have to worry if it's not your cup of Pepsi. One more thing, the cellphones, the diaries, it really looks like the animators put real effort into designs and layout.  One of the best art out there.\
ART 10/10\
SOUND:\
Another highlight if this show is the hypnotic sound. No voice is out of place, villian,good guy, fat lady, fat guy all whose voices fit like \"like a glove\"-Jim Carrey. The sound apart from the story to me is the make or break factor for an anime series. The voice actors convey incredible emotion with just a voice and they obtain what they set out to achieve. If the character should be rooted for, hated, likeable or felt sorry for,this is exactly what happens. Yukki can come off as annoying and whiney but it's all part of the way he matures throughout the series. The instrumentals played throughout the series makes you want to cry if something sad is playing when someone is dying or when something heroic plays you actually get goosebumps. My eyes were watering of excitement when something really badass happened. How good must the music be to make you feel like that. Really Motherloving good! The opening and ending theme songs of Future Diary are are catchy, upbeat, and just plain first-rate. The shows contains two opening songs and two ending songs with my personal favourites being the first ending theme and second opening theme both having a fast tempo and are really feel good songs. The first ending theme sounds like Japanese pop and the second opening is more of rock n roll but both are very good. The other two are not bad either.The first opening sounds like classical mixed with pop and the second ending theme falls more under soft rock. Incredible voice acting, songs that fit the tone of the show perfectly,this really is possibly the show's greatest asset.\
SOUND 10/10\
CHARACTER:\
I can't give this part a perfect score because there are like two contestants that you dont get to know as well as the other players and this agitated me because every other contestant gets their chance to shine. However every other character has  great character development with distinct personalities and qualities, there are even characters that are not part of the game that you begin to care for and learn to love. The main character Yukiteru, matures a lot through this show as I stated above. He is a unique main character, because he has his flaws. He doubts himself, and doesn't want to be god at the beginning of the story. He is not a fighter but bit by bit comes to terms with his situation and knows that he is a participant for a reason. Yuno who  is a smoking hot red head teen girl who has strong feelings for Yukiteru, is my favourite character on the show. She would do anything to protect Yukki, and is the most mysterious person in the game. Her actions ,her lack of mercy for other players , her abilities, she really  is a stand out character here.She plays major parts in the twists that occur,in the biginning, middle, end and everything inbetween of the series. Yuno is the the character that makes the story even more thrilling and epic than it already is. There are so many more characters but I'm really scared that if I summarise them it would take away the suspense and mind games that makes up this show.The other 10 contestants first appear as silhouttes when Deus first calls them together to explain the game so you don't know they are.Silouhettes + Mysterious characters=Guy biting nails. I'll just say there are killer and non-killers, lovers,terrorists,cops who all have their own reasons for wanting to be god. So with the exception of about two characters, everyone has a backstory. The non-contestant characters all three dimensional and are all believable. Friends or foes, all people that grab your attention. There is also a lot of moral abiguity because alliances can be formed and then be broken just like that. The acting of the characters, their facial expresions, everything is really good.\
CHARACTER 9/10\
ENJOYMENT:\
This was as I said my gateway anime. After I saw this I wanted to learn more about Japan. I want to do Judo,I want to learn Japanese,I want to create a cartoon show similar to anime, and I know who Steve Blum and Akira Kurosawa is. This is that good. Violence,suspense,twists,subtle humour, I love this show and after this I'm going to watch Great Teacher Onizuka and Full Metal Alchemist all thanks to this gem, this piece of art. I'm not overselling this series,it really is incredible and even though I'm a casual fan and have only seen a handful of anime, I recommend this to a person who is a fan of any genre of anime or even if you are not an anime fan and just want to watch a a spectacular tv show.And please don't forget to comment.\

    Okay. There is a lot to say about this anime. There's good, and there's bad. And then there's downright stupid. \
\
Story/Character:\
\
Okay, as you all know, the plot starts off pretty simply. People have Future Diaries. They have to kill each other. However, the plot turns really convoluted after a certain episode. \
I'm actually a big fan of yanderes. And to me, Yuno Gasai was the only thing about this series that was constantly good. She was a very well written character. And was very enjoyable. \
However, there are some really bad characters. Like how some characters were \"quirky\" but had no real personality to back\
          \
        it up. Most the characters come off as complete psychopaths at first, like Minene, and Reisuke. And others just lose it at random points throughout the series. And some characters are shown to be \"Good guys\" despite doing very horrible things. Again, like Minene and Yuno. \
One thing that you'll notice, is that the writer seems to really like Yuno. In fact, no matter what, she's /always/ right. ALWAYS. \
Until the end of the series where the writer decided they hated her and turned her into a complete monster. \
\
Some of the plot twists were laughable. And I hated more characters than I liked. Some characters had no personalities what so ever. And most the romance, besides Yukiteru and Yuno, were poorly executed. Meaning the characters met like twice, and decided they were in love. Except on one occasion, they met once.\
Art:\
And they art was pretty weird at times. I didn't care for some of the character designs. But overall, I liked it. \
Sound:\
The voice acting and theme songs were good. I liked most of the aspects of the sounds. \
Enjoyment: \
I did enjoy the series very much. I really liked it. I just didn't like the direction it took at the end. \
Overall:\
It's okay. Really, it's fun to watch. But overall, it's not great, not bad, just okay. \

    This is a quick, no spoiler review:\
I love this anime, It's a true masterpiece and it had great suspense, character building, plot, twists and bad ass action. The mix of action and strategy really brings the whole thing together for me.\
The only down side to this anime is the confusion towards the end, it does get very complicated and you really have to pay attention to get the gist.\
All in all, I would defiantly recommend this anime, It's one of my all time favourites and it would be a crime to not watch this. \

    I watched this show a few months back and its one of the things I most lowly rated on MAL so I will give my thoughts on Mirai Nikki. I watched this show after reading/watching the book/movie Battle Royale. So I was going into the show hoping to see people duke it out however the show is like a special sandwich. This special sandwich was made with all things in front of the person making the sandwich both good (actual food) and bad (pieces of metal, glass and fecal matter). The end result is something that is 10% edible and the other 90% makes you\
          \
        want to stop eating it however I ate the sandwich just so I can give a review of the whole show. \
Story 4/10\
The story is a cool concept, A battle to the death between 13 people who's mobile phones are their life force with the reward to the winner to become god.  Sounds like it would be good right however the problem with the story is the execution. The first episode was ok but everything to follow was a piping hot mess which fell more apart as the story progressed with the formation of plot holes and unnessesary plot armour with portions of the story not focused on the Battle Royale aspect. With weak characters as supports the story was lacking. \
Art 4/10\
The only good factor with the art was the backgrounds and setting drawn which where numourous and gave a sense of place. The first episode had some good art in the fights. Character designs where ok while stuff like gore was not too heavy. The cgi deus ex was kind of cool.  \
Sound 3/10\
opening sound was good but I am freaking tired of hearing \"Yuki,Yuki,Yuki\" every episode.\
Character 1/10\
This is where the show destroys its diapers. This has the most stupid MC I have ever scene in the world of fiction Yukiteru (I cant seriously think of anyone more useless, every other useless character in anime looks perfect compared to this guy). If you hate a character in a show because they are useless look at Yukiteru and think again. This guy is the very definition of baggage, whines, ruins every chance of character development and does incredibly stupid stuff that make you question his intelligence. \
If you are five episodes in thinking he will get better than how wrong you are. I was literally hoping he would get killed off by one of the other contestants who most of have a good reason for becoming god while this guy is getting a girl to fight for him instead of fight himself. Yuno gassai, I have no real problem (as I see them as the main villain rather than a heroin) with this character other than the fact that they spend the whole time protecting Yuki and their constant \"yuki, yuki, yuki\" chants. \
Other contestants I liked more than our MCs as I was rooting for them to win. Yukis freinds which are supporting characters are very plain except Aru who would be a better choice for MC then Yuki.\
Enjoyment 1/10\
After watching this show I would rather watch paint dry as that would be more enjoyable than watching some whiny kid win due to plot Armour. \
Overall 1/10  \

    *This Review Contains Spoilers*\
Mirai Nikki, aka The Future Diary, is one of most hyped and well received anime in 2011-2012. There are 2 ways to watch this show: if you turn of your brain and just watch it with a bag of popcorn, it'll be one of the best blood-shedding, twisted, and suspenseful anime you'll ever watch. However, if you actively turn on your brain and actively engage with the story, you'll find it highly disappointing and will probably frustrate you to the point that you cannot even bare with it anymore. Now, just because I gave it a high rating, doesn't mean that this\
          \
        anime is perfect. I gave it a high rating because I turned of my brain while watching it, so bare with me as I go through this disastrous 'masterpiece'.\
Story: 5\
If you're reading this, you'll probably know what's going on so I'll get straight to the point. It's concept is downright astounding. It's one of the best concept I've ever seen because it is not so hackneyed and it's highly intriguing as well. It is very interesting in a way that it is a battle royale to take over the throne of god using cell phones that can predict future. However, all of these potentials are crushed because of its poor execution and logical fallacies. The story brings out question that's directly related to the plot itself and forces you to make an assumption of how certain events happened. Its logical fallacies also prevent you from enjoying the show to its fullest extent. \
Characters: 6\
I'll break this up into 4 parts (\"SPOILERS\")\
Yukiteru: Probably the most controversial character in the show. First, he is the most humane character in the show and probably the most 'normal.' Second, he is one of the worst character in the show because he is just simply a wimp, but defies all human logic as far as human relationship can go. He forgives his friend who tried to turn him into a doggy food, forgives his girlfriend who locked him up in a dilapidated old building for more than a week, and forgives his father who killed his mother out of whim. Well, the fact that he is 14, and a loner could probably explain WHY he decided to do those illogical things but the fact that you have to make an assumption about that is a BIG no-no.\
Yuno: The pivot to the story. A crazy yandere who is obsessed with his boyfriend and shows little to no human emotion and empathy aside from that. I just one to point one thing out: the show made her a frickin villain in episode 22, as she lies to Yuki and makes him kill all of his friends who was trying to help him. If the show ended with Yuki defeating this crazy bitch and repenting over his messed up action, than it would've been more redeeming but no~Yuki continues to love her and decides to trust her, which is just an unilateral relationship to me.\
Minene: My favorite character. Her backstory actually makes sense and it fits well with the tone of this story. Everyone says that she's a tsundere, but she's actually a kuudere. She's actually one of the character that I felt sorry when she died, because she actually has some redeeming features. Also, I enjoyed her fan service quite a bit. But her role in episode 16 or sth was completely stupid and just killed her. \
\
Akise: The best fitting character to the story in terms of the tone and plot. He is the one who uncovers all the diary incident and the mystery behind Yuno in a clever, not so much logic defying way.\
Art: 7\
Art was nice, but there were nothing too special about it either.\
Sound: 8\
Superb openings and alright music throughout the show\
Enjoyment: 10\
Turn of your brain, and it'll be one of the best show you'll ever watch.\

    What a godawfully ugly show this is.  \
I’m referring not only to the art style, which falls somewhere between unappealing and downright eerie, but to the show’s gestalt.  Nearly all of the characters are unlikable, except on a surface level, whether it’s due to their designs, their personalities, their actions, or the ideas they represent.  The show’s themes, when not actually alarming, are unsatisfying and demoralizing.  I’ve seen many worse instances of the “deathmatch between total strangers” concept, but I’ve also seen quite a few better versions.  The show is needlessly cruel to no effect other than annoyance.  The\
          \
        tone changes drastically with little warning and a total dearth of self-awareness.  Mirai Nikki may prove to be an enjoyable experience, depending on your tastes, but it is not a good show by any stretch of the imagination.\
Mirai Nikki leaves a very bitter taste in my mouth.  It has an uncomfortable, gloomy pall cast over it that derives not so much from the inexorable deaths of all the characters as from the implication that humanity is ugly, edgy, and stupid.  Not that people are flawed or imperfect and we should learn how to grow and change and deal with our problems, but that everyone is simply terrible in some way – pathetic, maniacal, greedy, vitriolic, deceitful, you name it – and that nobody can be bothered to do anything about it.  Time and time again Mirai Nikki has the chance to address profound moral questions: “Can good people do bad things?”  “Can all wrongdoings be forgiven?”  “What actions are morally acceptable to take in order to save a life?”  “How do I interact with someone who is personable but holds repugnant beliefs?”  Mirai Nikki has so many opportunities to pull itself out of the wasting hole of despair it has situated itself in, but acts like such considerations don’t even exist in its universe.  \
The show is bafflingly arbitrary in what it considers a forgivable offense.  One character can kill and/or maim countless bystanders but still wind up cast as one of the “good guys,” while another can turn out to be not quite as selfless and fun-loving as we had been led to believe and suddenly make public enemy number one.  You might view this as a chance to explore the complexities of human nature, but see the above paragraph.  It seems like Mirai Nikki wants to shove all this violence, gore, and despair down our throats so we’ll be impressed by how dark and brutal the show is, but then doesn’t want to deal with the consequences of having to explain or explore those traits in meaningful ways.  If stacks and stacks of (very recent) past misdeeds fail to sway characters in their assessments of those around them and don’t really have much effect on how people interact with each other, there seems to be no point to assigning such gratuitous violence to the show’s backdrop in the first place.  This show stacks bodies behind its characters not to provoke any deep thought or change the environment of the show or tell us anything new about the characters themselves; the only thing we get is an excuse for more gore at no real cost to the relatability of the characters.  Let’s not bother digging into how none of the kids seem traumatized by the fact that their homeroom teacher was a serial killer.  That little detail is forgotten as soon as it no longer becomes an immediate danger.  In fact, the world at large seems to be utterly oblivious to the enormous body count stacking up around the diary holders, but addressing that would take too much time and effort.\
Mirai Nikki truly suffers in the character department.  Yukiteru might be the most pathetic loser of an anime protagonist I’ve ever seen, and I’m counting Shinji Ikari twice.  I never sympathized with him, but found him as thoroughly unlikable as main characters come.  Yuno is kind of fun, simply because she’s frighteningly insane and the show manages to convey this pretty darn well.  When the show wants Yuno to unnerve the audience, she really pulls out all the stops.  That only applies to her dark side, however; the show keeps trying to push her cute, endearing side, which somebody seems to think exists, and while she may ultimately qualify as pitiable, lovable she is not.  Most of the other faces we see over the course of the show are forgettable, generic, frustrating, obnoxious, or poorly thought-out.  “Redeeming qualities” are largely nonexistent everywhere you look.\
That’s not to say that none of the characters endeared themselves to me, because over the course of the show I did grow somewhat fond of a few folks here and there (and by that I basically mean Minene and Nishijima, though Ai and Marco were all right, too), but nonetheless I don’t think too highly of the portrayal or presentation of those characters a lot of the time.  Mirai Nikki likes to think that it has some kind of “power of love” narrative wrapped up with thrilling mysteries, compelling character studies, and commentary on the deepest qualities of human nature, but most of the time it just sloppily barrels into incompetent repugnance.  Contrivances and plot conveniences abound.  One of the characters is literally called Deus X Machina.  I don’t know that that is supposed to mean anything (because it sure doesn’t in the context of the story, except to plant that phrase in your mind for the next time you see something happen for no reason).\
There are moments throughout the show that evoke genuine pity and sorrow, strike tangible horror, and inspire warmth – but only moments.  More often than not, the players stumble over each other in webs of dubious motivations, inconsistent characterization, and some of the unhealthiest relationships you’ve ever seen committed to animation.  Yuno’s homicidal obsession has made her the calling card of Mirai Nikki, the most recognizable character belonging to the yandere archetype, and the detail that initially interested me in the show, but Yuno by no means bears the sole responsibility for Mirai Nikki’s depravity.  The ways in which she interacts with Yukiteru seem to shift depending on conveniences of storytelling rather than following from any sort of consistent developments in personalities, and the same could really be said for every character.  The characters don’t grow or learn, not truly – they just “are” things one minute or episode and “are” different things the next.\
How many shows have we seen where a supposed villain turns out to be a decent person or is pursuing the same goals as the protagonists and joins their side?  I love it when that happens, but usually that character goes through some kind of arc or has strong reasons behind their actions.  In Mirai Nikki, the process we see is, “Eh, I don’t really care that you killed a hundred people last episode and then tried to kill me and my loved ones.  We’re pals now [citation needed].”\
The premise itself never quite gets the treatment it deserves.  The diaries are often used cleverly, but just as often it seems as though opportunities for development fell by the wayside.  Forget about receiving any sort of clarification as to the nature of divinity and the universe; the details of the “prize” for winning the game aren’t fleshed out enough to seem real, and even if the show returns to that plot point often enough to make it a tangible part of the series, enough important questions remain that it, too, becomes tiresome to think about.  \
After enduring so many episodes of pointless slaughter, ridiculously unrealistic characters, and too many dumbass twists to count, I was unreasonably satisfied with the ending, which is far better than what the show deserves.  I won’t share any details, of course, but the ending of Mirai Nikki was so strong that it took me aback.  I reconsidered my whole opinion of the show for a little while, and I’m even convinced that the show up to that point needed to double down on the ugly, ruthless, gratuitous, crushing insanity in order to allow the ending to have a real impact, and it did.  I hold this to be true, but at the end of the day, I had to sit through far too many episodes of that crap for one strong finale to make up for the rest of the shows failings, even those that are invalidated by the story’s end.\
It is possible to do all the things that Mirai Nikki tries to do and be all the things that it tries to be, but Mirai Nikki does not succeed.  It’s just sort of ugly and bizarre and steeped in moral turpitude.  At least my poor opinion of Future Diary follows the weighing of many factors both positive and negative; the show isn’t a complete wash, and I certainly don’t regret watching it.  In fact, when my irritation clicked off for brief periods, I even enjoyed it, and I would definitely be willing to give it a second chance at some point in the future.  The OPs and EDs are all pretty great, the performances are generally solid, and the premise is interesting enough.  For now, though, I still consider Mirai Nikki overall edgy, stupid, unsettling, and ugly.",

    \"Mirai Nikki\" is a good anime that involves Timetravel, Action, Drama and Romance. By using these elements and a good (not great) main character it even makes up to be called psyhological too\
_________This review will contain small portions of spoilers (really small)_________\
But i believe that you will watch anime because of it's psyhological thinking, animation and actions scenes\
\
\
************************STORY*********************\
Well story is pretty much simple, Main protagonist owns a diary in which tells future and since he knows it he can change the future that can occure. Also (lol) he must kill others owners of diffrent types of diarys to become god, since THE god \"Deus\" have\
          \
        collected people who write diarys to a battle, in which one of 12 owners will survive. And become new god since he is dying fast. Pretty simple, huh. The most interesting effect is plot between Main protagonist and Second one. They both know that only one can survive and yet again. Somehow this plot manages to deliever interesting things by the end. In the middle plot is pretty much plain.\
8/10\
*******************ART & ANIMATION*****************\
By seeing many types of anime i can say that the Art is most interesting factor in it. The animators really stood out here by showing good viewing angle and then showing a really good art style. Simply \"ART is GOOD\"\
*cought* *cought* Animation is not bad either\
9/10\
********************Characters**********************\
By far the worst point is the characters Cliche and expected mostly they are enemies that Main characters have to face that have like stupid motivation of becoming the god.\
Another stupid factor is main character, he doesn't evolves and stays the same, always the weak bitch, not taking a matter in his own hands. His character only evolves by the end of the anime, at that time you will be probably saying ffs finally you understood.\
6/10\
*********************Sound************************\
Second most coolest factor in this anme is SOUND DAMN. From op to ending titles music is great. Music is pretty much depends on ur own standarts but damn it Rock and makes you think at positive vibe, ready to start watching this anime. \
The sounds are great from a crack,stack or explosion. They are really immersive.\
9/10\
********************Enjoyment*********************\
Like this one cause im probably a noob in anime but i only saw about 7-8 Action animes but in this one i didnt expected to be so psychologically thirre at the same time. I watched this anime in probably 9 days 2-4 episodes per day i really recommend you watching in that way cause they are somepoints when anime takes a large turn and for example a episode ends at epic fight next episode starts after it, in a piecefull an relaxing way possible.\
10/10\
*********************Overall*********************\
Love Psychological Action Romance and at the same time like to see main character be 14 year old ?\
Also like GOOD Well animated action ?\\nWatch it. I didn't expect to like it but it somehow drawn me in to watching it more and more.\

    A work with a lot of potential, but that was thrown in the trash by working a protagonist without charisma, deaths without purpose, a heroine who does things without meaning only to show how a yandere is (the fact of being mentally disturbed only shows how the author don't know how to work a character) and a climax that ends up leaving something to be desired.\

    For every positive, ten negatives\
Mirai Nikki is a show with a not so great first episode, but promises to get better. All it does is go downhill. \
The plot is about a survival game to decide who will become the next god. Twelve players participate and each one of then have a future diary.\
The problem with this is that the potential of the diaries to resolve problems or be used smartly to win battles is totally lost. Most situations where the main characters are in danger or faced with a challenge are resolve by luck or a convenience, or even worse, plain dumbness of the\
          \
        characters. \
All the plot holes and continuity mistakes don't help either. When they happen so frequently its difficult to ignore them, and most of them are really avoidable.  This is lazy from the writers.\
But the worst thing in the show by far are the characters. They are really inconsistent. They chance from good to villainous and vice versa in a blink, and the main protagonist has an incredible ability of forgiveness. A lot of the characters have a really dark past, this could have worked, but the stories are so exaggerated (for the shock) that are difficult to take serious. The most memorable character of the show is Yuno and for good reason. She is entertaining and have some awesome moments, but after the plot twist near the end all her previous actions lack sense. And about the ending, it becomes four episodes too long. The episode that leads to the plot twist is really boring, and after it happens the show that wasn't good, becomes really nonsense. That makes the last episodes really painful too watch.\
Not everything is negative, some action scenes are good, and it gets mildly entertaining at moments. The music of the show accompany well the action scenes. The animation is not bad but not good either. The art style is ordinary, making the show loose personality, and the character design fluctuates from really good to weird.\
Judging by its popularity and the great opening I was totally mislead to a really disappointing show.\

This anime grabs your attention on the first episode and then your journey begins into the world of Mirai Nikki. You start  to understand the story at the start but it can get confusing if you do not pay attention to every scene and do not take note of what all the characters say..but that's part of what I love about this Anime. It's story goes hectic at parts in a (good way) and you may lose what's going on if you're not careful so MAKE SURE YOU KEEP NOTE OF THE STORY!\

    So I just finished Mirai Nikki today, I was bored and searching for a good anime, and find Mirai Nikki. I already heard of this anime before, but doesn't know what it is about. So I looked about it, and turns out it's about a survival game and I like that kind of genre so I try watching it without looking at everyone reviews.\
( Spoiler ahead, and don't hate this is just my opinion )\
The first episode was okay, it's kinda like hunger games where there will only be 1 person who survive in the end. Hunger games was pretty cool so I thought Mirai\
          \
        Nikki will be good.\
Well it's not...... The story is about Yukiteru and Yuno be friend and then he hates her, and then he forgive her and then hates her again. REALLY?! Like can you not, the girl is psycho how can you be so stupid, okay I want to continue this review later.\
[ STORY ]  5\
Average for me, the plot was good but the end was bad in my opinion. Well except that everyone had a happy ending ( I meant people in the third world, people in the other world died so... ) I almost cried when I watch the ending, but the scene when Yukiteru is in the God's world? I don't know where he is, well he was looking at his phone and reading his diary, this scene made the ending disappointing, I mean just show that everyone is happy in the end and just end the anime already.\
[ ART ]  8\
I don't have anything to say, the art is good. So I'm giving it an 8.\
[ SOUND ]  6\
I don't like both opening lol, I don't hate it, it's just not good in my opinion. The ending was not bad tho.\
[ CHARACTER ]  8\
Okay where do I start..\
Amano Yukiteru\
I kinda hate him honestly. Especially the part where he shot Hinata, Akise and the others. Like what the hell dude, they were honest with you, BUT no you are just a selfish piece of shit who only believe in Yuno till the end. Other than that part he was okay lol.\
Yuno Gasai\
She's a psycho. I know.. her mother treat her bad and Yukiteru died in the first world, maybe it's too much for her. BUT seriously? she's creepy as hell. I don't get why Yukiteru still want to be near her after everything she has done. I don't think any guy want to be with a girl like her, I mean she's scary man. I don't hate her tho, she's just weird...\
Uryuu Minene\
One of my favorite definitely, my favorite girl character in Mirai Nikki. I don't really like her in her first apperance, but after that she was really dope! And a tsundere too lol makes her interesting, I really ship her with Nishijima lol, when she first met him I was like really excited. She's probably one of the reason I still continue watching this anime.\
Akise Aru\
My favorite character and THE ONLY reason why I watched Mirai Nikki till the end. First of all, c'mon how can you not like him? He's really cool and smart, and turns out to be a nice guy who's (gay?) lol I meant who wants to help his friend Yukiteru.\
[ ENJOYMENT ]  6\
I was just curious about the story, like who's the third body that Yuno killed and what's the ending gonna be like. Don't really enjoy the anime, although I REALLY enjoy Uryuu x Nishijima scene.\
[OVERALL ]  5\
Don't know.. I don't really like this anime, definitely not worth watching twice. Don't want to recommend people to watch it too. I don't hate it, it's just sucks.\
This is my first review, sorry if it sucks or made you mad if you think Mirai Nikki is good. Well people have different opinion and this is mine.\

    This anime is beautiful. The character development is amazing. As you watch Yuno and Yukki go through the story and beat the other diary holders, you can really feel what is happening. This anime just has it's way of touching the users heart, leaving a memory, and making you kind of freak out when something happens. As the story progresses, you learn more about the characters pasts and it really makes you think. The creators must have put a ton of thought into this anime because even though there is a ton of blood, murder, and gore, it actually has a purpose and isn't totally\

    If you have not seen this anime from the various memes pictures, then I commend you. When I first watched this anime, I did not know what I was getting myself into. This is a very psychological horror-esque  type of anime. There is action, gore, and a very unique type of romance. If you are looking for an anime that will take you into a unique story line and finally know where the yandere face comes from, watch this anime. The first opening of the anime completely pumps me up and sets the chaotic tone for the show. The pacing of the anime gets\

    Mirai Nikki is probably best known for its female lead Yuno Gasai, the prime example of a so called Yandere. But it also has an interesting premise: The God of Space & Time & Death is about to perish and wants to find a new god by giving 12 individuals the chance to use their cellphone diaries to look into the future and kill each other untill only one participant remains.\

The idea of the story is nothing new, we have seen something similar in Battle Royale and other works, but the future diaries give it a fresh touch. We get to see different versions of\
          \
        the device, their strengths and weaknesses and the cleverness (or lack thereof) of their owners. The story itself never falls flat and provides constant conflict and action (which often moves into splatter territory).\
9/10\
Art:\
The animation looked solid at first, but as the show continued, it provided quite a few awkward animations. I don't know why this happened, because in the beginning it all went down smoothly. The CGI effects blend in well and don't disrupt at all (and that's coming from somebody who dislikes CGI in general). In fact later on, they look even better than the classic animation.\
6/10\
Sound:\
The first opening was one of the best I've seen yet and really set the mood for what you are about to watch. Sadly it got replaced midway by a not so cool song that is sung in Engrish. The ending was okay, not good but not bad either. The soundtrack didn't really stick to me, but it was never a disturbance or distraction, so I'd say it's solid.\
6/10\
Characters:\
Now here's the major problem of Mirai Nikki. The male lead has to be one of the worst characters I've ever seen. Many people despise him for being a wuss and they are kinda right. Yukiteru in itself is annoying as hell, but the combination with Yuno, who keeps exploiting him, could have worked well. But after she went too far and Yukiteru even WANTS to completely avoid her, he keeps coming back for more. That isn't excusable with his weak character anymore, that's just going back to status quo for the sakel of it. As if that wasn't enough, he becomes a complete bastard (who is still a wuss) and Yunos character takes some hits too. While she started out as a great villain, she was more and more devillified as the story progressed, making this show lacking an actual antagonist. The only thing saving this show at all are the minor characters, which are a lot of fun. The other diary owners, Akise, Deus & Mur Mur kept me entertained when the main characters failed to do so.\
3/10\
Enjoyment:\
Overall, I'd say it was worth watching. I'm just glad I had no high expectations for this Anime, otherwise I would have probably dropped it. If you'd just exchange Yukiteru with somebody slightly interesting, Mirai Nikki would've made its way into my favourites. But as it stands now, it's just an average show with some highlights and some lowlights. Solid entertainment but by no means a future classic.\

        (currently only around my 20th watched) I would ALWAYS recommend this 1000% I cannot stress how much this anime is amazing. It has awesome action and mystery.. The romance is amazing and the feels are so good and bad (in a good way.. if that makes sense..) Just an overall amazing anime!! Yuno is the most amazing Yandere imo and I slowly fell in love with the character more and more with how I learnt about her. GASAI IS SENPAI \

    I don't normally write reviews in general but this anime left an impression on me. \
Mirai Nikki if had to sum it up is this: The Hunger Games that does not stop.\
The story is absolutely amazing and makes you sit back and think about it after you finish it. It is a pretty dark story so if you can't take blood or easily scared it might not be for you. It is about a group of people fighting to become a god and each of them has their reasons. You follow the main character who is probably the biggest wimp in a anime you have\
          \
        ever seen but that gives him a unique charm to the anime.\
The animation and usage of sound in this anime are superb. It really helps convey the feeling of the anime. I also really enjoyed the intro which is a first typically I would watch it once then skip it for the next ones i don't think there was a single time i did so. Almost all the characters are fully fleshed out. I only had an issue with one of them but there were so many that it was easy to overlook. \
I have to say it will probably be in my top 5 favorite anime for awhile. If you haven't seen it yet it is worth taking a weekend outta your life to sit down and eat popcorn and watch.\

    STORY\
The story in general is a tried-and-tested concept in texts such as BTOOOM! and The Hunger Games, but the twists and turns that are introduced in almost every episode keep things fresh and the viewer guessing. Fanservice is kept to a minimum as well, and what is there is both funny and fluid, barely interfering with the plot at all. Most characters are given a decent backstory and some character development, especially the main characters. For a twenty-six episode anime, the show's pacing is magnificent and the rate at which the story is unravelled is great. I'll admit, the ending did have some fairly ridiculous\
          \
        things, but the ending was wonderfully done, and sets up the epilogue, Mirai Nikki Redial, in a grand way.\
ART\
In general, the art is very good, with the blend of CG and standard 2D animation fitting very well with the series. There are some baffling uses of CG, however, with items such as Tsubaki's scroll and  most other diaries being 3D modelled sometimes and 2D images other times. Other than that, the art is exceptionally detailed and well-done, with character designs being some of the best and most intricate I've seen in quite a while. And then we have the striking opening and ending animations, which are nightmare fuel in every sense of the word. Cryptic, yet oh so perfectly decodable; the perfect way to do it.\
SOUND\
Can't have a thriller series without spooky ambiance! The music and ambient sounds are a marvel, and really shock the viewer. They add to the striking visuals in a near-perfect way, and set up for even greater things. The two openings are both fantastic as well. Opening 1, Kuusou Mesorogiwi, is very upbeat and punk in style, but suits the overall tone of the show in its mystique and flowing rhythm. Dead END, on the other hand, is very bass-heavy and dark. It is one of the few anime openings I've seen that's completely in English, and it just fits the song perfectly.\
CHARACTER\
Ah, the characters. Funnily enough, this is perhaps the weakest link in the show. First of all, we have Yuki, who is weak, a crybaby and very scared of everything. He's not a bad character. If you were in his shoes, you'd be on the floor sobbing as well. However, he seems to not realise that he needs to change until later in the series, where he snaps and becomes trying extremely hard to win despite his own morality. It's a hard situation to be placed in, but Yuki pulls it off well... too well. I actually believe that Yukiteru is inhuman, not in his inability to adapt, but in his adapting extremely well for a small period before snapping back to scaredy-cat mode. Yuno, on the other hand, is very protective of Yuki. She is labelled as a yandere due to her actions, and I don't disagree. Bitch is psycho. Combined with her superhuman durability and reflexes, as well as exceptional knowledge of human anatomy, she's on the other end of the spectrum. She's a non-relatable character because of her mindset. You don't know anybody like Yuno, because you're still alive. Strangely, the character I find most human and relatable is Minene Uryuu, the Ninth Diary Holder. Her actions are all fuelled by her own passion and mind. She knows how to survive on her own, and acts as an anti-heroic mentor to Yuki after an encounter as a major antagonist. Minene's character arc is very similar to Vegeta from Dragon Ball Z in a way. Starting off as a villain before becoming a lovable anti-hero with some anger issues, Minene eventually makes an ultimately fruitless sacrifice to try and save the day. This could be considered a cliche character at this point, but Minene pulls it off so well, I can't care. Most of the other characters are either comic relief (Kousaka, Hinata, Mao) or deep characters (Fourth, Aru, Tenth) who would simply take up a lot of space in the review, but all of them have significant and important impacts on the story and characters. Except Third. He's kinda just there. I don't know why.\
ENJOYMENT\
I had a lot of fun watching this anime, and I'm planning on watching the dub to compare in a while. Its rewatch value is high due to the amount of things that can be missed (and probably will the first time around), however, after watching a few psychological thrillers in the past, I've been able to train myself to pay attention to all the details. If you've never seen a psychological show before, you should at least know what to look for and what to appreciate before diving into Mirai Nikki. A lot of the show may go over your head if you have no idea what a psych show is aiming to achieve. If you have seen a good thriller series before, this show will take you on a ride that ends in a fantastic climax that honestly nearly brought me to tears when I first watched it. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Mirai Nikki.\
CONCLUSION\
After watching this show all the way through, I can fully appreciate Sakae Esuno's work with this series. It hits rather hard with a clever, exciting story and a climactic destination. The anime has firmly cemented itself at the top of my list of favourite anime of all time, and could perhaps be my favourite work of fiction ever. For a thrilling experience that will keep surprising you until the end, I recommend Mirai Nikki, but be warned; it's not for the faint of heart.\

    This anime has inspired me in so many different ways.\
The artwork was amazing! I honestly loved the color contrast of their eyes and the well-balanced body proportions! :)\
The story has a very Hunger-Games feel to it since it's a \"kill or be killed\" plot line. Basically, as you can see from the description, it's a bunch of people who are killing each other to become \"God\". All of this may seem pretty cliche but the thing that really caught my eye was the use of future-telling phones and the character structure.\
First off, the future-telling objects was a very creative idea. We probably had thought up\
          \
        this device as kids while we were playing \"pretend\" and stuff. It was pretty neat seeing your \"dream weapon\" come to life in anime :D The concept of them was PHENOMENAL! How they set it up in a diary form which reflects the player's character in some way or another was a very neat touch that I adored ^-^\
Secondly the characters were very well-made! They all had a reason of wanting to become God, not just because of the heck of it. Even though they may seem pretty annoying and dou*chy at first glance, they all have a pretty well-explained backstory to explain their actions which makes you fall in love with them <3 Finally! I found an anime with no 3-dimensional  antagonists!\
Now we have the cons...\
BEWARE OF THE UNCENSOREDNESS\
they will show lots of...erhmm \"graphic\" images that are completely irrelevant to the plot. For an example, showing boob nipples, showing actual penises, etc. Yes, they do not censored them, and it takes the viewer's attention away from the actual story and onto the...ehghh \"detail\"\
At the ending it started becoming more thrown together and not very well thought out. Only adding sexual scenes in just to make it \"interesting.\" Again, VERY irrelevant to the plot.\
Overall, I do recommend this anime to people who love a neat mix of Sci-Fi, fantasy, and romance :D\
**Note to Dub and Sub viewers***\
I personally, watched the dub version of it and it was pretty okay ;) lots of people said it's one of the worst dubbed animes but since I'm so used to dub, it wasn't THAT bad. But I only recommend the dub to people who are used to watching dub.\
As for sub-people.. stick with sub. The sub is AMAZINNGGGG. I watched a few clips of the sub and it was *gives OK hand sign*\

    You know that feeling you get when you're stuck on the hardest maths problem at the end of your exam? Or the feeling you get when you're playing chess and all of a sudden the opponent has cornered you in a check? It's that feeling of \"Oh crap, well now I'm stuck, how do I get out of this one?!\"... well, that's the feeling I get in every single episode of Mirai Nikki, seeing a *DEAD END* prediction of the future and praying that the protagonists know a way out of it.\
Story: 10/10\
Let's start with the story, I think that's kind of what won me\
          \
        over for this series. The basic idea is that 12 players are given future diaries, which are used as tools to fight each other for the position of the next God. Yes, it reminds me of a cross between Hunger Games (the book) and Death Note (the anime, and you should watch if you liked Mirai Nikki!)... but that's just the type of plot that makes the anime so exciting to watch because the characters are constantly in life-threatening situations, and they don't always have time to think of the most strategic way to get out of it. On top of that, there are all these character relationships (like alliances between enemy groups) that makes you constantly wonder who will suffer betrayal first. It is kind of evident that Yukki and Yuno would be the last two in the game and that there would be some kind of awkward showdown (I mean, look at the cover photo of the anime lol), but the twists and turns along the way are not always expected, and each little secret you discover helps you to unravel the mystery behind the whole story and goes to explain why Yuno is the way she is.\
Character: 8/10\
The characters themselves really dramatise the anime to the next level. The character everyone can most relate to is Yukki, the poor little lamb! He is simply an everyday 14-year-old observer who keeps to himself and writes random things in a personal diary on his phone, and yet, because of this, he is chosen to be part of this crazy game. He starts off as completely helpless, and constantly needs others (especially Yuno) to help him survive in the game. Sometimes it can be annoying, because you would think the protagonist boy should be a bit stronger than that. But he is the most realistic character in there, I mean, I would have reacted the same way, a bit dazed and reliant, if I was just thrust into a survival game. Plus, towards the end he really starts to discover the strength in himself, and you see him grow out of his shell little by little as the anime progresses. \
The second most important person to talk about is Yuno: a psychotic girl who constantly obsesses over Yukki. It's hard to understand Yuno, mainly because her character purely exists to \"protect Yukki\". But you get to see some insights and reasons behind her dark side as the anime progresses, and what you find towards the end is quite a surprise. \
Then we have all the players in the game, who all have different pasts,  different personalities and, of course, different future-prediction devices. This is what really makes the anime like a bit of a roller-coaster ride, the characters work together and against each other to find each others' weakness in order to win, and you discover something new in every episode that makes you go \"aha!! so that's how it is...\"\
Art: 9/10\
I liked the art overall, the violence was well depicted without being over-dramatic or cheesy. The character expressions also worked well with the emotions of the story.\
Sound: 7/10\
I guess I didn't notice this much, but I suppose it would have worked since I didn't notice much of a discrepancy between the animation and the music.\
Overall Enjoyment: 10/10\
Maybe I'm just a sucker for strategic-mystery-romance anime, but this one was really addictive. Mirai Nikki just has the right amount of suspense and action, without losing out on the character relationships. Yes there may be a glitch here and there in the plot (especially in the last few episodes), but the crazy journey that you go through with Yukki, fighting to survive this game, draws you in very easily!    \

Art: The Art Was really fantastic. best ones was of the buildings & inside buildings  most of the characters Was really good like Yuno Gasai. Minene Uryu, Aru Akise. Tsubaki Kasugano, Reisuke Houjou \
The worst ones i have to say where couple of the main characters i think they could of work on them alittle bit more than they did The following Characters that i think are the worst drawn the the anime\
Kamado Ueshita\
Deus Ex Machina\
Muru Muru\
    &\
Yukiteru Amano I think hes Clothing was really not that great but also hes face expressions want me to kick him in the balls he wasn't that great for the main character i think he should of been worked on more.\
Sound:The music & the sounds really mix in with the story & the time there's not much to say about it but the Sound/Music was great \
Enjoyment: I've enjoyed every minute of Mirai Nikki It has to be one of my favorite anime The whole thing is just great and i think its worth to be one of the best anime out there i would recommend everyone to watch it.\
Overall: Overall the anime is the best I've watched it twice and the re watch value is great even if you seen it you can still enjoy it really perfect anime too bad that its so short i think they should of extended it to another season\

    An anime like \"Mirai Nikki\" or \"Future Diary\" is unique in its own way. The basic plot was scary in itself! Twelve geniuses, masterminds, terrorists, and murders all thrown together to try to kill each other to become God while using future devices to help them? Does that sound frightening yet brilliant or what! Some people have mentioned its likeliness to \"The Hunger Games\", but this anime is so much more complex. The back stories of these characters draw the watcher in to learn more for their own reasons for wanting to become a God. This soundtrack is one of the creepiest soundtracks.\
I've heard in\
          \
        an anime which is of course a good thing! The main characters, Yukki and Yuno, are really an odd pair that share a disturbing romance that brings so many plot twists! *shudders* Overall, this anime is a roller coaster that seems to never end so I recommend this twisted anime to slightly more mature audiences.  \

    Mirai Nikki in a nutshell is The Hunger Games with cell phones… Well that's not all what Mirai Nikki is. It is also a love story covered with blood, violence, and disturbing images.\
Story- Deus Ex Machina the god of this world is dying and needs to find a successor, so he creates a survival game to determine his heir by using 12 future diaries that go hand in hand with the users personality. The game is a battle of outsmarting the other diary users by murdering them or destroying their future diaries. The show also likes to throw in plot twist and the biggest plot\
          \
        twist will have you really interested in this show.\
Sound- The music in Mirai Nikki is great when setting the tones of each scene perfectly. Also that first opening theme song is probably the one of the best opening themes in any anime\
Characters- Yukiteru Amano is the main male protagonist and if I were to give him a character rating  on a scale of A+ to F I would give him a B-. Sometimes he mediocre and sometimes he's good. Yuno Gasai is the main female protagonist and is the crazy stalker girlfriend of Yukiteru Amano. Also the Queen of Yandare. She is without a doubt one of my favorite female character from an anime. My grade for her is an A+. She is just a great character. The other characters in this show are good supporting characters with disturbed and tortured past and they all are likable characters.\
Enjoyment- I had a blast watching this show from start to finish. The creepy scenes in this show were in fact disturbing, but the best scenes are when Yuno goes berserk that alone is why this show is entertaining.\
*Also in this anime there are omakes at the end of each episode some important to the plot, but it's mostly for comedic relief. F.Y.I. the omake in the last episode is very important to watch.\

    It's been a while since I've wrote one of these, so I thought I'd come back with a show that I generally enjoyed.\
First, I'll start off with the story. To avoid a long winded summary, basically, 12 people are given a power to predict a future (each power is different than the other) in the form of a diary. These 12 people were given this power by the god of time who is on his way out. God concocts this \"game\" to determine his successor, which will only happen when when one diary-holder is left. The premise and concept is very clever. It takes a\
          \
        classic concept like Agatha Christie's \"And Then There Were None\" of elimination through death and gives it a 21st century twist. However, the story isn't as straightforward as that. There are many twists and turns that keep you guessing. While it has slasher flick elements, it takes more of an appearance of a mystery. By the end of the anime the story comes full circle. It is a very well-written anime and they do very well not to leave any holes in the story. Even things that appear to be story holes throughout the anime are generally answered in the end. (10)\
The Art is solid. It does not have the best animation I've ever seen, but it is well above average. The character designs are near perfect and fit their character types well. For example, Yukiteru is drawn as a short boy always wearing layered clothing and a wool cap, almost as if he is trying to hide from the world. Likewise, Yuno is drawn very cute and adorable, as to try and capture Yukiteru's attention. There is quite a lot of Yuno fanservice, so be prepared for that. The chamber of Deus, the God, is very well drawn and the color is very fitting for a \"decaying\" god. It seems appropriate to mention the \"gory\" elements in this section. Caution: there is a lot of blood and body-mangling in this show. However, as someone who thoroughly enjoys Hellsing Ultimate, the gore in this show is rather tame. (9)\
In terms of sound, I break it down to both music and voice acting. For music, the openings and ending are very good. The first opening has an operatic tone to it which fits the serious premise, as well as a pop-rock feel to it as well. The second opening makes much more sense as the show goes on and the lyrics fit so perfectly. The second opening is also entirely in English as well. The voice acting is very well done, and the voices fit the characters quite well. My only complaint is that Yuno's voice gets a tad annoying at times. (9)\
I have trouble writing about character because it's hard to avoid spoilers for me. In addition, Mirai Nikki has so many characters in this show that it is hard to really describe them all. The main protagonist, Yukiteru is someone who prefers to be invisible and lacks self-confidence. I found myself really wanting to hit him for how pathetic he seems. I mean, really, man up dude. However, he, just like all the other long-running characters, encounters a lot of character development, most of it unexpected. I found myself really enjoying the character development of Uryuu Minene the most. It is my sincerest opinion that the characters are what make this show so enjoyable. While I find the story and premise interesting, it lacks substance without solid characters to build on it. The writers did a great job not only creating good characters, but making all of them enjoyable in some way, shape, or form (except for Murmur...couldn't stand her). Each character has a dark backstory that you can really relate to, and whether they be friend or foe, you really want to root for them and you hate the show for eliminating them. (10)\
Many people who I've recommended this show to were averse to watching it because of the blood, or killing, or whatever. It really isn't anything that you should avoid. The basic fact is that this show is really enjoyable. It is a roller coaster ride that keeps you guessing. Just a note of bad, for me, there are two episodes that don't really seem to fit and add nothing to the plot (13 & 14). They really have no importance to the outcome of the show's ending and seemed like they were just thrown in. Just bear with them as they are still enjoyable. For any anime fan, there's plenty for everyone in this show. I thoroughly recommend you give this show a try. (10)\

This anime leads you on and on wanting to go to the next episode without wanting to stop. It's action packed, suspension, and supernatural. A survival game with diaries that tell your future.

    Mirai Nikki a thriller/action/supernatural/psychological anime. I must say that it was a pain to wait a damn week for the final episode. Good story, good characters, what else can you ask for? It has pretty much everything, even though I'm not a fan I feel that I must say that you will find: some yaoi, yuri and rape scenes in this anime.\
  Story: Fairly good but  not the best,the story doesn't get boring, it always gets twisted in some way just to keep you right there, in front of the monitor/tv.\
If you don't get absorbed in by the main female character (which is\
          \
        quite easy) it's kind of impossible to not notice the plot holes! Quite a few plot holes... which I hate. I do believe that towards the end they twisted everything just a little too much, too much supernatural shit going on, and a few wtf moments too.\

  Art: Fairly good action scenes, seen better. Character design could've been better, I understand that it's also shounen but Murmur and 8th... that character design just doesn't fit in the anime at all. Yuuki  wearing a jacket+winter boots+cap but with mother fukin shorts, wtf?\
 That big ribbon on Yunno's uniform, meh I guess that I'm simply not a sucker for those things.\
 Art: 7/10\
  Sound: well this is always awkward to rate, nothing special, I guess that it's ok. Op/Ed could've been better.\
 Sound: 9/10\
  Characters: I won't talk much about the main male character, just the typical (bullshit) shounen anime male character you can call him pussy/pansy/whatever fits him I guess.\
  The main female character on the other hand: AMAZING! I never thought that I will ever see such an incredibly mentally disturbed character as a MAIN character.\
After the first few episodes I must admit she was the one thing that actually made me watch more of this anime. Just imagine the anime without Yuuno, it would be blunt and it would have nothing special. You could call her the only MAIN character since she is the one that keeps the plot going somewhere!\
But let's not only talk only about Yuuno, almost every character in this anime has an interesting personality, and of course an interesting back story (except Deus/Murmur/The mayor/and a few more). The interactions between them, the choices they must make because of the shit that's going on. They simply feel like real characters, which is rare nowadays.\
 Characters: 9/10 because of that pansy.\
  Enjoyment: I must say that I really did enjoy this anime, it was wicked, it kept me wanting more more more and more! I really can't wait for that \"new project\"!\
 Enjoyment: 10/10\
  Overall: I really loved the anime, even if it had many wtf moments, all in all Yuuno simply made up for everything. And let's not forget about Murmur sensei's backstage future diary: I see it as a bonus, it wasn't anything special but it really made me laugh at times.\
 Overall: 9/10\

    I really think that this anime should be more popular. It's story is definitely one of a kind. I have seen a LOT of anime throughout my life, and unlike most others, I have to say that this plot is the only one out there. It never ceases to surprise me and I'm always eager to find out what happens next. \
The art is not the type that I am used to, however after a few episodes I fell in love with the quality and art of this anime. \
The sound is nice and clear. Each character's voice portrays each and every character perfectly. \
Character,\
          \
        FTW!!!, I believe the personality and attitude of each character in Mirrai Nikki is illustrated wonderfully. Yuno's obbsession over Yuuki and Yuuki's cowardness. I love all the characters in this anime.\
Overall, I rate this a 10/10 if I could, I would rate it 1,000,000 out of 10. It's truly a masterpiece. I recommend it.\

    Just Finished the anime and hell I'm gonna make a review about it. I'll use my SPAMCALL method again. Hope u guys read this since I'm gonna tell facts about the series.\
S-tory 9/10\
A really interesting series, with a great plot. Its about 12 people with supernatural diaries with different types of power that battles to become God. They are forced to take the game since they have the potential. The anime simply copied almost everything in the manga, but there are a few noticeable changes like when Akise, Mao and Kosaka were in the cell that was supposed to be filled with cement, but in\
          \
        the anime they changed it to bad smoking gas, maybe to avoid horror for viewers. The part when Muru muru in the last of an episode was a great thing to do, having fun with her and stuff, just like in ep 25 about hearing Yuno's mom asking for advice, but it was just about hearing her problems. Yukiteru and Yuno kisses a lot of times that I love pretty much, unlike in Karate Kid when Black kid kissed young chinese and they haven't even reached 13 yet. The series has dark stuff like Killing, Sex Toy, Raping, Betrayal and other stuff which is my interest. So Basically the story has an originality on its own and follows logic especially about time leap.\
P-acing 6/10\
Just too fast, Really fast in each episode about 2-3 chapters of about 39 pages each were in one episode. The anime could have been much longer, maybe about 35 episodes? Who knows, but the series is just rushed. The ending even had a cliff hanger and shows a \"live drama\"? We foreigners might not even able to watch that. Fighting scenes are quite fast, in a good way. \
A-nimation/Art 8/10\
Openings and Endings seem to have low budget, but fighting scenes are really great, they give a refreshing way even though its just short. Another annoying thing about the Art is the darn Censorship of every cut offed body parts and stabbing of children. Quite short since this is Art.\
M-usic/Sound 8/10\
All songs are really great, DEAD END, Blood Teller, and others are great! Really great songs by Faylan and Yousei Teikoku. The sound effects about each date and each places shown with a \"ting, ting, ting\" are really ear-catching. And also the change of the future in a diary, sounds like a malfunction. Dark sounds are also great. The only thing about this part that I do not like is the voicing of each characters in the start of the series, mostly for Yukiteru and Yuno, its quite understandable since the seiyus are just beginners. Yuki being gay doesn't really sound that gay, it sounds more like a kid trying so hard to act gay, and for Yuno, Tomosa tries so hard to make her sound more adorable, but it ends up being creepy, which is mostly the target. But as the story progress Tomosa and Misuzu improves as Yuki and Yuno becomes more compatible with the voice.\
C-haracter 7/10\
Fucking Yuki is a kid undergoing puberty as he tries to run away from everything much like Shu from Guilty Crown, but Amano is worse. Almost everyone hates Yukiteru (even me) but as the story goes on he becomes more \"courageous\" as they say =.=, since he was able to say to Yuno her feelings. Yuno on the other hand is a character everyone likes even at the start of the series, she is really a likable Yandere character we hate it when she always clings to Yuki and not to us (ahaha!). She kills everyone for her satisfaction and Yuki's satisfaction as well. Other characters such as Muru Muru, Akise, Mineme, and Deus plays important roles that is pretty much anticipated by us, Akise is the gay detective who finds out almost everything, Deus is the god who is finding a person to replace him, Muru Muru is someone who clings to the main God and follows him/her until the end, and Uryuu is my second favorite that gets an important role in helping save the future and also has flying babies!!! :D They all progress as dynamic characters at the end of the series. While characters like 3rd who dies early, 4th who wants to save his son, 5th who got stabbed uncensored, 6th who was used as a sex toy, 7th who were a couple loving each other and the girl got raped in the past, 8th who was fat that one of the last, 10th who was killed by 4th, 11th who made the city in his control and 12th who was acting hero were characters that are not really dynamic but has each roles that we could like and their future changes in the third world. Some characters like Kosaka and the others are also influencial, so each characters are all useful in a way.\
ALL- in all 4/5 or 8/10\
The series is really great for a person who has not read the manga that they would pick the series as their best anime for Fall/Autumn 2011. Its true that it is great, but there has been some weeks that this series was not available and then finished quite late, (April 15?16?) And the cliff hanger of an ending made me say \"WTF!!?\" and I learned that it was going to have a drama maybe a sequel of the anime. I am pretty sure people who says this review is not helpful are people that are die hard Mirai Nikki Fan-boys/girls and wants this series to have at least 9/10 or 10/10 or maybe they would not like this review since they have a different view about it and enjoys it the most. Sorry to break it up to those people, but these are actual facts. I did not put much enjoyment of mine, since this review is just about facts on it. So I at least hope u enjoyed this review.\

    Mirai Nikki was definitely one of the most... interesting series I have ever seen. \
What would you do if you were to partipcipate in an all-out Battle Royale? If you were ordered to kill to achieve ultimate victory? Many books and manga have dealt with this: the phsycology of the characters, their actions, choices. In such a scenario, humans forget all they have learnt in society and rely on animal-like inscincts for survival. I am sure you have heard of the Lord of the Flies by Golding or Battle Royale by Takami Koshun (if you haven't check them out). These are perhaps the two most\
          \
        famous books that deal with diruptions of order and maintaining sanity.\
The premise of Mirai Nikki is something similar too. We meet a shy, timid main character called Amano Yukiteru, who doesn't really have friends and refers to lie in the shadows. He is thrust into a world of muder and power games by his imaginary 'friend' Deus Ex Machina, who gives each contestant a special power with which one way or another they are able to witness the future. Each diary gives the owner strenghs and weaknesses.  Naturally, there are some who do not wish to kill. Some who use their diaries for either good or bad actions. And like this, the battle begins.\
The story is divided into what can be considered arcs, in which Yukiteru and Yuno (I'll talk about her at the Characters part) encounter diary owners and face them, some on purpose, some by coincidence.These parts of the anime are what make it truly a thriller, as we see dark twistes and turns, secrets unfolding, and something that can be callad a jigsaw puzzle unfolds. A mystery about the diary owners' identity, about Yuno's identity. And this is the problem.\
The series has 26 episodes, and by the end of the 23rd and 24th, you will be biting your nails anxiously as you watch the curtain drop and see everything... explained. But somehow, the add a twist. Something you had no idea was coming and catches you totally off-guard. But it is exactly this climax that left me confused at the end. In other words, the ending could have been better. But when I think back, I remember the rest of the show, the cliff-hangers towards the end of most episodes, the dark elements. And those are what make the plot memorable.\
Art and sound are definitely high points of this anime. Each opening is awesome and complements the dark undertones of the story well. The first one is definitely my favorite opening, and apart from the actualy music the visuals are also outstanding: they use only shades of gray and red, and make it memorable. The endings weren't that special, though. Anyway, the inserted  pieces of music were awesome too and helpe to create a memorable mood.\
So while the soundtrack is definitely a high point of the anime, the art isn't always great. At the beginning especially the motions of the characters can be a little unfluid, and the minor characters aren't drawn in great detail. But toward the end, they do work on that, and the last few episodes are definitely outstanding when it comes to visuals. So all in all art and sound do a good job in complementing the story, and there even are some highly outstanding points.\
The part that left me puzzled in doubt are the characters. Yukiteru is our main character and who we are (supposed to be) cheering for. So basically he is 14 when the bloodbath starts, and he is quite a wimp in the first few episode, and I often felt an urge to scream at my laptop telling him to man up already. What the sudios decided what that they would make Yukiteru the misunderstood, always suffering character, who is constantly tormented between right and wrong, and they overdid this ridiculously.  At the beginning he is like all the crybabies you can see in other animes who are afraid of their own strengh. However in this particular anime, Yuki does not have any strengh. In the first 10 episodes or so whenever he encounters a diary owner and needs to fight for himself, he breaks down in tears and relies on Yuno to save his ass. I mean, yes this whole Battle Royale comes a shock to him just as I am sure in would to anyone of us, but come on!!! At times, the anime creators exaggarate, like, a lot. But the does what I call flip. Basically from that moment on while he remains physically weak he at least has a few moments where he become more of a strategy-creator persone while he leaves Yuno to do the dirty work (killing people).\
Which leads me to Yuno. I'll admit, if it hadn't had been for her, I would have either droppend the series or only watched if I would have been seriously bored. Anyway, she is by far the most intruiging and interesting person, and has a personality you don't really see in other anime. With her diary she can see Yukiteru's actions 10 minutes in advance, and becomes his stalker. Yukiteru accepts her help and they join forces, but basically ends up using Yuno. But she is not a wimp by any standard. She is a badass when it comes to fighting, and ends up protecting Yukiteru. \
Their chemistry is intriguing and is one of the main highlights of the series. Yukiteru is a shy caharcter especially at the beginnign, but while Yuno can be sweet sometimes, she also has a side that is ready to kill any girl who lays her sight on Yukiteru for too long. You'll see. I guess you can call this emotional unstability, and is in un indirect way caused by this Battle Royale. Also, her identity, home etc. are a huge mystery throughout the series, btu I don't want to say and spoilers:) \
The other diary holders are all interesting in their own way. They have their distinct personalities and diaries, which add a twist as they all either see the fuiture one way or another or have the ability to influence others. From Uryuu Minene through Katsugano (?) Tsubaki to John Bacchus, they all have their own stories to tell, and their reasons for desiring, sometimes in and indirect way, to become Deus Ex Machina's next successor and thus God. Their personalities are defined by roman/greek gods, and therefore the story is full of symbolism. Whether we look at Kuruso Keigo, who symolizes Hermes/Mercury the god of merchants, messages, thiefs, trading etc, or and obvious example, Yuno (or Hera) as the constantly jealous yet very powerful wife of Jupiter. (you can actually hera all these in the first OP).\
So while overall this anime definitely has it's faults, I enjoyed it nearly all the way. If you decide to watch this, don't expect a masterpiece or you will be left disappointed. But do prepare to enjoy yourslelf. And for your own safety, watch this with the lights on.",

       Mirai Nikki is a \"death game\" thriller that had a lot of potential. The show itself was like a sinusoidal curve with my interest in it. At the beginning my interested steadily rose, until dropping off until around eps 18ish, then dropping off after episode 22. \
   The story, without going into spoilers, was your average \"kill everyone until you're the last one standing\" hunger games approach to select the next god. It focuses on our MCs and their interactions with a certain number of enemies at a time, then moving on to the next batch. It seems repetitive and\
          \
        predictable, but I can honestly say that the ending few episodes weren't what I thought was going to happen. 7/10 for a pretty good thriller ride\
   The animation and sound departments were unremarkable. 6/10 each because they're good, but I didn't want to listen to the OST afterwards, and I didn't really see anything unique about the art. Some censoring early on is a nuisance, however, and the character models aren't half bad.\
   The characters are where this anime shines...blackness upon its overall score. They're shit; the MCs Yuuko and Yuno that is. I contemplated dropping this series because of the bad MC, but stuck through it because of the other characters being average. Yuuko may be the only relate-able character, but that doesn't make him an interesting character. 4/10\
   I enjoyed most of this series, maybe not the ending or some mini-arcs, but overall 5/10 for the somewhat fun watch.\
   Everything together, I scored this a 5.6/10, interesting premise, above average everything else, just shit characters that hold it back. \

Do you like a action, blood, romance and a game-a-like anime? Then this is a totally amazing anime for you!\
The plot (in my own words) :\
The plot of this anime is going about a boy, who is actually a\
          \
        loner, named as Amano Yukiteru.\
And Amano Yukiteru is writing in his diary on his mobile in the class.\
But one day Amano diary changes if he doesn't do what is told on the diary...\
He is participating the game, Mirai Nikki (Future Diary), with 11 other people, who has the ability to use their Mirai Nikki to kill the other 11 people.\
Each diary has its own special advantages and its disadvantages.\
The point of this game is to become the new God, because Deus Ex Machina's life span is going to end.\
And throughtout the anime, Amano is making allies and enemies...\
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
Story : 10/10\
I did really love the story of this anime, it's just a absolute banger!\
What I really like about the story is that the moments in the anime just could rollover in seconds.\
A example: once there is a moment that everything is fine, but seconds later everyone is in trouble.\
So I really liked the unexpected moments, the romance and the fighting of course!\
Art : 9/10\
The art of this anime is very good, but I've seen better art in another anime.\
The characters are overall well made with art, and the fightings are also good well made with art.\
Sound : 10/10\
To be honest, the first intro of Mirai Nikki is my favorite anime song ever, it's a kind of rock music and that fits perfectly for this anime!\
And when there are some action moments, I really like the background music then!\
Character : 10/10\
The best thing of this anime is (for me) how the characters are!\
Amano is a boy who isn't that heroic, he is more a scared boy who needs help of other people.\
And Yuno is a girl who protects Amano for everything, no matter what costs!\
And there are more characters who are that cool!\
Enjoyment : 10/10\
I really, really, really, REALLY enjoyed this anime!\
If you look at my MAL profile, you will see that this is my favorite anime now!\
And I liked this anime the most, because of the story and the characters in this anime!\
If I didn't had school these days when I was watching this anime, than I would watched this anime in ONE go!\
Overall : 10/10\
Mirai Nikki is for me one of the most beautiful, coolest and the best anime I've ever seen!\
And if I may say, Yuno is the most strangest character I've ever seen in a anime, but it is one of the best characters in this anime!\
Watching this anime was it really worth!\
I hope you liked my review and thanks for reading it!\

    There can be one or two psychos in a show but in this series there is not one who is sane...the charaters are poor, plot is interesting  but story is very poor and characters as i mentioned before are all insane, they are arbitrarily too good at somethings and everyone is good at one thing which is providing the plot with pointless twists. The characters are just immposible and difficult to connect to or imagine. You'll run out of imagination trying imagine how far they can they really can be pointless.

        violent intent and plots like pro. But somehow evn though i dont get any high out of this series there is something that doesn't to tally dispose of this series. I still want continue seeing it for the reason that i want to know how much more pathetic its going to get. \
If you are looking for plot like DEATHNOTE and violence like in GANTZ then this series would be ok for you.\

    Mirai Nikki\
Mirai Nikki was produced by 9 different companies. \
The studio responsible was Asread who are known for Ga-Rei: Zero and Shuffle!. \
Mirai Nikki is an adaptation of a manga of the same name created by Esuno Sakae. \
Mirai Nikki is a interesting psychological thriller revolving around a survival game with the title of God on the line. Tune in to watch 12 diverse characters manipulate and fight for the grandest prize of them all. The show is nail biting at times but suffers from some plot inconsistencies. I’m going to say that this anime is not for everyone, but it should definitely be given\
          \
        a chance. \
Story: The story revolves around a boy named Amano Yukitero who is loner. He spends his days observing the world that he has become unattached too. He is isolated and reflects on the past where he was bullied and rejected. He writes down these observations of his in his diary on his phone. The viewer learns that when he returns home he is able to connect with a god known as Deus ex Machina. Deus is dying and sees Yukitero as a perfect subject for his grand plan. He transforms Yukitero’s diary into a “Future Diary” and begins a game in which 12 individuals are gifted these cellphones which have the ability to see the future in different ways. The last of the 12 standing becomes the new god of the world. The game begins and then we meet our second main character, Gasai Yuno. She is a stalker and becomes Yukitero’s friend with the sole goal to help him survive. The two of them join forces in hopes of being the last ones standing in this survival game.\
Characters: The two main characters are the backbone of this anime. Yuki is the quiet, innocent loner and Yuno is the crazed stalker. I loved these characters, you feel for Yuki because he’s just a kid who was kind of thrust into this game and now people are trying to kill him. Then there’s Yuno. Yuno is awesome, she is insane and that is what you come to love from this show. She will often say things that she’s thinking out loud regardless of who’s around without a care in the world for others feelings. She cares for nothing except Yuki and will do ANYTHING to help him. The side characters range from boring to great, the good thing is that most characters have an agenda and stick to it. Even the lamest characters in the show have a reason for why they act and that’s all I can ask for. \
Atmosphere: This being labeled as a thriller anime requires it to have a suspenseful mood, and boy does it. There are moments in this show where the music and dialogue match perfectly for some truly terrifying moments where you’ll say “he/she wouldn’t”. There are a few twists in the show and they all deliver. They all make sense in some way so for the most part there aren’t any complaints.\
Problems: Though I liked this anime I can say the thing that keeps this from being a wonderful anime are the enormous number of plot holes in this show. You’ll constantly be asking yourself “how the hell” or “why the hell” questions regarding what characters are saying or doing. The good thing is that these plot holes, though noticeable, don’t harm the overarching story too much. However I wish the show made more sense at times. \
Art: The art was very good. Every motion was smooth and there are few if any bad spots in the anime. Part of creating a suspenseful mood involves having the visuals be scary or disturbing. Overall no problems.\
Sound: The music was good. I liked both openings because they fit the tone of the show perfectly. As I said before the music was perfect when it needed to be and played a huge role during important moments of the show. \
Overall: If you can look past some of the minor plot holes of the show and are looking for a show that will make you think about who is right and wrong then this is a great show for you. This show also contains romance which becomes more and more important as the show goes on. There are two big things that will keep you watching, who wins the game and what happens to Yuki and Yuno. Overall Mirai Nikki is a anime that you should make time to watch it.\
I’m giving Mirai Nikki an 8/10. \

Story :6\
The concept of Mirai Nikki's story  is nothing we haven't seen in films,books or other animes,the concept of a Death Game is quite used but very fun and interesting to watch.\
On this version of Battle Royale,12 people get a mobile phone which can predic the future and have to kill each other and the winner became the God of the new World,the premise is quite interesting even though,it's hard to believe that a God 'd chose a succesor with that game conformed by terrorists,serial killers,a yandere and so on.\
Anyway,on day,our main character's \"friend\",Deux ex Machina gives him a phone\
          \
        and he says him that now a lor of crazy psychopaths are going to kill him.\
It's a death game,so everyone can kill everyone,making,as a result,a thiriller with lots of unexpected plot twits,unfortunally that's not the case.\
Mirai Nikki uses this structure over and over again:\
1.A new enemy comes\
2.Tries to kill the protagonists\
3.Almost got it\
4.Flashback about his past\
5.A deaux ex machina or the enemy starts act stupid\
6.Dies\
There're some episodes about our protagonists and their relationship trying to be funny or philosophical but at the end they failed in an olympic way.\
The future diary's are forgotten almost after the firsts episodes of the show.Any strategy simple or impossible,like a 5-year-old kid use posion against the protagonists.\
However,at 17th episode the anime starts to be something really good,even though,the plans are stupid and things doesn't make sense is more intense than the rest and,personally I think it's the best part of the show,but the end is a complete shit,that's all I have to say about the end.\
Art & Animation: 3\
The animation of Mirai Nikki was made by Asread,also known by Corpse Body.\
It's average at best,the movements are tough,the battles are frozen frames of hitting,which makes it look like it was a powerpoint,the backgorunds are mediocre at best,although the animation gets better at the end.\
The character design is well done.\
\
Sound: 6\
The OST of Mirai Nikki is huge,with more more more tracks than episodes,even though,a lot of them are forgetable,there're some of them which increase a lot of tension to the scene,but mostly it's average.\
The first opening and the first ending of the show are fantastic\
The second one's are okay.\
Character:3\
Yukiteru Amano i:The main character of Mirai Nikki is a winy little pussy ala Ganta of \"Deadman Wonderland\",he's an antisocial kid who happens to be in such a cruel game.He has no strength,his only hability is throwing darts and he's insufferable.\
His cover by a huge and warm coat of plot armor,which makes him survives explosions,never gets hit by a bullet or by the power of anything he doesn't get killed when they only have to broke an object that they're holding.\
Thre's nothing more to say about him,his the typical Shinji Ikari,he deveplops a little through the story but all of this development it's thrown to the trash with that ending.\
Gasai Yuno:The co-protagonist and the main reason of the huge amount of fans that this anime got.She's a yandere,an type of girl who's so in love with a character that does EVERYTHING for him o psycho bitch with childhood issues.\
She's overpower as hell,to keep our hero,\"Yukki!!\" alive\
This character can only say \"Yukki!\",be aware of that.\
Although all of this,she's fun to watch,even though,they try to explain her and make her a \"realistic character\",which I found kind of retrarded.\
The rest of the cast is conformed by psycho bitches with childhood issues and \"tragic past\" with I lost the count of how many times they use rape and child getting beaten to explain,trying to show us \"How cruel is the world\" which make it edgy,as edgy as a fucking cliff.\
Although,2 characters stand out of the others\
The 9th:The terrorist is a character which I find far more interesting than the protagonists,plus the romance with the policeman were far better weitten,intense and lovely than the main couple one's-\
Akise Aru: The only persons who seem intelligent in the show,although he's a copy of  Kaworu (Evangelion),not only his concept is the same,the seiyuu is the same and some lines are the same,which makes him one of the best characters.\
\
Enjoyment:6\
Despite of its flaws I got fun watching Mirai Nikki,It's not bad but it's not a good show either.\
What it tries to be it's already done and it's done better.\
For simliar shows,I suggest you to watch:\
Fate/Zero-It's concept it's the same but it's far better written,whit an amazing soundtrack and a flawless animation.\
Black Lagoon-Action and action,very intense and fun to watch with a lot of pyschos and bitches being crazy.\
Higurashi no naku koro ni-For cute psycho girls killing people,with a fantastic and very well set mystery but a horrible animation\

  So this story is set on the preset.A guy isnt popular and has imaginary firends....in HIGHSCHOOL.Pretty plain huh..but oh wait the imaginary friends are actually some magical gods from another realm..and the MC is the target of a psycho bitch.The god is about to die(only one..the boss) and makes a murder game,a battle royale with 12 players where the last man/woman standing wins and becomes the god.So Yukiteru the MC treats it as a a\
          \
        joke but it soon turns that one of the prettiest girls in his class not only is in the same game but she has (at first) a one-sided crush on the MC.Oh also she is a yandere.So the two start together(after a few \"complications\") to kill every player/Yukki's friend(tho he doesnt know the last part..shhhh) so he could be betrayed in the end.\
  The sound was allright until..Yuno began literally spamming in real life the name \"Yukki\".That's one reason for my hatred of this anime.In rest the sounds were ok.\
  The characters i think were the only good part in the anime,mostly the MC's evolution from a scared,weak crybaby to allmost a psycho murdering everyone. \
  I did not enjoy this.I do not recomed it to light hearted people nor the one looking for gore.Tis anime despite having all the gory parts has a romance story incorporated which made me hate this show.If its gore be it GORE not gory romance.\

    What if I told you that this messed up, horrific and crazy anime is one of the best love stories out there? (Including the OVA)\
Mirai Nikki is simply one of the most surprising anime that I've watched. It started out boring and looked like it was poorly made during the first couple of episodes. Honestly, I was thinking about dropping it around that time. However, it slowly but surely started to become interesting, primarily because it started to take turns that I did not see coming. And I think that's primarily due to Yuno Gasai. She makes the show Mirai Nikki, Mirai Nikki. A thoroughly\
          \
        interesting and yet strangely, likable character. You’ll understand the ‘strangely’ part once you start watching it. Also, she is OP as fuck.\
The story in itself is definitely not that interesting. But the way the plot develops and the execution are what that made this anime stand out. Each episode surprises you. Bear in mind that the plot twists are not insane or “Oh, my god, what?” kinda crazy. But they are consistent. You really cannot predict what’s gonna happen in that crazy world next. And it is going to happen in each episode.\
Yes, there are a lot of plot-holes. Yes, some situations and the choices the characters make don’t make a ton of sense. Yes, some of the side characters are poorly written. This show has a bunch of valid drawbacks. And these are the reasons why it’s not a 10. But I think its entertainment factor and the characterization of Yuno Gasai make the show worth it. \
And if you’re a sucker for a happy ending, well, just go watch it.\

The story reminded me of Eden of the East, which was on my top ten list for a while. However, although the story was pretty unique...... it wasn't that great. I mean, come on. That ending?????

         All i can say is that it was like a roller coaster. By that i mean that it had ups and downs.\
     For the most part it had me hooked. It started strong then everything went downhill. But that doesn't mean it was bad overall. I say that because the start was insane, as a nice concept. It lost speed fast, until the peak at the middle of the show. It felt like it was filler even though it's not meant to be (?)\
     The series is not for everyone, mostly because\

        of the art style. A lot of gore, violence and stories that some people might find disturbing. For me though, it was one of its best features.\
     The major disappointment for me were the characters. It went the route of full-out cliche and combined everything anime gets wrong most of the time. The main character is a plain young male of age of 14. He's social skills are non existent. But out of the blue he gets hit on some pink haired chick. Sound familiar? I can also add in the list the parental problems, cop cliches, terrorist cliches but that would take ages.\
     The plot holes are there but they are easy to forget. Overall, i enjoyed it and i can happily recommend it. 7/10\

    My first ever anime series. This show took me for a ride. The story hooks you hard, throwing the young, innocent main character into a game of life and death. The show has so much character development. Nearly ever character has some sort of arc that makes them more relatable or sympathetic in some way. The characters are definitely the strongest part of the show, I started liking characters that were awful at the beginning because you get to know them all on a deeper level as the show progresses. The first quarter of the show starts a bit slowly, but as you start to\

I couldn't stop watching near the end, I felt like I was right in the middle of the story and couldn't bear to stop until I had some closure. All of the heart-breaking moments stuck with me for days to come. I would randomly remember something about the show and feel sadness. It was like I was actually heart broken and I felt real, deep sadness about the things that happened. Overall an incredible experience, one I won't forget. Mirai Nikki opened my eyes to how much a good show could really affect me emotionally.\

     Firstly, this review contains very minimal spoilers. I reveal a few character traits that should be glaringly obvious to you as a human with eyes, and not a whole lot else.\
 I watched this with a friend, having finally had enough of him casually mentioning it from time to time saying “you need to watch this” followed by this little smirk. That smirk generally doesn’t bode well with this particular friend; my past anime-watching experiences with him have told me that any time that little smirk comes into play it means there’s a very particular reason he wants me to watch whatever anime it\
          \
        is, and that generally means he plans less on watching the anime and more of watching me react to the anime.\
Let me tell you right now that he had the time of his life watching me watch Mirai Nikki. And I think he’d probably get similar entertainment out of watching anyone else, so with that as a metric I think it’s safe to say that Mirai Nikki is not only a great show to watch, but also possibly functions as a spectator sport thanks to the sheer amount of concentrated insanity that takes place through its 26 episodes.\
First let me tackle the premise. Mirai Nikki, aka The Future Diary, contains—get \
ready—diaries that predict the future. Our main character, Yukiteru Amano, has one of these diaries which is known as the “Random Diary”, in that it predicts all random events around him. His ownership of this cellphone diary puts him into a survival game against 11 others with diaries that can predict various things ranging from the events occurring to another particular character to a diary that can see into all the other diaries. These 12 competitors have to fight to the death. Whoever wins becomes the new god, taking over for the current god, Deus Ex Machina. If you’re not already at least vaguely interested, then there might be a problem. The premise is, as you can see, quite unique and clearly set up to work itself into a fascinating story. To be honest, while as ridiculous as it is from a pedestrian viewpoint, it’s very likely one of my more favorite premises I’ve come across.\
Now, on top of that, we have the other side of the premise, and that is the relationship between Yuki and his self-proclaimed bride-to-be, Yuno Gasai. That’s where the rubber really meets the road in this anime, as their relationship is a peanut butter, jelly and tuna-fish style mashup of adorable, creepy, and actually terrifying. Their obviously beleaguered relationship not only throws an entirely psychological-horror spin on the entire thing, but also absolutely positions this anime a top contender for one of my favorites of all time, and is, in my opinion, very likely the reason why it currently holds the #9 slot for popularity on MAL, although the rest of the package doesn’t disappoint either.\
As for the story, let’s just suffice it to say that the events of this survival game aren’t exactly cut-and-dried—things get very complicated very quickly for poor Yuki. I won’t spoil anything but I will say things get very wild very quickly. As tempted as I am to make a list of all the ridiculousness that transpires even early on, I won’t in an effort to keep you as blind as possible going into this, because let’s face it, if I give you anything, whoever watches you watch this (that is, if anyone else is in a situation like my viewing) simply won’t be as entertained.\
 I will say, though, the story—particularly the way a few of the player characters are tossed into the mix, is one of few areas of the anime that I feel there’s room for criticism. I understand that the tactics the players in the survival game use are characterizations of their circumstances and personalities, but nonetheless I personally feel there are a few of the players whose methods are either A. only really explained through exposition, or B. off the wall to the point of even minor annoyance. There’s two separate game participant characters in particular that I can think of that are only seemingly there to advance the plot, and I believe the lack of proper introduction (A) leads to my second complaint (B) thanks to the fact that I’m told who they are and am simply expected to go along with it, when instead a little more backstory would be of help in explaining their actions and tactics.\
The characters themselves are all interesting on some level, however as I argued in the previous paragraph I do wish there was more characterization of several characters. There are definitely times where Yuno seems to have a bit of a one-track mind (for roughly 3/4s of the anime) but that is, in an essence, her character, and while some may find that annoying, I found it interesting to watch her remain stuck on Yuki during the various changes in opinion of her Yuki himself has. On the topic of Yuki, our main character develops rather interestingly throughout the series as well, starting off at a sub-beta level of confidence in himself and progressing into an at least semi-competent, or possibly insane, human being himself. \
As far as visuals, though, I must say this anime looks absolutely up to par; no particular visual element stands out, for positive or negative, so by all means it’s not a complaint for me. There’s a few character designs that I particularly enjoyed for a wide array of reasons, namely Minene Uryuu (Ninth), Tsubaki Kasugano (Sixth), Reisuke Houjou (Fifth), Murmur, and finally, of course Yuno Gasai (Second) who I must admit is one of the best example of a wolf in sheep’s clothing I’ve ever seen, thus why she makes the list. I’ll say this much: there’s something special about an adorable pink-haired girl wielding (and very much using) an axe. The only character design that actually bothered me was Kamado Ueshita (Eighth), whose design I find almost jarring. I understand they were going for: a short, rotund woman, but in execution she looks like some horribly malformed bobblehead creature, which, when compared to the rest of the uniformly-styled and well-put-together cast, stands out, and very much not in a good way. Thankfully, her role isn’t horribly prevalent.\
The anime’s sound is also definitely worth mentioning, and for the positive. The voicing is solid and tense, the sound effects are realistic and tight, although there are times standard background noise feels a little sparse. Despite that, the soundtrack, I must say, is quite impressive. I enjoyed every song presented throughout the anime, particularly the opening themes (and both OPs are also excellent!) All the songs are paced well and provide the perfect mood for what’s taking place onscreen. \
With all that in mind, it’s probably pretty easy to figure out I really enjoyed Mirai Nikki. Sure, it’s got its flaws, but those aren’t hard to bypass considering the sheer amount of insanity taking place throughout its episodes. If you’re a newcomer to anime, then this might be one I’d save for once you’re at least a few more series deep as it’s one you’ll either love or hate—it’s not hard to see that some might be a little turned off by such a wide range of psychological disorders as presented in this anime.

The art style and animarion are cool, every single one of the characters are amazingly well made and well developed (even tho the MC is a fucking pussy at times) this anime even has maybe the best yandere ever. The openings for this anime are awesesome and I can't really recall bad things about it, maybe that some characters died really quickly... however, this anime is amazing, if\

    THIS REVIEW CONTAIN SPOILERS\
 Before I go into details let me sum it up. Decent anime with a very promising concept but it could've been executed better. If the characterisation of the MCs were done better (i will explain below), the experience of this anime would've been far more effective. Honestly the MCs are the villains. Even the other characters says so. Just put some common sense into them.\
 I am not going to talk about the 'professional' view of the anime, this is just a casual review from a weebo and the enjoyment of this anime.\
 First problem: THE MC IS HORRIBLE (Yukki mainly)\
\
        IMO, the main characters should be the ones that you should be able to sympathise to a great extent. The audience needs to feel like as if they are the MC and emotionally attach with them. Yukki and Yuno definitely didn't give me those feelings. Like I felt more sorry for relatively minor characters like Ninth and Seventh when they died. I mean HOW are you supposed to sympathise with Yukki, who is driven by a simple hope to bring his parents back, killing numerous people, and Yuno who is just straight up crazy? I mean yeah it was pretty enjoyable to make Yuno a psycho but once again it seemed like they went too far to the point where I started just hating her. \
 Now now it's not that common that the MC absolutely pissed me off but Yukki definitely did. When he started being a wimp at the start, it felt like this series was taking it too far, making me feel quite frustrated (eg him keep crying for no reason), but I was like 'hey, it's only first few eps and he will get better.' Unfortunately, the enjoyment of the story was greatly effected by the characterisation of Yukki. In contrast, Simon from Gurren Lagann and Deku from BHA changes significantly to a hero. Speaking of a hero...\
 Second Problem: THIS JUST MAKES ME FEEL FRUSTRATED\
 MC got no common sense. Near ep21 when Yukki just decides to kill all his friends is when I just lost it. Now that finally he got some guts to start killing some enemies (Like when he killed his dad's murderers), he turns into a complete psycho like Yuno? At that point it felt like the story was going nowhere and up to ep25 I was so confused with the sudden change of all the dimension crap. MC is NEVER A HERO. Lmao screw saving the world he killed so many including ALL of his friends just to be with Yuno. This was just extremely annoying to watch. \
 Now enough with the problems let's talk about some POSITIVE things.\
 Like I was saying earlier, the concept was interesting and that is what drove me through this whole series (Tbh it was all the cliffhangers). A deathmatch with a diary that tells you the future? Sounds interesting! And it was. The dimension twist(?) near the end was confusing but it did add a decent element to the story which was also nice. \
 THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT HAPPENING IN THE STORY. That really engaged me and allowed me to finish the story in a matter of days.\
 The ending was wrapped up very nicely and cleared up the mess.\
 The main reason why I gave this anime a rating of 8 instead of 7 has to lie in the ending. I personally do not like ambiguous endings and this one seemed like it really cleared the story up. This is like a bittersweet ending that worked imo. The completely changed Third World, with both Yuno and Yukki not knowing they once loved each other can be a bit sad. Yukki from second world is left broken but he finds hope at the end. The one who \"saved\" the world suffers the most. (He fucking deserves it for being a cunt). The scene where Yuno kills herself at the end would've been VERY depressing if Yuno was less of a psycho and Yukki had some common sense throughout the series. (The audience's bond between them would've been stronger)\
 Anyways just to wrap things up, the storyline of this anime wasn't too bad and the experience from this anime would have been way more effective if the characterisation allowed strong connection between MC and the audience. ",

    Why I did enjoy \"Mirai Nikki\" at first and why it fell from grace (in my opinion)\
First of all, the plot was hilarious. Honestly. The ideas the producers had and how the story proceeded was very well done. It was like a bizarre mix of \"Death Note\" and \"Steins;Gate\", with elements of both included. And, just by the plot presented, this anime could compete with Fullmetal Alchemist and Steins;Gate for the first place. \
So why didn't that happen?\
It's hard to say, where exactly this anime went downhill. Some of the characters were very convincing (Minene Uryuu [Who developed greatly from an rather medium to one\
          \
        of my favorites],Gasai Yuno [Who surprised me every time she did something, because her actions where not foreseeable, even if the rest of the casts' actions were]), some were kind of ok, and some were so damn annoying I had to take a break, because I couldn't stand them by any manner (Mur Mur)\
and some where just so mysterious, that I stopped caring (Deus Ex Machina [SPOILER: Who amused me by doing by his name one time], John Baccus].\
My twice-biggest problem is the main characters attitude to act like Shinji Ikari (not to mention Akise Arus alias Kaworu), which means, that he is completely useless most of the time. \
And my second biggest problem, is the ending. Not the ending itself to be precisely, but the way you are feeling from about episode 21 to the end. Thing is, that i personally thought, that the final has come now. And now. But now they will finish it. Oh no. They won't. They needed like five episodes to tell their ending, which was completely unnecessary. An ending is presented to you, with which you would be totally fine, but yet another one is presented, and another one. And this is, why this anime is not really worth watching. Most animes got a problem presenting an ending, or an ending with which the people can live. But this one tried to insert every element, that was successful in other animes, to his own, even if it was unnecessary to do so, because the story would have worked perfectly well without it. \
Résumé: Great start, great plot, some great some horrible characters and an ending, that just did not want to ever end. ",

    Mirai Nikki is an interesting show that plays with the ideas of purpose, love, and the very concept and operations of \"God\" and his infinite, and I do mean \"infinite\" matter of being. \
It's a battle royal style plot with less of a focus on mere survival, but rather focusing more on what it means to survive, and who is actually deserving of the prize. What matters most in this show is the relation between our introduced protagonists and its with their relationship that the most interesting and genuinely touching parts of this story revolve around. \
What makes this show interesting are the characters. Watching\
          \
        them interact with one another and seeing their story arcs and motivations are what makes the plot move forward.\
Although both the dub and the sub are respectable in their own rights, I prefer the subtitled version as I personally felt the voice actors better matched the protagonists, but the dubbed version for English speakers better fits the side characters.\

Grossed out? Unsettled? Annoyed and frustrated? Even be saddened or delighted by some of the events that transpired? I would be lying if I said Mirai Nikki was an anime that didn't mold my feelings very frequently. Many good and bad factors played into all these changes that happened in me during my time watching the show.\
Introducing diaries that can predict the future in a multitude of ways set up a great, branching storyline for the plot. In essence, it's a bloody survival game bringing out the disturbing sides of our species. All seems well\
          \
        but there were flaws that I have to point out despite this creative foundation. Before I get to that, the anime diverged from others because of the heavy focus on a lot of complex matters that linked strongly with the ideas of morality and unlawfulness. Murder, psychopath, justice and deception are some to name a few. My fascination did peaked during all the related discussions. These traits were molded within the characters who have experienced tragic backstories, developing not only their nature and personality but also promoting their survival in the game. Distinctiveness made way for unique strategies in which they face death at each turn, however, a couple of the battles lacked excitement and tension as they were contrived. Same with finding myself disappointed by the build up of many characters, only to get paid off by some undeserving or abrupt conclusion. In spite of this, some were treated well though. Another side of focus that was really intriguing was the questionable relationship of 'love' between the two main characters, a weak lonely boy with a crazy yandere girl. While they did get annoying on occasions, they served as a controversial mystery and topic that sprinkled more interest to the story.\
Adding to the discomfort from the main story was in how we see each characters in color. The most compelling aspect from the visual was in the sinister expressions of the characters, showing their bloodlust, violent temptation or madness. It also produced the more anxious atmosphere such as fear and panic. I find it to really get into your senses in a good way, watching them transform into something we don't see everyday. Color themes also contrasted between gory darkness for tension to relaxed brightness for a more peaceful setting. Similarly, the character designs felt fresh, especially in the use of the eye design. I loved its depictions throughout changing environments with an example of how it can be lifeless in more uneasy situations. As for the animation, it can get jarring and unrealistic at times during the fight scenes, being out of place to what I was expecting. But most of the time, the quality was quite average. Even though some of the voice-acting lacked emotions, the actors did a pretty good job generally. Using OSTs helped bring out some of the important factors that were lost from the lower quality in animation and voice-acting.\
So yeah, this thriller of survival game was a whole new experience to me. Its ideas were thought out brilliantly but it fell during the execution and just made certain parts of the plot weak. Contrary to this, the last several episodes of Mirai Nikki were thankfully executed with a great approach, concluding to a strong finish.",

    I'm gonna be honest, it is tough for me to review this and to justify my scores. Because I'm gonna start with talking about the enjoyment which I give a 10 here and that's because I absolutely adore this show, I watched it 5 times and I enjoyed myself every single time from the beginning until the end. \
And yet the show is FILLED with flaws. It's got it all, inconsistent story quality, inconsistent character personalities, inconsistent art quality and some pretty damn big logical issues with the story.\
The only part of the anime that in my opinion is actually flawless is the sound, the\
          \
        voices fit the characters and the music is amazing (anyone would agree that the first opening is one of the best openings ever).\
Now onto the flaws...\
The art is weird. Some characters have really good designs that stand out in a good way while some others look like parodies making the show lose what is supposed to be a dark atmosphere. Almost everyone looks quite realistic and then you got this cook who's 3 feet tall, has a head that's actually larger than its whole body and keeps walking as if she had paralyzed arms ; there is no reason for that character to look that way, it's just stupid and inconsistent.\
Then when it comes to animation it's relatively impressive ; the animations themselves sometimes feel slightly poorly made but they're at least always very smooth and they're never straight up bad.\
The story now....The idea of the story is great, the execution is lacking. The whole concept of \"you need to beat your rivals using your diaries\" almost gets forgotten at times and instead everything gets solved by pure violence when you'd really expect people trying to outwit each other using their diaries. The diaries also have another issue : a lot of them are similar to each other or feel like they don't do anything. In the end the only 2 diaries that actually get used often and properly are yuki's and yuno's but that's to be expected.\
Another big problem of the story is that a lot of events feel like they got no consequence at all. People get killed all around and it barely makes the news ; someone gets knocked out while yuno and yuki try to kill a diary owner in that person's house and when the person wakes up she doesn't ask any question and keeps going on with her life. Those are only 2 examples of loopholes but the story has got a fair bit more of those unfortunately.\
On the plus die, the anime manages to stay overall quite dark as it should be. And not just murder and creepy psychopathic girlfriend dark, we're talking 14 year old girl gets raped dark. Although at times the anime just tries to be funny by making an extremely ridiculous and out of place scene that's supposed to make you laugh but when it happens between the murder of 20 people, a young girl losing her arm and another one about to get raped, you don't want to have a funny break you just want to stay immersed in that dark story and see how it ends.\
The characters...There's just so much to say but to say it simply : if Mirai Nikki was a game of League of Legends, Gasai Yuno would be solo carrying the team while everyone else fed the entire game.\
So in case the game analogy doesn't help you I'm gonna say a bit more : Yuno is about 80% of the reason I love the anime. Every other character is either completely stupidly written or makes at least one gigantic nonsensical decision at the worst possible moment. I really can't go into depths about it without spoiling the entire show but if there is one thing you need to remember it's this : if you don't like yanderes then don't watch the anime, if you can't even enjoy yuno you will not like the show at all.\
So yeah, a lot of flaws, I almost entirely wrote about this show negatively and yet I still stand by my point : this anime is my favorite anime I ever watched. And yes it's a totally biased and unreasonable statement. I love Yuno's yandere personality and I love the Yuno x Yuki couple. And yet I know that it shouldn't be enough for me to love the show like that. I really liked Lucy in Elfenlied as well yet I wouldn't watch Elfenlied again because just liking one character isn't enough for me to enjoy an entire anime. And yet for Mirai Nikki it works, somehow and I can't explain to you why.\
So it's really up to you. Mirai Nikki is a very polarizing anime. And you will find a lot of people tell you it's the best thing ever and a lot of other people will tell you it's one of the worst anime ever. I'm not either of those people and honestly the best way for you to figure out if you'll like it or not in this case is to just watch the first 2 episodes. If by the end of episode 2 you feel neutral about Yuno, it probably won't be worth watching the rest of the show.\

    How can someone start talking in his first review? Specially when the review is for an anime like this one. I'll try to warn you of the following things:\
- This is my first review. If I don't make any kind of sense, that's why.\
- I loved and hated this anime.\
***\
Generally, a story's premisse is maintained by the things that one allows himself to know before actually reading or watching said story starting, developing and finishing. You automatically create an expectation and you end up thinking that you will love whatever you're about to read or watch due to believing that your prediction is right. \"Mirai\
          \
        Nikki\" or \"The Future Diary\" in english, was the very first anime that completely fooled me. I'll explain why.\
THE STORY: 5 out of 10\
The story goes all over the place in this anime, but it never forgets to highlight what it actually wants highlighted. If you're planing to watch this anime like I was until yesterday, you must already have seen its main male and female protagonists. 50% of the core of this plot is completely centered in these too, you have been warned.\
The other half of the core is what the premisse promised: action, blood, future prediction and many time-space related twists and a survival game in which 99% of the involved will die. \
I read reviews and noticed that many people thought that the story is pathetic and ended up a total shit, but I don't agree with that. The story delivered what it promised to deliver. Watching the first 5 episodes of the anime, it's completely possible to break down the story's structure, and you'll be completely able to notice that it barely lets the main characters give other characters a chance to be developed. \
The anime gives us heads rolling, tears, blood, a little bit of comedy, among with some other things. The flaws starts here.\
The biggest flaw of the anime for me was that it had many sexual tension, which may or may not be explained by the fact that I'm 15 years old. I just thought that many scenes were kinda ruined and didn't achieve greatness because of said thing. Regardless, even though I predict that many will find many things in this show offensive, I didn't.\
Concluding this part of the review, I couldn't predict any twist (which is good), but only because I didn't allow myself to do so.\
THE CHARACTERS: 6 out of 10\
In this part I'll just be repetitive. The main characteristic that is common for all characters is that all the relevant ones have are completely insane and broken, with some slight differences that makes all of them unique.\
The male protagonist, Amano Yukiteru does everything that is expected from him: he cries, thinks he's the victim, etc. One could say he's just annoying, but I'm just like him, that's why I predicted some of his minor decisions. Beware that he isn't as predictable as he seems though.\
The female protagonist, Gasai Yuno, is probably the character that made this anime what it is. Without her, this would be completely different. I think that you'll love her, doubt her decisions and sometimes be extremely frustrated because of her actions - at least that happened to me.\
Other flaw of the show is that it didn't give much room to give more depth and highlighting to Akise Aru and Uryuu Minene. The first one is not one of my favorite characters ever, he's MY FAVORITE CHARACTER EVER. The second is just... see for yourself. \
ANIMATION AND SOUND: 9 out of 10\
Not much to say it because I don't give much attention to the sound and animation. I enjoyed very much, that's it.\
I give it a nine just because of Yuno's voice acting.\
ENJOYMENT - 5 out of 10: \
Before I even decided  I was going to watch the show, I already was aware of a character's death, and regardless of knowing said character would die, I wanted to watch the show to watch that character. Just for that, I won't reveal which one it is because it would be a spoiler. However, I could say that my expectations for this character were completely fulfilled.\
From this I just read the show's synopsis and I believed that what I had in front of me was just a survival game. I was half right.\
In my idea, all the characters that I knew and would meet in the show were just rivals in this survival game. Main goal: being the last one standing. Once again: half right.\
If you think that \"Mirai Nikki\" will only deliver what I said previously, you're completely wrong. \"Mirai Nikki\" deserves any hype that it gets and it is pretty addicting, but it's not (at all) an anime that you will unconditionally love. Even if you love it for one reason, there will always be a reason to hate it. Watch it and find out if you love it, hate it or hate it and love it like myself.\

    *MINOR SPOILERS*\
Story - The story in this one is pretty well done in the fact that they show all the characters and how each character has their own window into the future. I feel like they distributed the story well and it was what i expected to watch. There aren't that many BIG plot holes in this one as in the beginning i was confused as how there were 3 bodies in yuno's house, but then they explained how and why that was.\
Art - The art style here is alright. It's very dark and gloomy for most of the anime. It was different than your\
          \
        traditional \"Big eyes, small nose\" type anime, but i still enjoyed the scenery.\
Sound - Sound design and the OST here are pretty damn memorable, i love the first theme song and i feel like i could rewatch the anime just for it. The diary sounds when the future changes is also very memorable. I love how they also use different sounds for different diaries when the future changes.\
Character - Starting with yuno, she was, for the most part very unpredictable, you didn't know if she was the bad guy or the good guy for MOST of the anime. Where as you had Yuki, who is more scared of his own girlfriend than a death game he's in. But i do understand why he is so scared, as his life is almost always on the line in this show. The other characters are memorable for the most part, i really like Murmur's character as you think she's just Duas' servant, but find out later that she is the founder of the game.\
\
Enjoyment - The overall enjoyment is great. Not much else to say here for the most part.\
Overall - This anime is one that a lot of people don't know about. And if they do they sit on the hate side or the great side of the fence. For me i loved this anime and i recommend you watch it yourself. It can be Cliche in some parts, but overall it's unpredictable.\

    'this is by far one of my favorite animes' is what i would say if the ending was better. let me explain.\
this anime had me hooked with the first episode, i loved every character with their special quirks which made every one of them unique to the game, and made every side character pop and have enough reason to be in the anime. \
i also loved the main characters, not so much yukiteru, but not for the story just as an actual human being, for the story he fit in perfectly.\
i can not fault this anime up until episode 22. after episode 22 it all\
          \
        got a little bit silly and it seemed that when it was written or thought up, it got to a point where they were like' hmm how are we going to end this?, its got to be dramatic and jaw dropping, i know we will do this big twist, but wait that dont make sense i know we will add this and that and then it will all be okay and then it goes all wrong . the end!'\
it just seems the whole anime had so much depth and thought and so much heart, and the ending just seemed as if it was rushed because they didnt know how to end such a explosive story.\
\
on a side note the animation is great and the opening and ending songs are brilliant, i love them both!\
in conclusion this is such a great anime and i would definitely recommend just for the ride not for the ending.\

    Hello, fellow wandering soul! If you're wondering if Mirai Nikki is worth your time, then you've come to the right place.\
 You'll like it if you enjoy bloody violence, yandere, drops of random fanservice, and yandere. You won't like it if you enjoy anime with consistent plot, mood, or meaningful characters.\
Let's get to the heart of it. Yuno Gasai, the pink-haired girl we all love to yandere. I know you're here because of that 10 hr video... you know... the one where some girl says \"Yuki\" a lot. I'm sure you know she's a yandere. If you're really a fan of yanderes, then you're going\
          \
        to love Mirai Nikki, despite its shortcomings. Watch it right now; you'll hear a million different ways to say \"Yuki.\"\
I have no problems with the art or the sound. In fact, the art is pretty crisp. Very excellent depictions of mutilation, gore, explosions, etc. The sound is decent I guess.\
MC is really annoying but is necessary to the plot, unfortunately. The other characters that appear are alright, but really just serve as plot devices.\
The story starts out decently enough. You immediately get a sense that it's gonna be some epic Hunger Games (or Battle Royale for you elitists) type stuff, combined with some Death Note style outwitting. It tries to live up to the hype, but it basically just comes down who is better at killing rather than the mind games. The story really drags during the middle of the 26-episode anime. It's only the last few episodes that get really good. Besides that, the story's tone was inconsistent and confused me. It felt episodic rather than like one whole connected story.\
Despite these criticisms from the logical part of my brain, my primal brain enjoyed the ride. Yanderes are cool, boobs are sugoi ne (yes there's actually nudity), and Yuki Yuki Yuki.\
Due to my personal enjoyment, I give Mirai Nikki a 6. Someone who likes gore and yanderes might give it an 8, and someone who's a professional critic might give it a 4. I hope this is helpful!\

    Alright pretty much Metro boomin wanted some more jigga and Mirai nikki almost delivered but fell off a little bit before halfway. Honestly i had fun watching it but if you really want to go deep into the character development and how illogically every single character acts you will cringe. \
Art- I liked the art metro boomin trusts the artist, sweg\
Sound- Not produced by young metro but still almost boomin\
Character- god damn it Yuno, Yuki is a wimpy tool, best character is 9th,  young metro rocks with her.\
Enjoyment- enjoyed it enough to binge it in 2 days so i guess it had my on\
          \
        my toes, really wanted to keep going and find out what was going to happen even though i wanted to cry because so many random ass twists and plot holes, but still enjoyed it. partially booming.\
Overall- bro if you want to watch something that will have you on the edge of your seat and piss you off, but still keep you watching, watch Miria Nikki. I don't think its a bad anime, but i dont think it deserves all of the cheese fame and how everyone thinks that metro boomin trusts this anime bc he doesnt. Its sweg but not at the same time, i enjoyed blindly, but in actuality it lacks in a lot of areas. But give it a shot, maybe you'll enjoy it, not a rewatch worthy anime, but definitely give it a shot. \

The anime has a great start, then we have to endure useless characters and plots. Thankfully, the scenario gets better towards the end with an interesting twist. A 13 episode series would have been better. Watch the first 6 and the last 6 episodes. You won’t be missing much.\
I liked the crazy scary girlfriend and how her character developed. I hated the hero who spent his time crying and all the stupid decision making that should have them all killed, but didn’t - of course.\

    No spoilers. I didn't really like the premise of this show at the start with future diaries on cellphones that cause the user to die when they break. It seemed pretty stupid and unrealistic, but I kept watching since some it had some good reviews and I liked the opening song. Yuki was a pretty dumb character and kinda frustrating to watch at the beginning, but he gets better at the end. Some of the better characters were Yuno and Minene and maybe Akise since they get enough screen time and aren't just randomly forgotten about. \
The plot was good at first but slowly gets\
          \
        worse as the show progresses. It seemed like they didn't spend enough time writing the story and focused mostly on Yuno. Yuno was a pretty great character throughout the series though and is probably why so many still like this show. The art and sound were also great and kinda reminded me of one punch man, some parts were poorly animated but it wasn't distracting.\
You should watch this if you like the premise or the whole yandere thing with Yuno a lot, but the plot wasn't that great and only some characters were fully developed and relatable. There are tons of plot holes so don't try analyzing every detail. The ending was pretty garbage and the only thing that saved it was the OVA Mirai Nikki Redial since at least it had like 30 seconds of a proper ending. \
Some scenes were done really well but some parts weren't very interesting or didn't really add to the plot at all. I had high hopes that this show would be good since its opening was definitely the best one I've ever seen, but it tended to try a little too hard to be edgy and was a little predictable or unorganized at times. You'll probably enjoy this if you're new to anime, but if you've seen a lot, you might not appreciate the plot or characters in this show since other shows have much better execution. If you want yandere though, there's not really any other show that does it better than this one.\
I'm not really sure how to rate this, some parts of the plot were fantastic, but some parts were pretty bad. It wasn't consistently mediocre or great, and I don't want to give a bad rating just because some of it was disappointing. \

    Which do you love more: the journey or the destination?\
I ask \"more\" because, as we all know, both parts are essential to a show. The beginning, the middle, and the end are what make a story.\
In the case of Mirai Nikki, however, you won't get a perfect story precisely because you won't get a perfect beginning, middle, and end.\
So I ask: do you love the journey more or the destination?\
I won't spoil anything except one unfortunate fact, which is better for you to know regardless: the ending is not fully satisfying.\
To be specific, the show is 26 episodes plus a conclusion OVA called \"Mirai Nikki\
          \
        Redial.\" Redial is the official ending; watch it after the first 26 episodes. It is conclusive; it does wrap up the series; but it's not fulfilling. It does provide answers; but it does not really give satisfactory ones.\
In short: the ending is merely mediocre.\
However, the beginning and the early middle are glorious. The late middle slowly descends into the mediocrity of the ending.\
Hence, I gave the story a 6. The beginning half was fantastic and sits at close to an 8; the latter half lurked down to a 5 or so.\
The art was good. Nothing mind-blowing, but still good.\
The music....\
Oh my goodness. The music.\
The first OP is just brilliant. It's the only thing from the show I continue to rewatch. It showcases the essence of what the show's ideal state of being was. It's excellent. Please give the OP a try, even if not the show.\
The characters are great as well, in particular Gasai Yuno. This show is really about her and her interaction and relationship with the MC. She's the reason I watched the show, to be honest.\
Hence, I enjoyed the show very much. Even with a lackluster ending, I liked it overall.\
Hence, I give it a Good score. If you like thrillers and Yuno's character, and if the OP gives you the good kind of shivers, watch the show. You'll enjoy it.\

The story is very unique and enjoyful. It has a lot of plot twists and it is unpredictuable (something I love)\

    I stumbled upon this anime while looking for psychological anime. After already devouring anime giants like death note, no life no game and monster i was looking for something similar. After getting multiple recommendations I started watching and to tell you the truth reaching up to even three episodes was painful.\
Usually reviews include pros and cons of something. While the list of cons are handful pros are non existent.\
Pros:\
The only good thing in this anime is its soundtrack. The music director has done an impeccable job of creating an amazing sound environment which goes which every scene. \
Cons:\
1. Story:\
Though initial plot gives a death note\
          \
        vibe with a young guy getting a powerful gift from a god, it never lift up from there. since the two anime have similar plot lines, one tend to compare. on one hand L is a genius mastermind who evolve from an anti hero to something which can not be expressed in words, our protagonist a wimp who never amount to anything. i would have preferred if he would have died in the very first Dead end.\
The middle and ending bears no connection to the initial start\
2. Characters:\
Not even one character evolve to be even remotely likable. The most bearable one was the detective. \
3. overall:\
I would advise you if you are looking to fulfill your mind hunger for intelligent anime, mirai nikki is not the one. ",

    Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) will give you one of the best anime experiences of your life, but that's only if you know which episodes to watch. I honestly found that the best way to watch it is to skip episodes 3 through 21. Even if you are a die-hard anime fan, before you cast my review aside because of that statement, hear me out.\
I discovered Mirai Nikki while watching anime parodies (abridges) on YouTube. After watching an abridged about it, I was only a little interested in the series itself; however, the intro song was pretty awesome. It's called Kuusou Mesorogiwi (Fantasy Mythology) by \
          \
        Yousei Teikoku. There are a few different english dubs out on YouTube, but my favorite is done by DaelynD – http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnLsKK3fEio. You'll also find a link to a free download of her rendition in the video's description. Anyway, I figured that with a song that awesome, it couldn't be that bad. I am not really a fan of anime though, so I watched the last several episodes just to see if it had enough action and plot to keep me interested, and I was blown away by what I saw. Mirai Nikki most definitely captured my interest, so I watched through the whole thing on Hulu. However, I found that a majority of the series actually manages to take away from the experience, rather than enhance it.\
Now, the reason I'm not a fan of most animes is because of the perverted 'sex-sells' moments, lots of episodes that have nothing to do with the story (filler), little action, bad fight scenes, ridiculous characters and scenarios, and just a lackluster story. If you watch the episodes that I tell you to watch, Mirai Nikki's main plot, main characters, and EVERYTHING is pretty amazing. However, episodes 3 through 21 focus a lot more on the sub plot and side characters. The side characters never seem to even question their actions, which prevents you from caring about them too much. And even worse, in those same episodes, the main characters keep doing things that deviate from their true selves; so, instead of empathizing and caring about the main characters, you'll actually keep yourself distant from them...which, you know, is the complete opposite of what you would want to do. As a whole, the series is still better than most, since there are no real filler episodes, and they manage to keep trickling out plot and some facts throughout. But it does suffer from the other things I hate about most animes, especially when it comes to the appearance of Eight (Ueshita Kamado). Why is her head 10 times bigger than anyone else? She looks ridiculous, her appearance doesn't fit with the rest, and it really should have been changed.\
I do realize that a lot of people like all those things that I hate about animes and you'll want to watch the whole thing. Or maybe you'll watch the episodes I told you to, and be curious about the rest of the show. Well, go ahead and watch it. If you do get discouraged throughout it by how the main characters keep flip-flopping and the side characters don't seem to have much of a conscience, just keep in mind that it gets better...much, much better. At first, you might find the first few episodes to be fine, but by the time you get into the late-teen episodes, I think you'll agree that the main plot has been watered down quite a bit.\
Episodes 1 and 2 inform you of the plot, and pretty much demonstrate how things are going to play out. Now when you skip to episode 22, you might be confused by what's going on, but honestly, a lot of what you're seeing was just introduced in that episode, and goes on to be explained. That's the thing about Mirai Nikki – the last several episodes do a really good job of explaining, making references, and wrapping up plot holes (all in a timely fashion), so you won't need prior knowledge of the whole series. And just so you know, episode 26 is not the final episode. There's a 2-part episode called Redial that was released separate from the rest of the series. Just look it up on YouTube and you can find it. Part 1 isn't very important; it pretty much just does a recap of the ending on episode 26, and then goes on to boring and sexual filler. You can just watch Part 2 and get all the information that you need.\
COME BACK TO READ THIS PART AFTER YOU'VE WATCHED THE SHOW! I'M GOING TO DISCLOSE SOMETHING THAT YOU MAY OR MAY NOT WANT TO KNOW. SPOILER! LAST CHANCE TO STOP READING! SPOILER!\
If you're like me, you might have wondered what happened to the third incarnation Yuki. Episode 26 and Redial cover what it's like for all the other characters in the third incarnation world, but I had watched the last several episodes twice, and I don't recall ever seeing or hearing much about the third incarnation Yuki. So I did some looking around and watched some parts again, and I found that I didn't pay close enough attention. In episode 26, when the third incarnation Yuno is sitting with her friends and looks out the window; it shows Yuki with his parents and a girl. In one of the episodes, Yuki had asked this girl out and was refused, but in this world not only did his parents stay together, but the girl accepted Yuki (this is the same girl that Yuno forced on Yuki when he was trapped in the sphere. Weird how the girl looks so much like Yuki's mother). I guess I kept missing out on this since I was too busy listening to and reading what Yuno was saying. If you caught it, good for you...I somehow missed it twice :/\
Lastly – I hate how Masumi Nishijima just blindly loved Minene Uryu right from the start. When they first meet (which it flashbacks to in episode 10), she's a wanted terrorist, but he treats her like a normal girl. She ends up shooting him and escaping. She then goes on to blow up children at the school in an attempt to kill Yuki. They then meet again in a hostage situation at a hospital, but he still treats her just fine. As things progress, it never comes up and he just loves her for being so damn...purple-haired or whatever it is that he likes. This is what I'm talking about when I said that the side characters don't seem to question anything. Right from the start, he loved her, and that was just how it's going to be. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad that there was a happy ending where she ended up changing and they had a mutual love and children, but their relationship should have started out with much more hate.\

    Imagine a show that didn’t just “jump the shark” but became the very shark itself during its 26 episode run. Created by manga artist/writer Esuno Sakae, and animated by Asread, Mirai Nikki is an utterly over-the-top, insanely great series that consistently delivered with twists carried out by deus ex machina characters riding a trainwreck of a plot with reckless energy that absorbed every fatal flaw of narration and obliterated them to smithereens.\
Mirai Nikki is a balancing act between high camp and the absurdity of classic anime tropes, a dialectical negotiation between the two poles that ebb and flows each episode. Most bloggers failed to note\
          \
        this, and chose to highlight only one pole, only to exaggerate its virtues or vices, which deep sixed their critique.\
The reason its absurdity succeeded where many others fail because Mirai Nikki established fantastic premises and contrivances, yet remained well-written and consistent in sheer implausibility by sticking within those bounds. When other shows establish clear conditions and then flagrantly ignores them for convenience, they are shoddily written with inconsistencies.\
Synopsis: A standard battle royal set in Japan where twelve competitors are selected to participate in a game with mobile phones that predict the future and the last person standing becomes the next “Lord of space & time.” However, the fact that the competing Future Diaries only predicted a possible future, rather than tell it, made for high drama.\
Characters\
Yukiteru Asano: a socially awkward 14-year-old whose neuroses and psyche became a Rorschach inkblot test of the audience. Being closer to the anti-hero of the spectrum of protagonists, he was less than ideal character for the audience to identify with. However, where clones of Yuji Everylead the Bland ™ populate the landscape of anime, Yukiteru was a self-aware wimp who wanted to break free from his loner habits. His Future Diary was a random one that passively recorded the events around him, but nothing about himself. That missing gap is filled by Yuno’s stalker diary, which consisted solely of information about the object of her obsession.\
Yuno Gasai: the indisputable Queen of all yanderes, Yuno struck a fine line between dere dere and yanderu, and switched between them smoothly. Most important, her dere was authentic, not some cheap stand-in for a deeper complex. That alone supercharged every “normal” moment as a fraught one with tension.\
The reason the main leads played off each other so well was the deep tension between Yukiteru’s naive yet earnest idealistic desires (friendship & loving family) and Yuno’s paranoid, cynical intuitions. Then again, Yukiteru lacked the convictions his ideals required, and Yuno’s cynicism spurred her violent tendencies, constantly exaggerating the tension with each passing episode. Yukiteru believed in the best of people and wanted to make friends and save everyone, but he did not have the necessary character. Moreover, he could not truly trust Yuno, despite the fact that she was a realist whose cynical intuitions were almost always right.\
This tension was one of the strengths of the show – what Yukiteru wanted, Yuno could never give him, despite the fact she often saved his life. Yuno was named after Juno, the Queen of the Roman pantheon. It is worth noting that Juno was transposed from the Greek Hera, the most jealous of all goddesses in mythology. More interesting is how Yuno turned out to be Yukiteru’s anima, the feminine inner personality that helped the male subject to open up emotionally and evolve.\
There are many other intriguing characters, such as an albino as the world’s greatest boy detective and an purple-haired atheist terrorist bomber who wears hot pink maid uniforms, but I’ve already said too much.\
Conclusion: Mirai Nikki is a masterpiece of execution that surpassed its less than stellar technical merits (animation) and improved on the source material (the original manga was full of plot-holes that ended up being the plot itself). While there certainly are other shows with better production values, stronger characters or stories with greater impact, personally, none of them were as addicting or as much fun. I found myself refreshing the nyaa page every Sunday night for the fansubs. So, I recommend this thrilling rollercoaster ride – as long your level of suspension is held relatively high and your analytic tendencies are kept at a safe distance, then you are guaranteed a visceral thrill rush.\

    On the whole, Mirai Nikki delivers itself well and effectively. There are a couple of issues but they do not detract from the anime enough to hinder watching it. An interesting idea coupled with a great delivery made it incredibly enjoyable.\
Story - 9\
The story really is fantastic. The psychological aspect is handled extremely well, as well as the horror and mystery. It has some phenomenal twists that really succeed in throwing the viewer off balance, but are still believable. The only real issue, and this is perhaps the biggest problem within the anime, is the romance. Despite being fairly central to the plot, it is\
          \
        not handled well at all. It exists but is almost entirely unbelievable with the possible exception of Gasai Yuno. If you come into the animation with the intention of watching a romance story, you will be disappointed. It may be a romance at it's core, but it seems to realise that it does not provide well, so it does not focus to heavily on the romantic side of things unless it really has to. This is definitely a good thing. Regardless, the fact that it is done so badly cannot be ignored. This is the only reason the story did not receive a 10.\
Art - 9\
There is never any really reason fro art to lose points unless it interferes with the viewers pleasure. Again, this is done quite well and it fit the style of the anime. There are, however, a couple of points where animation  does not match what the anime has previously produced, thus the 9.\
Sound - 7\
While enjoyable, there is nothing particularly special about the sound. Music is generally unnoticed when something is going on, which is unfortunate because there are often cases where it could improve the delivery(important!). The opening and ending themes are really good and they match the anime but, as they are only the credits, this is unimportant. Sound did not lose points because anything was bad, just because nothing was very gripping or noticeably good.\
Character - 8\
Characterisation is a large problem. A lot of the characters are awful. They simply just seem unable to decide who they are in terms of thought processes, actions and general behaviour. This is countered by the other characters who are absolutely incredible(I'm looking at Gasai Yuno in particular, but others are also amazing). They more than make up for the failure of other characters, not including Amano Yukiteru, the main character. This is primarily because he is always in the centre of everything, an (in this case)unfortunate side effect of being the main protagonist. Still, it is fascinating to look at the characters that are done well and it is possible to ignore the faults if one is extremely generous when taking circumstances into account.\
Enjoyment - 8 \
It is an enjoyable experience watching Mirai Nikki. This should be evident. The issues in story and character are not so major as to take away from the anime substantially. It has its problems but they are not too major. If you want an entertaining psychological horror story while being surprised with the turn of events, give Mirai Nikki a go.\

    Tried waaay too hard to be dark and edgy but most of of the time just came off really ridiculous, pretentious and downright stupid.\
Fast pacing.\
I stated watching because of Yuno but even her got annoying after a while.\
Majority of the characters are disappointingly bland and remained mediocre at best. I felt no attachment to any of them whatsoever. Not to mention there are some really terrible character designs....\
The romance between Yuno and Yuuki is so forced and cringe worthy.\
Oh and then there is the typical whiny and forgettable main protagonist Yuuki....Holy shit....and I thought Shinji Akari was bad....\
Ridiculous amount of plot holes.\
The first opening kicks\
          \
        ass.\
But other than that, this anime was nothing special. The battle royale concept has been done elsewhere and better. Try deadman wonderland, it's slightly better. Then go watch fate zero and higurashi no naku koro ni.\
However it did it's job as a piece of entertainment and I enjoyed it, to an extent. \
Turn your brain off if you want to properly enjoy this hot mess of an anime.\

    One of the most twisted anime I've started to watch this year. \
Story (9) - A \"Future Diary\" - maybe a bit cliched with other previous anime that has been released but still has its own awesomeness in every way. The very concept of the story is really great. You might get a bit lost in the beginning of the story but with every episode you'll really get to know the truth behind each characters.  All-in-all awesomely twisted!\
Art (9) - Blood and gore, funny and crazy faces - traditional smoke effects, rain and some cgi explosions. The \"brilliant guy\", I don't know if \
          \
        its just me but it seems on the early episodes he doesn't really look that good until the episode he got his \"Brilliant Diary\"  - great artwork.\
Sound (9) - 'really love the openings and endings and really jives with the whole story and characters. Rocking!\
Character (9) - Did I already said awesome? Well I can't help it, the characters are really awesome - each has there own twist in the story! My favorite - Gasai Yuno - the most twisted high-school girl who have obsessive issues with Yuki... and yah she really have some issues - but in the end you'll know why she's that twisted. And the \"brilliant guy\" the guy who would always bully Yukiteru - really funny!\
Enjoyment (9) - Totally enjoying every episode of it and really gets me hanging 'till the next episodes - I just hate it that it only get to 26 episodes.\
Overall (9) - I would highly recommend to watch - but only for those who could tolerate tons of blood and gore and yeah dead people!\
So, how cool it is to have one and would you do if you have one - a future diary!\

    Mirai Nikki is a psychological thriller about a group of people in a battle to the death to see who will become God. Mirai Nikki has a unique set of characters that are fun to watch but the one character that stands out is Yuno Gasai. Yuno brings most of the action and horror aspects out in this show in ways l have not seen in other anime every time time she was on screen she always entertained no matter what she was doing for example being a crazy stalker or a murdering psychopath. \

    I don't ever write reviews but I am for this anime. I just could not stand how terrible the story and characters were! I refuse to give any anime a 1 which is why I gave this anime a 2. \
The character were so poorly developed and weak that I had no vested interest in the show. The story line jumped from place to place with little rhyme or reason aside from trying to be edgy or create some kind of twist. I was thinking the entire time that somehow there would be intense fights with diary owners playing off of each other like an\
          \
        intense game of chess but alas I was disappointed. I really believe this is probably one of if not my least favorite anime now.\
On a side not I cannot believe how many people talk about Yuno being a good character or saying she and Yuki would make a great couple. She is insane! A protagonist that has even the slightest bit of strength would have killed her or found a way to leave her behind after about episode 4 or 5. \

    Lets get this out of the way, right now. Future Diary is, first and foremost, a Seinin Fight series. No two ways about that, it is what it is.\
That being said it is one of the best Fight Series I have ever had the privilege of watching.\
The animation is top notch, its nothing less than pure visual porn, stimulating and bright when it needs to be without being too obnoxious while balancing shadow and contrast just right without obscuring the characters completely and to complement the pure eyegasm is probably one of the most solid audio of the season, starting with best opening of the\
          \
        season, every beat of it a perfect compliment to the show about to follow.\
The music and sound inside is also very well put together all tied together with a fantastic Voice Cast, a very honourable mention goes to Tomosa Murata who delivers a hauntingly psychotic performance as the leading lady, Yuno Gasai.\
Even Mizusu Togashi manages to make the wimpy protagonist, Yukkiteru Amano, sound respectable. But more on Yukki later.\
The plot comes along pretty quickly, not 10 minutes into the first episode and we're already being drowned in it.\
Yukkiteru Amano, a rather awkward child, lives a life of isolation, although not for lack of trying on anyone else's part, its all a personal choice on his part, spending all his days just watching people go about their days, recording everything that happens around him on his cellphone in Diary format, before going home at the end of the day and doing nothing but sitting on his bed and going over his entries for the day.\
It is at this point that we are introduced to Dues Ex Machina (Voiced by Norio Wakamoto) and his lollipop assistant Mur Mur (Voiced by Manami Honda), Yukki's imaginary friends, because apparently he can't be bothered to accept the hands of friendship constantly extended to him at school but has all the time in the world to imagine up 2 non-existent friends and an entire environment for them to inhabit.\
But, I digress.\
This theme of friendship becomes quickly shoehorned into Yukki's motivations for most anything, as time moves on and he quickly realises just how he's been quashing his need for friends instead of the attitude he is introduced with as not really giving two damns.\
 But once more, I digress.\
I can't really explain more without ruining the plot of episode 1 and a little of episode 2, but in the end it turns out Dues is in fact not Yukki's imaginary friend and instead an Omnipotent God with a fetish for Death Matches who has recruited not only Yukki, but 11 others, into a Battle Royale for the coveted position of God's Successor.\
By using Diarys that can predict the future. True story.\
Each Diary, as we quickly learn, is unique to each combatant, each one predicting the future differently.\
But, the plot is not where the show's strength lies, the true strength is in its characters and their constant development. Except the characters who are only around for a single episode, but they don't really matter.\
Each character has a rich, vibrant back story, delving not only into their motivations but also into just what made them the way they are.\
There are even little omake type side stories at the end of each episode (Er, besides 9 so far) that go on to explain their receivership of their respective diaries.\
And on that note, lets talk about our leads, Yukkiteru Amano and Yuno Gasai. Or as I like to call them, The Stalker and her Wimp.\
The Stalker.\
To the outside observer, Miss Yuno Gasai is every bit the model student she portrays, smart, athletic and sexy, she is the envy of every girl and the desire of every boy. But beneath the veneer of perfection lies a crazed murderer with an obsessive streak.\
Put simply the real Yuno Gasai is Nutso Loco. Yes, with the capitols and everything.\
This young lady has developed an absolute obsession with protagonist Yukki, to the point that when her diary is revealed to us, it doesn't tell anything of her future or her surroundings but instead predicts the events circling Yukki and his actions 10 minutes prior to said actions.\
Also, as we learn around about episode 6, it isn't the most objective of diaries either.\
While we haven't seen to much of her backstory to this point, we have been given pretty clear and disturbing insight into her psyche and into her obsession with Yukkiteru.\
Which brings me to my next sticking point.\
Yukkiteru Amano is an irritating, manipulative, thick headed, anti-social dick slice. I apologise for the language, but I'm really not sure I could have expressed just how irredeemable a character he is.\
Well, no. That might be an over exaggeration, he does get better over the course of the first few episodes, before he becomes a completely different kind of annoying while still retaining alot of the aspects that previously made him annoying without really shedding too much else.\
There are moments of Yukki that I do really enjoy (There's a part in episode 7 or 8 where he just bleeds epic) but overall as a character, and more importantly as a Protagonist, I just can't enjoy him that much, and the show suffers for it.\
At the end of the day though, as basic as the plot is and as God awful Yukki is, the show is still one of the best of the season with some of the better visuals (I reckon if it gets a little more funding later episodes could be Fate/Zero level) and the music and characters surrounding our protagonist, warts and all, make for a more than enjoyable and quite a unique watch. As far as Fight Series go.\
If you haven't seen this yet, or you've been on the fence for the last 9 weeks, I wholeheartedly say give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.\
Except with Yukki. Always with Yukki.\

    Imagine this. There are eleven people around you who want to murder you. To make things worse, you have no idea what their faces look like, and you are not very strong to begin with. A cute, mysterious girl appears and wants to help you fight your battle. Why? You don't know yet...\
This is the basis of Mirai Nikki, or Future Diary. Mirai Nikki contains a mixture of romance, blood and gore, and shocking twists around every corner. As a fan of these type of blood bath animes, this is one of the best I have watched. Read on in this spoiler free review to\
          \
        know more.\
Story (8):\
Oh, how I love the story in this anime. While I've never been an uber fan of romance-centered plots, this one packs in tons of bloody violence, dark humor, and edge of your seat moments. The story flows very well through most of the episodes. That being said, I think through the middle it lost its way at times. The best part of the anime for me was definitely between Episodes 18 to 24. Like many others, I was not a fan of some aspects of the conclusion. Parts of it were too complex and out out of left field for my liking. Overall, very good.\
Art (9):\
The artwork here is fantastic. The blood-soaked battles and explosions looked menacing and haunting as they should have. The animation was very fluent, which is always important in this type of anime. The only reason it did not get a ten is because I have seen a few other animes with slightly better art.\
Sound (10):\
What can I say, the sound in Mirai Nikki is beyond awesome. The first intro perfectly matched the gloomy images projected on the screen. The tune gets stuck in my head a lot. I also loved the second intro song as well, but I did not like it as well as the first. The other music was also fantastic. The music in the dramatic or sad scenes were some of the best I have ever heard anywhere. The tracks paralleled the emotions of the characters with perfection.\
Character (9):\
Mirai Nikki hosts a stupendous cast of colorful characters. Each of the twelve competitors possess different motivations, personalities, and appearances. The supporting characters who are not a part of the game such as the mysterious Aru Akise, the dynamic Kosaka, and the cute duo of Hinata and Mao Chan add to the charm of the delightful cast. The only disappointing aspect here is that too many of the characters are killed off too quickly, so they do not fully get developed. Examples of this are Twelfth, Third, and Tenth, among others. However, the main characters along with two other supporting characters, Fourth and Seventh, are developed. First, Second, and Ninth go through very complete character arcs.\
Enjoyment (9):\
I highly enjoyed this anime. It kept me on the edge of my seat and wanting more. The aspects that make this not a 10 are a few episodes where the romance plot overbears the action by too much, and the ending left me disappointed and a little confused. I feel it makes things up and alienates the audience a bit. Overall, Mikai Nikki was one great ride.\
Overall (9):\
In my fairly brief time watching anime, this one has to be on my very favorites I have watched. The plot clicks at a rapid pace, the action is tight, the romance is believable and well done, the characters are very memorable, and it has surprising depth. Though the ending and some lack of character development weigh this show down, it is still awesome. If you love intensity, jot down a to do list in your Diary to watch this anime. I guarantee no DEAD END will follow.\

    This is one of my favorite \"survival game\" anime.  In this world we multiple opponents facing off for the grand prize to be GOD!  Yes, that's right GOD of the universe.  Equipped with only a phone that can predict the future (with certain catches for each character i.e:  the escape phone can show the future in a way that tells it's user how to escape certain situations or the lover's phone where it only shows the future of phones owner's love's future.) and these people must kill each other off one by one in a certain time frame or the universe\
          \
        will cease to exist!  Now the fun part of this anime is that since these characters can see the future they can alter how they will react and thus change the course of events (anti-fate if you will) so it's almost like a really complex chess game mixed with social media.  \
I don't want to go too much into but this is an amazing, modern day anime.  It has awesome characters and great relationships that develop.  And the twist at the end is one of the greatest twists I have ever come across in an anime.\

    *Warning, this review will contain profanities*\
*Warning this review will contain spoilers*\
If nothing else, Mirai Nikki was on hell of a psychological thriller that kept you on the edge of your seat after almost every episode. Why is that you may ask, well I'll tell you why..... \
Character:\
Gasai Yuno (Yuno), thats why. This 14 year old high school girl is probably the most fucked in the head anime character I have seen in recent memory. She is straight up mental, and I'm sure that anyone who has seen the anime can attest to that. \
Throughout the anime, she falls for the other main protagonist, Amano Yukiteru\
          \
        (Yuki), whose personality is a little different from Yuno's. Yuki is more a little faggot boy high school reject. He doesn't really have much friends, and tends to keep to himself for that most part, even when Yuno was straight up throwing her crazy self right at him, he would just push her away\
Now near the end of the anime, Yuki does even up growing some balls, and he even manages to get himself laid (yes with yuno). It seemed as though this weirdo ass relationship between the two was going to work, until..... he found out that the Yuno that he fucked was actually a Yuno from the past who won the game and became god, but was really lonely without Yuki so she went into the future and killed the Yuno of that timeline and became the new Yuno of that timeline in order to be with the Yuki of that timeline. Told you she was one crazy bitch. \
Storyline\
Mirai Nikki had a pretty unique story line to it. A game set up by the worlds deteriorating \"god\" with 12 contestants, where the winner of the game gets the prize of becoming the new god. How do you win the game? Simple, just kill everyone else in the game. \
The anime itself wasn't too difficult to follow for the most part, everything was happening at a very reasonable pace... that is until the end. The ending of the anime was a giant mass of cluster fuck. There was so much shit going on that it was really difficult to really understand what was going on, it kinda seemed a little rushed (another episode or two could've helped maybe), and the ending itself was a little predictable (which is really unlike the way the entire anime was going). Though all in all, if you focused and really concentrated, you should be able to follow the ending and understand what happened, though whether or not you will like the ending is a different story.\
Conclusion\
Mirai Nikki was really intense anime, with a very unique story line. The character development was top notch, with Gasai Yuno easily being  the perfect character to keep you on the edge of your seat after every episode. \
Overall it was a very injoyable experience, I would definitely say that its worth a watch.\
Rating: 7.8/10 \
(I know i gave it a 8/10 up top and on my anime list, thats because i couldn't give it a 7.8 and it was better then a 7)\

    I just want to write a short review, \
this anime is worth it's watch. \
(End. Lol)\
I particularly enjoyed it and it's twists and turns, although its got a wimpy protagonist ( a BIG no no in my book usually), his development alone could bring a 'character' rating up to 7, but couple it with Yuno's wonderfully dark and complicated past which totally explains her behaviour it's an easy 8, I'd argue a 9.\
 People tend to underestimate just how much her past justifies what she's like, in comparison Yukiteru is just a wimp (which he is, but anyway) and a past that is explained in\
          \
        depth to justify the unusual aspects of a character is scarcely spared in an anime. Unless you've got massive development time like on-going shounens. So I liked that. \
My review doesn't give much of any spoiler, which is something I had the beauty of, I watched this because it was on my recommendations, and has no review spoilers to kill the fun. SERIOUSLY, IF THEY WARN YOU THERE'S A SPOILER, DON'T READ THE SPOILER. This show needs to take you by surprise in order to generate enough impact - that is not a con, when it was aired on TV few people knew what to expect next episode, and that's part of the thrill, that's how people get engrossed in simulcasts and start to really love an anime generally. 'Where are they going to go with this! It was all so formulaic in episode 1 & 2!' Madoka Magica is going to be my shining example for this. \
Music didn't pop at me. But I'm so busying reading subs I am able to enjoy good art, but I don't have left over brain power for the soundtrack. I tend to skip OP's and EDs as well when I'm streaming an already fully released anime (Unless they're amazing, Mirai Nikki's was not outstanding). \
Listen, anyway, I'd give this a 9, that's genuinely how much I enjoyed it's development and underlying story, I didn't care to much about the survival premise, that was more of an initiator if you ask me, it's plot is much deeper and much cooler.    Give it a go, it's not really worthy of a MAL '9', but it's definitely average or more, any less is cruelty and to be honest, unagreeable. Enjoy!\

    I genuinely enjoyed the series. The concept of the show is a Hunger Games like showdown between 12 contestants using diaries that can tell the future. While this is what Mirai Nikki is sold as, I think the real draw of Miria Nikki is the relationship between Yuno and Yuki.\
Yuki, the main character, is an incredibly naive boy who is quick to forgive people. This major character flaw is played out beautifully against him. While at times it got frustrating to watch, it is also what makes him somewhat of a redeemable character.\
Yuno is a mentally unstable girl who is completely obsessed with Yuki and\
          \
        from this emerges a complex and engaging character. Her draw isn't that she is likable. Her draw is her unpredictability and the way her crumbling mental state is played out through the series. \
Her relationship with Yuki is a far cry from the tame romantic subplots that one encounters in most anime (and in most story telling mediums in general). At its best it's vaguely disturbing. At its very worst, it's downright horrifying. The author does not shy away from the gory details. I often found myself incredibly uncomfortable with the sexual components of their relationship. At the same time, it was a very fascinating dynamic to watch and the main reason I enjoyed the series.\
That said, there are a few problems I have with this anime\
-There were a few incohesive plot elements. \
-Some of the character development felt forced. In particular, I felt that Yuki's character development was rather abrupt near the end of the series. \
-There is fan service where there there really should not be fan service. The sexualization of 14 year old Yuno made me uncomfortable, particularly when you consider her mental instability. \
I would also like to mention that there are a lot of potential triggers. Violence, rape, child abuse, and suicide are all reoccurring elements of the series. I would be cautious watching Mirai Nikki if you have trouble with any of these things. \

    Where to start with Mirai Nikki.\
First of all, I didn't really know what to expect of this anime. \
(I'll do my best without spoiling) There was many a time when I hated Yuki for being stubborn, and Yuno for being...well....Yuno. I honestly felt like most characters in this anime were completely self centred. This made it difficult for me to enjoy it at times.\
By about the 15th episode it starts to lose the plot, literally, and metaphorically. I found myself just watching it just to finish the series, not for the story. It basically falls apart completely and becomes so random and cliff hanger-y that\
          \
        it becomes too frustrating to watch. \
I still cried in the end even though it was a little bit ridiculous. All through out I just wanted the relationship to work and it never did and I felt a bit ripped off by the end of the series. \
Sadly, i've written a negative review. So let me include some positives:\
- The plot twists are very random so you don't see the details of them coming.\
- the moments where the young love blossoms is really sweet, and I really rooted for Yuno and Yuki's love.\
- NO ANIMALS WERE KILLED! YAY FINALLY. \
Mmm, that's about it. I did really enjoy this anime up until half way through. \
Still though, not a bad experience watching it. Give it a try, you might enjoy it more than I did. :)\

    - English Review (Translated version)\
I'll be clear and direct from the start: \"Mirai Nikki\" is a great anime. If you ask me if it is worth seeing, I would say of course with totality. Now, normally in anime (and any kind of story in reality) the protagonists usually have a key importance in its quality. Logical, right? Well... here the opposite happens. Yes, \"Mirai Nikki\" is a marvelous series, but this is not thanks to the protagonist, on the contrary it is IN SPITE OF the protagonist.\
Seriously, it may sound exaggerated, but not at all. Yukiteru is the most insufferable, stupid, unbearable, annoying, irritating, pathetic\
          \
        and so many synonyms that I have had the misfortune to suffer ever. I hate with all my strength the \"superheroes\" mains, perfects and without any fault, but damn... since today I also hate deeply those who are the opposite. Is it so difficult to make one that is credible and balanced?\
After this devastating beginning, I will review the highlights and positive things of this anime, which basically is practically everything else. Since I started talking about characters, I'm going to continue there. It is a very common problem when presenting multitude of characters that repeat patterns/personalities in some and others remain simply as mere padding. This is not the case here.\
And this is one of the strengths of \"Mirai Nikki\": a group of characters ample and complex, but at the same time solid and varied. Each and every one of the diary owners have their moment of glory during the story and also each one has its mark of identity and way of being, which brings a freshness and a truly interesting plurality to the whole. Characters like Minene (the Ninth) or Marco and Ai (the Sevenths) have a brutal background to be secondary characters. I do not forget the others as Aru, Nishijima, Maru Maru or Hinata, who are also very remarkable.\
At this moment surely somebody is wondering why I have not named Yuno yet. Let's see... I know she is by far the favorite character of a lot of people (almost 22,000 users in MAL, that's nothing!), but... I can not agree with that. I'm so sorry, but her personality is too histrionic for me. I mean, it's not unbearable or extremely ridiculous as Yuki, but anyway she is not my style. And I have her annoying way of call Yuki drive into my mind. If I had been given a euro for every time she said it during the series, I would be the richest man in the world right now.\
No good characters serve if the plot does not accompany, but in \"Mirai Nikki\" also does. It's the typical anime when an episode ends you need to see the next whatever you have to do. The scriptwriters made sure of it with the most marked and interesting cliffhangers that I have never seen in a japanese production. Special mention also for some fantastic script twists.\
Intrigue and mystery are the keys to the story, but nevertheless it is not the only thing on which it is based, even if it is the most important part. There is also place for comedy (diary owner 12, Yuki's mother), for action (especially towards the end there are very well-worn confrontations), for the drama (stories like those of the Sixth or Seventh are very hard) and of course for romance (and here I am talking about Nishijima and the Ninth, not about the sickly thing supposed to be \"love\" between Yuki and Yuno).\
The soundtrack is simply spectacular. The melodies that sound during the scenes accompany perfectly and are perfectly calibrated with each of the different moments. About the openings and endings (because there are two of each, something I hate in a single season) I personally prefer the second ending, which is an instrumental marvel, especially the first few seconds, and its melancholic but strongly style defined perfectly what is \"Mirai Nikki\".\
PS: Aru Akise is the fucking Daraen (Robin for the Americans) of Fire Emblem Awakening.\

- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)\
Voy a ser claro y directo desde el inicio: \"Mirai Nikki\" es un anime genial. Si me preguntaran si merece la pena verlo diría que por supuesto con total rotundidad. Ahora bien, normalmente en los anime (y cualquier tipo de historia en realidad) los protagonistas suelen tener un peso y una importancia claves en que ésta termine siendo de calidad. Lógico, ¿no? Bien... pues aquí ocurre todo lo contrario. Sí, \"Mira Nikki\" es una gran serie, pero desde luego esto no es gracias al protagonista, al contrario y sin duda es A PESAR del protagonista.\
En serio, quizás suene exagerado, pero para nada. Yukiteru es el protagonista más insufrible, estúpido, insoportable, molesto, irritante, patético y otros tantos adjetivos del estilo, que he tenido la desgracia de padecer jamás. Probablemente sea el que más de toda la historia del anime, que se dice pronto. Odio con todas mis fuerzas a los protagonistas \"súperheroes\", perfectos y sin ningún fallo, pero joder... desde hoy mismo también odio con todas mis fuerzas los que son todo lo contrario. ¿Tan difícil es hacer uno que sea creíble y equilibrado?\
Después de este demoledor inicio, voy a repasar los puntos destacables y positivos que tiene el anime, que básicamente es prácticamente todo lo demás. Como he empezado hablando de personajes, voy a continuar por ahí. Es un problema muy común cuando se presentan multitud de personajes que se repiten patrones/personalidades en algunos y otros quedan simplemente como mero relleno. No es el caso aquí.\
Y es que éste es uno de los puntos fuertes de \"Mirai Nikki\": una terna de personajes amplia y compleja, pero a la vez sólida y variada.  Todos y cada uno de los poseedores de diario tienen su momento de gloria durante la historia y además cada uno tiene su seña de identidad y forma de ser, lo que le aporta una frescura y una pluralidad verdaderamente interesante al conjunto. Personajes como Minene (la Novena) o Marco y Ai (los Séptimos) tienen un trasfondo brutal para ser personajes secundarios y esto se nota. No me olvido de los demás, ni tampoco de los secundarios \"al uso\" como Aru, Nishijima, Maru Maru o Hinata, que también son muy destacables.\
En este momento seguro que alguno se está preguntando que por qué aún no he nombrado siquiera a Yuno. Veamos... sé que es con mucha diferencia el personaje favorito de muchos (casi 22.000 personas en MAL, ahí es nada), pero... yo no puedo estar de acuerdo con eso. Lo siento en el alma, pero su personalidad es excesivamente histriónica para mí. Quiero decir, no es tan insoportable ni extremadamente ridícula como Yuki, pero la forma de ser que tiene no va conmigo, no termina de resultarme creíble. Además tengo su maldita y desagradable forma de decir Yuki incrustada en la cabeza aún. Si me hubieran dado un euro por cada vez que lo dice durante la serie, ahora mismo sería el más rico del mundo.\
De nada sirven unos buenos personajes si el argumento no acompaña, pero en \"Mirai Nikki\" también lo hace. Es el típico anime en el que termina un capítulo y necesitas ver el siguiente sea lo que sea que tengas que hacer. Los guionistas se aseguraron de ello con los cliffhangers más marcados e interesantes que he visto nunca en una producción japonesa. Mención especial también para algún que otro giro de guión fantástico.\
La intriga y el misterio son las claves de su historia, pero a pesar de ello no es lo único en lo que se basa, aunque sí sea la parte más importante. Igualmente hay hueco para la comedia (dueño número 12, la madre de Yuki), para la acción (especialmente hacia el final hay enfrentamientos muy bien llevados), para el drama (historias como las de la Sexta o los Séptimos son durísimas) y por supuesto para el romance (y aquí hablo de Nishijima y la Novena, no de esa cosa enfermiza que se supone \"amor\" entre Yuki y Yuno).\
La banda sonora es simplemente espectacular. Las melodías que suenan durante las escenas acompañan perfectamente y están perfectamente calibradas con cada uno de los diferentes momentos. Especialmente hay una versión a piano de uno de los endings que pone los pelos de punta. De los openings y los endings (porque hay dos de cada, cómo odio que hagan esto en una sola temporada) yo personalmente me quedo con el segundo ending, que es una maravilla instrumental, especialmente los primeros segundos y en el que su estilo melancólico pero con fuerza define perfectamente lo que es \"Mirai Nikki\".\
PD: Aru Akise es el jodido Daraen (Robin para los estadounidenses) de Fire Emblem Awakening.\

    Notice: A couple of spoilers might pop up :) you have been warned! and a couple of grammatical mistakes.\
This will be my first review ever! So, don't butcher me to much :D\
The reason why I wanted to see Mirai Nikki is because, I kept seeing pictures of psycho yuno! and then I saw the opening of the show on youtube and then I just said oh hell yeah I have to fucking watch this.\
My first ever Survival Games anime I have ever watched. I'll have to say I enjoyed it so much from the beginning to the end of the anime. BUT! I did have\
          \
        a couple issues with the show now lets get into the review\
Story 8.5/10: Mirai Nikki had a really interesting story, it was something new that I had never seen before.  It had that little \"Romantic\" feel,  but I'm not talking about the type of romance we are adapted to, I'm talking about that crazy, let me pet your chicken, stalkerish type of romance. The Story is about 12 people in the survival games, competing to be a god to replace Deus Ex Machina! But, Mainly the story has so many twists and turns, and your head will literally be spinning after almost every single episode because it will just keep you guessing after every episode ends. And it will very much keep you entertained until the show ends. [SPOILERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR] For some people that are confused with Yunos parents and her \"Killing herself\" Now Yunos parents I'm just taking a big big guess here. I'm guessing that they died from starvation or something, since they were locked in the cage by Yuno for quite sometime.... And, what some people are really confused about the yuno \"Killing herself\" now in the story it actually take place in the second cycle of the survival games. Yuno had won the first cycle and her wish was to go back in time to see yuki again (since he died in the first cycle). So, Yuno realized since she has now went back in time to the second cycle, there's going to be another copy of her in the second cycle. So, Pretty much she went to where the 1st yuno was and she killed her :'(. \
Characters 9/10: I loved every character! except for fucking Yuki......... Reasons why I didn't like Yuki was because, he was that type of main character that was a whimpy cock swishing, cum guzzling looser that had to depend on everyone almost the whole entire time. But you have to really think around the bush when you think about Yuki. Things you have to think about Yuki is that the kid is only a 14 year old kid being thrown into the battle royal, and don't lie! If you guys were in a battle royal at the age of 14, we would all be shitting our selves, trying to find the easy way out.  At times that can get pretty annoying but, towards the end Yuki really does begins to change, And the same goes for a couple other characters in the story. Yuno, My baby momma, My favorite character! Cute, psychotic, probably really good in bed when I think about it, but let me get not off track..... YES, SHE WAS FUCKING PSYCHO AS FUCK AND WANTED TO KILL EVERY LIVING THING THAT TOUCHES YUKI. But! a side of me really thinks that she isn't really all that crazy. I think with her foster parents treating her like dumpster shit, and her getting into the survival games made her the way she was. Because when you saw some flashbacks she actually really looked like a really nice girl, and you couldn't really see that crazy/psycho side of her. But, that's why I love yuno because, she can be a sweet girl, she can be nice and she can be sensitive but, if you get on her bad side and try to take that yuki butt....... your ass is grass cuz.\
Art 7/10 : Meh, I've seen better! Not gonna lie but, I really didn't pay much attention to it since I was so into the show. It was nothing that special to go like \"holy fuckin shit this is spectacular art\" But, I can say is the art kind of reminded me of elfin lied a little bit with all of the blood and gore, and peoples heads coming off, and arms coming off.\
\
Sound 8/10: BOY I TELL YOU! The first opening song was on fucking replay when I finished the show! When they changed the opening at episode 15 (I think It was 15) I was a really disappointed but, you have to expect that from a 26 episode series at a certain point they will change the opener and the ending song. \
Enjoyment 10/10: Once read the plot of the show, I knew that I would instantly enjoy the show to a point where I would finished the show only 2 days.\
[MINI SPOILER]\
Overall 10/10: Mirai Nikki is going in my top 10 most favorites by far! still till this day my mind is still fucked up by the police finding the bones of Yunos parents and also the first cycle yuno ( You all will find this hilarious, at first I was feeling really smart as fuck and I thought the 3rd dead body was Wakaba (Yukis first crush). But then they said in a couple episodes later that it was actually Yunos body LOLLLLLLLLLL)\

    I recently watched Mirai Nikki and found it amazing!\
The series is basically about 12 people who are chosen by the God of the world, Deus. He is dying and in order to restore the world, there needs to be a new God. So, these 12 people are chosen and whoever remains (they have to kill each other) becomes the God. They are each given a diary that specializes in something to help. If you break the diary, you kill the player. The main character, Yukki or Yukiteru never wanted to be included in this game, and is scared the entire time. However, thanks to Yuno,\
          \
        his yandere, he seems to be surviving.\
The story in this anime is fantastic. It's very gripping, which is what you want in a horror anime. You always are looking forward to the next episode. Some things I have to say about it is that there are some very adult themes, like rape, and, of course, murder. Also, the end has a major plot twist, making you rethink a scene you probably wouldn't think about. The very end of this anime sucks, but everything else is fantastic so don't skip this anime just because of the sucky ending.\
For new anime viewers: I would recommend holding off on this series and trying something else. It's a bit complicated, and the horror aspect might make you be scared to watch any more anime.\
The voice acting is pretty good, I loved everyone's voice in the series except Yuno's got a little annoying at the end with all the \"Yukki\" in the series. But, what else can you expect from a yandere? The soundtrack is excellent and I sometimes listen to it for fun.\
The art is a little old fashioned, but it fits the series. It doesn't really have bright colors, and there isn't a cute side to the art at all, except for maybe the amusement park episode. It has a good amount of blood in it. It doesn't show guts like in Corpse Party (if you've ever seen that) which I am thankful for, because that much gore had me pretty freaked out.\
The character development is excellent, for the most part. A lot of characters die, hence the horror title. I was happy with the back story of Yuno, even though it was a bit confusing. The only character I was disappointed with was Yukki because he was a coward, then he got to be scary, then he went back to cowardly. \
Overall, I really like Mirai Nikki and I have rewatched some episodes (all the ones with Akise XD). I would recommend this for at least people that are 13 just because the horror is kind of scary.  \

The characters all have their perks and some I disliked at the beginning but they somehow made my love them at the very end, however, some still don't like hahaha but they can't change that now they... But I'm sure there is a character in this series you'll love or\

    Let me be honest.\
I was very disappointed when I watched Mirai Nikki.\
One might say: \"But, the anime is so good!\"  \
That's exactly why I am disappointed. I was disappointed that I have been holding back, trying not to watch Mirai Nikki. I am very disappointed in my long-term skepticism that made me think Mirai Nikki was nothing good. Then I read a review of the manga by a friend... online friend and said it was good. That made me gather up all doubt and throw it all away, and finally watched the anime. Going on by the public bandwagons that it is good, well,\
          \
        it is very good and you will enjoy from it. Trust me.\
The power to see, well, read the future, stalk someone, plan an impromptu escape route, or even solving cases by already figuring out the criminal right after he made him crime. Having that would surely interest many of us. Especially when you have an opportunity to become God, although blasphemous, is something too good to be true. If it were me, I'll try to turn back time or change history. But even so, imagining trying to become God is too blasphemous in itself.\
The story of Mirai Nikki centers around Amano Yukiteru, a boy who seems unsocial and made himself an observer, noting random things happening around him in his cellphone diary. He was satisfied by that lifestyle. He seemed to have an imaginary friend, a god made by his mind, named Deus Ex Machina. Then one day, he discovers that his cellphone held the power to read the future and automatically update his cellphone diary, even without writing anything in it. Then he meets Gasai Yuno, and the story begins.\
The story was fantastic, nerve-thrilling, exciting and overall, EXCELLENT, although I didn't prefer the lots of casualties within. The story was also quite easy to understand, viewing it in my point. Lots of action scenes, gunfighting, tear-jerking events, drama scenes and betrayals was so excellently executed and well-articulated it multiplies the overall greatness you expected, are expecting and will be expecting.\
The arts and designs were great. Again, the art created and utilized in killing scenes, in battle scenes and drama scenes were absolutely great. I found the execution of these scenes excellent. Speaking of excellent, seeing the bodies of the characters was also great. Nice Job! Hehehe.\
The character designs that went with it was also satisfying and at the same time, mildly stimulating. Wait, did I just say that? Forget it. NOW. But nevertheless, the designs I saw was so great and excellent that I am running out of synonymous words to say. Sorry for the inconvenience.\
The music and the OSTs were truly great. It blended so well and it perfectly portrayed what was going on about the story. A mix of thrillers, of some comedic routines, and not to mention, the music used with THOSE dramatic scenes. To be honest, I cried a bit after the death of the number √49. (Not the actual number, for non-spoiler purposes, although I think that has a bit of spoiler in itself.) Then there's THOSE OPs and EDs. First was a mix of languages, Latin (I think) Japanese ans German. Then the second one was fully English. And many more. All were excellent.\
The characters were also unique. All 12 (technically Root 169) participants of the game were great, with each one had distinct personalities that differed them. The First, Yukiteru, and other succeeding numbers, as well as the supporting characters was great, although I had to familiarize all, for there are many. My personal favorite, √81, (Not the actual number, for non-spoiler purposes, although I think that has a bit of spoiler in itself) is one of the best characters is encountered in my whole time of watching anime. Trust me, I'll think you'll like him/her if you watched it. I'll just have something to say. EASTERN ISLAND...WHY DID YOU TAKE MY FAVORITE CHARACTER AWAY??? NOOO!! Let's move on before my review turns into a swear article.\
Reading the review will make you notice something. I totally enjoyed my time watching Miari Nikki as well as disappointed for my skepticism. Mixed emotions like horror, fear, excitement and relaxation I got makes it truly more exciting.\
Overall, the anime was stupendously supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Great art, wonderful story, absolutely exciting, stimulating designs and animation, and the ending was also highly satisfying. Truly amazing. Overall excellency is 100%. This is one of the few anime I will want to rate 11, but couldn't. Naturally, I will recommend this to people that are fans of gore, competiton, gods, yanderes and time travel. I'm really sure you'll grow to like it.\
A simple afterword.\
I honestly think that my reviews are kind of...well...improper and sometimes biased. I know that many people have various preferences and my reviews have too much unnecessary in-between quotes and lines, but don't mind me. It is my way of writing. In my point, I loved Mirai Nikki even if I am not really a fan of animes of the same genre.",

    After a long stream of random wacky light hearted anime, I finally get to one of the animes on my list for a while, \"The Future Diary\". This anime goes way beyond what I expected from it *cough* which was rather lacking *cough*. Now before reading this review please note that there will be a couple spoilers ahead, and but by all means enjoy reading or flaming my two cents on Mirai Nikki.\
The story follows the average script with a psychological twist through the entire thing. I won't touch on the plot too much because you guys have a synopsis for that. Simply put that\
          \
        12 people who posses diaries that have been previously recorded with future events stirs up trouble in the everyday life of the protagonist, Amano Yukiteru. Now each character are somewhat over the top, but I'll touch on that more in my characters section. Throughout the anime, the story has a unpredictable path that is constantly taking sharp turns left and right. Some may say it's bad, some may say it keeps it exciting. In my opinion it's fine, not good) but messy. Shock value sets the center stage of this anime where everything has to be exciting. The last couple of episodes really puts the cherry on top. It raised a lot of questions, but had a satisfying conclusion...? Nope. SPOILERS All the character's futures were changed for the better. You can see how each and every diary owner was intertwined with another. Yukiteru's existence in the remnants of the second world was rather unnecessary. Sure the third world is a world that everyone can enjoy (even third world Yuki), but the clip after the final ED was even more unnecessary. Final note; in the third world, who will become the successor of Deus Ex Machina as his death is inevitable?\
Mirai Nikki features lots of beautiful scenes with action and scenery. Especially in the world Deus Ex Machina resides in. Throughout the anime I really enjoyed seeing how they set lightning in the various scenes. Nothing much to say here besides the animation was beautifully fluid with no parts that make me feel like punching the computer screen.\
Sound is one of the most important things in a horror genre title besides shock value. The OPs and EDs were enjoyable but still not the kinds that I won't skip. The anime doesn't really incorporate sound too often to build tension, but nothing is out of place.\
The characters, like i said, were all over the top (minus the first and eight diary owners). Which isn't a bad thing. Each character besides the main ones were given shoddy backstory to give them at least some sort of motive to play a part in this survival game anime. Now in my opinion, it's in the nature of these types of anime that don't follow a steady plot to have these types of throw away characters. Now for the main characters. Yukiteru remains his wimpy throughout most of the anime. Although he is wimpy, he will forgive anyone important enough to him for any reason. Yuno Gasai has the most detailed background of this story. Her live(s) revolve around Yukki's. She is nonsensical, nonnegotiable, and has an unrequited love for Yukki (until the end). Of course \"the perfect yandere\" that everyone knows. She has become too well known around the anime community.\
I'm a mindless anime watcher. I watched it. I enjoyed it.\
As for overall, I'm adding a bit so bear with me... a 9 *dramatic music plays*. I say give this anime a shot. If you like the shock value, a easy to follow story albeit not the greatest, and a sick and twisted love story then this is the anime for you! I really did enjoy watching this and I hope that you guys will put this on your list.\

    Warning: This review includes a description of the premise and first events within the anime (spoilers?) as well as questions regarding the story. Writing the review without it would have resulted impossible for me.\
Mirai Nikki is a story about two morons with the ability to -literally- read the future from their phones, who are showered day after day with an absurd amount of people who can also read the future and all are trying to kill him. One moron is extremely moronic, while the other one, a mere psychopath who wants to protect the extreme moron. The first one most of the time is a\
          \
        coward, physically weak, and mentally disabled by being neither wise nor smart. Essentially being, you know, an extreme moron. The only thing he has going for him is being extremely lucky and good at throwing darts (or is he lucky at it? It was never clear what it was). Even though the psychopath is yandere towards the extreme moron and also, you know, a psychopath, her smarts save the two characters' asses every god dammed time.\
Mirai Nikki was such a huge let down. For starters, the music is far from good. The drawing is casual at best. And the story is squeezed at parts where it needs pause for character development.\
Even though all these 12 people, who can -literally- read the future, are complete estrangers, they all start meeting with each other since day one, and the meetings never stop! A complete disconnect from reality! Sure, “this is an anime” you say, but the story is set in the real world with the premise as a plot twist to reality. Therefore the only thing to change reality should be their ability to read the future. How is that even enough to find each other, and so many, from day 1? At the end of each episode they try to explain how this happens, but it still falls short (for example: How have the corpses at Yuno’s house not been discovered (just the smell of the rotting bodies with her away to the neighbors!)? how did 12th know about 9th? How could 12th even walk being blind? How did Yuno know 12th was blind (Oh wow she is so smart! Right? Wrong. Smartness that equal to guessing correctly without a clue.)? How did 9th know and find Extreme-Moron so easily since at best she only knew about 3rd’s homicides (school gossiping about his new weird actions can be hardly be a reason for it)? And the list goes on…)\
Each character at best is given 30 seconds to 1 minute of character development as well as an explanation to their past, which is barely enough to understand them and side with them at all. Alright, fine, so 10 out of those people are secondary characters, but what about the main characters? The protagonist is introduced to be a completely loser and the author(s) hardly even try to give us a single quality about him with which to cheer for him! “Ooh! Big deal he is compassionate! He doesn’t play by the rules and thus he is special!” but how in the fuck does this TROPE help at all when the scenario at which they are at is a Hunger-Games-esque one of kill or be killed. At least in the Hunger Games Katniss was smart and actively sought ways to win (survive) while being a good person. Here Extreme-Moron doesn’t even seem to want to live, and unlike Kaneki from Tokyo Ghoul, even by episode 5 he is still the same complete moron with little to no sign of character progression. Once here and there he shows courage, but those actions rather just feel like a drag on the necessity for him to take action, after most of the job has been done by his psychotic girlfriend.\
I haven’t finished the series but I can foresee the tone won’t change much. I came hoping for a cat-and-mouse and contest-of-smarts anime like Death Note or Erased, but here I am watching a burlesque display of how 12 people meet and kill each other, both under the unlikeliest circumstances ever, effectively making me suffer disbelief, and thus not taking the story seriously, which in turn causes complete disconnect and rage for wasting my time on it. I suppose it's my fault for expecting it to be more than it actually was. I suppose I will finish it since I always try to finish what I watch, and additionally only thing it seems to do right is to always end in a cliffhanger. Still, I cannot help but to think “Such an amazing premise, such a horrible delivery.”",

    Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) is a touching, but awesome anime.\
The story starts with a 14 year old boy, named Yukiteru Amano. He is very anti-social and spends most of his time on his phone, writing a diary. But he's not THAT alone.. Yukiteru has imaginary friends in his mind, one named Dues, who is the ruler of everything. One day, he wakes from a nap, to find that everything that will happen is written in his phone diary. Everything adds up together. Soon, he is told that he is a survival game, that there are 12 diary users, and that he has to fight them,\
          \
        and that the last one standing will be god, in place of Dues. They have 90 days to fight each other, before the world ends.\
Yuki later runs into a strange character named Yuno Gasai, who will do anything and everything to protect Yuki. Yuno was always in the shadows, watching Yuki from afar, but when she discovers that he has a diary too, she confronts him, and never leaves his side..\

    Amazing! Although there are some detailed things that raises a question mark, the whole part of the story is a perfect anime. Elements of \"diary which can predict the future\" not only gives a different dimension to the theme of survival game that has been frequently used, but also produce a story that is completely new and unique. In other words, the diary is not just to be a weapon for the character, but also at the core story of the anime itself. Storytellingnya build a story of mystery to suspense carefully so that each episode was definitely the stairs to the climax. Tension and\
          \
        curiosity of the audience nurtured little by little and the right amount so that every fight is better than the previous fight but remained until beyond the next battle. However, for those who pay attention to detail a story would probably question the logical value of this anime. Watched a five year old child carrying syringes set traps toxic and poisonous gas, or two high school students who massacred people with MP5 machine guns, was more likely to surprise than creepy. This is not about their psychology, but rather about whether they might get dangerous objects like that so easily.\

    This anime is for any Battle Royal type of fans who enjoy death, destruction, and a race to become God. The story of Mirai Nikki was full of action, drama, death, suspense and thrill. The plot had us wanting to watch the next episode immediately to see what would come next, along with throwing in many red herrings to set us off. With a surprising and crazy twist, the plot had us shook. The overall art was half decent, but the smooth animation in fight scenes was very well done. The overall soundtrack was alright, but the opening was one of the best. Although, the\
          \
        BGM contrasted well with the happier scenes compared to the ones filled with despair and dread. The main character is very hard to enjoy watching for the majority of the beginning. You're mainly focused on the female heroine. But throughout the series, there is a clear development in the mindset of the main character. This finishes with a much more satisfying and tolerable personality by the end. Our overall enjoyment was outstanding because of the complexity of the plot and great character development. We would recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys an action-packed thriller with a surprising twist.\

    Overview:\
\"This is insanity. There's just no other word for it.\"\
Actually, \"Mirai Nikki\" can be described using many words- insane, bonkers, violent, twisted, shocking, strange, odd, weird.... and I'd say there are many more words along those lines that can be used to sum up this series. Simply put, this is one of the craziest anime I have yet to see. The characters are larger than life, the action is fast and suspenseful, the story is absolutely crazy, set pieces are brilliantly creative and the series throughout is pretty damn enjoyable.\
Story (9/10):\
That line above comes from our male protagonist Yukiteru Amano, a shy, introverted young boy\
          \
        who spends almost all his time writing a diary in his cellphone and talking to his imaginary friend, Deus Ex Machina, the God of Space and Time. However, he soon discovers that Deus isn't as imaginary as he once thought and that he, having been granted the ability to see the future through his diary, is one of 12 chosen candidates to inherit the Throne of Time as Deus is going to die soon and needs a successor. These people are forced to compete in a Survival Game where they have to hunt down and kill each other and the last man standing will become the next God.\
Now, Yuki is completely blown away by the whole thing, and not in a good way, having no desire to win. Unfortunately for him, he is Deus's favourite to win, and therefore the primary target of all the other Diary Users. He needs help, and thankfully he gets some in the form of the main female protagonist, Yuno Gasai. The catch is that this girl is a seriously unstable psychopath who has been stalking him for a year and has an obsessive crush on him, to the point that she's willing to kill anyone who could possibly get in the way of the two of them being together.\
The amount of suspense in this series is colossal, as any person who gets close to Yuki could potentially be trying to kill him, which makes Yuno, whether he likes or not, the only person he can truly count on. There's also a huge number of twists as well, though some may be a bit too crazy for some people. There are also occasional moments where the fast pacing breaks, having some really comical parts after a really disturbing episode, which may and have put off some people. If you can get past these, however, you will be rewarded with a brilliant, unique story that will leave you guessing to the very end.\
Art & Animation (8.5/10):\
Visually, \"Mirai Nikki\" looks very good. While there are certainly better looking anime in this decade, all the characters are well-drawn and things always run very smoothly. Special mention has got to go to Deus, who despite being a tower-high CGI-esque being still manages to fit brilliantly with the rest of the animation. The effects when the Future Diaries rewrite themselves are really good as well, among other things.\
Sound & Dialogue (9.5/10):\
\"Mirai Nikki\"'s soundtrack isn't the best around, but it still gets the job done and really fits the tone of the show. The opening and ending themes are brilliant, especially the ending themes. The voice acting is really good as well. Even those who didn't like the dub still agree that Kent Williams' performance as Deus is godly (no pun intended), and I'm one who really liked the dub. Brina Palencia does an awesome job as Yuno, being able to switch her voice from normal to psychotic within seconds. If anything, she sure knows how to pull off an angry scream. Josh Grelle also has an impressive range as Yukiteru. I especially liked his calm voice, which really fitted Yuki in the latter half of the series.\
Characters (9/10):\
\"Mirai Nikki\" has a brilliant cast of characters, which is saying something considering about 90% of them are villains. Yukiteru tends to be a very controversial character among fans. There are some who hate him for being weak and cowardly, while there are others who consider him a relatable and sympathetic character who reacts realistically to the situation he's been pulled into. I agree with the latter party. I mean, try being a socially awkward 14-year-old boy who is forced to compete in a deathmatch filled with psychopaths. And the only person you can trust is the crazy Yandere who is insanely in love with you for reasons you can't figure out. He most certainly grows a spine as well and the badass upgrade is absolutely awesome.\
You know this is a messed up world when the crazy stalker is one of the more sympathetic characters. Honestly, you sometimes think that it's actually the world that's insane rather than Yuno. Compared to the actual villains in the series, Yuno really isn't that bad, as she's one of the few characters looking out for anyone other than herself. Therefore, I consider her an anti-hero, if a very, very dark one. That may seem hard to believe considering some of the things she does, but believe me when I say she has a very good reason for her obsession with Yukiteru. She has a truly horrible past and when you learn it, you will be screaming at Yuki for him to give her a hug. Also believe me when I say that, however, obsessive it may be, her love for Yuki is genuine. She's many things, but she's not a hypocrite. Besides that, she manages to be both really cute and really scary, often at the exact same time! Seriously, I don't know how they managed to pull that off but they did and the results are captivating. In short, she is a really compelling, unpredictable and truly awesome character and not only is she my favourite character in the series by far, she's one of my favourite anime characters, full stop, which is saying a lot as I usually don't like psychopaths at all. Then again, I guess that just goes to show how unique she is.\
It's hard to talk about the other characters without spoiling something but I will say that they are very good with a few exceptions. I will say, however, that the Diaries' abilities serve as a reflection of the personalities of their owners. Yuki's Diary, for example, tells him everything about his whereabouts but nothing about what happens to him, while Yuno's Diary keeps her updated on whatever Yuki's doing 24/7, essentially making it the ultimate staking tool. This adds another layer to the suspense, as Yuki and Yuno must not only figure out who the other Diary Users are, but also what aspect of the future their Diaries hold in order to defeat them.\
Another interesting aspect is that the show also goes out of its way to show just how unfit some people are to be parents, as nearly all of the characters are or were forced to deal with some kind of abuse or abandonment by the people who were supposed to be taking care of them. The best parents seem to be the ones who died before they could turn into horrible people. This does a brilliant job at developing the various characters and teaches us a sad yet valuable lesson about life.\
Enjoyment (9.5/10):\
\"Mirai Nikki\" had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. It never stopped trying to shock me to the point that I hardly had any breath in my lungs. And I love it for that. It never got to the point of being predictable and I was always ready for more. To be really satisfied, however, you will have to watch the OVA, \"Mirai Nikki: Redial\", as the anime itself unfortunately has a pretty ambiguous ending that will only make sense if you watch the OVA. Some may also find the concept to be too ridiculous so if you don't like anime, you probably won't like this. If you manage to make it through the first time, however, it is definitely worth watching a second time as it casts multiple characters in a different light and you can learn things you may have missed the first time around.\
Overall:\
This is an absolutely awesome series and I am proud to say I had a fantastic time watching it. It's an absurd, unique and highly suspenseful roller-coaster ride that will keep you wondering what the hell is going on and your patience will almost certainly be rewarded. If nothing else, you should at least watch it for its tragic, badass and oh so adorable Yandere Queen. If you're looking for something that will blow your mind, look no further than \"Mirai Nikki\".\

    Mirai Nikki. After finishing all 26 episodes (and the OVA), I rate this 5/10. There will be some spoilers in this review.\
The openings and endings in the show, are nothing overly impressive. Although the first opening to the show (Kuusou Mesorogiwi) absolutely astounded me, the second opening (Dead End) wasn't as impressive and sounded similar to a lot of other openings. I found both endings forgetful and unimpressive. I liked the old sound, like a gramophone, at the start of the second ending. However, I was only impressed by the first five seconds before the gramophone sound disappeared. The rest of the ending was almost\
          \
        identical to Kuusou Mesorogiwi, however not as catchy or interesting. However, I'll admit that the OST is interesting compared to most of the horror genre. It explores various themes, whilst many are still memorable. It fails to stick into one genre, which is a plus in my opinion. You never know what you're going to expect with it, that's what makes it so memorable to me.\
The characters are my main problem with this show. I couldn't connect with Yuki or Yuno. In fact, Yuno's obsession over Yuki was annoying rather than cute. Yuno felt more like fan service than an actual strong character. The only reason Yuno was such a memorable character, was because of her yandere personality. Out of all the characters, I found that the diary users (apart from Fourth, Yuno and Yuki) were the most interesting. The death of Third was too abrupt and I would have preferred the show if it went into more detail surrounding him. Eighth was the biggest let down character wise. She appeared as a kind-hearted woman and I would have loved to see more of the story based around her. However, I did take an interest in Ninth (Minene) and liked how she became more of a main character near the end. She acted the most humanly out of all 12 diary users. At the beginning, I assumed she would be the conventional crazy antagonist with pigtail and the cliche dress and voice. However, as the series progresses, you begin to understand more about Minene and how she is anything but the crazy girl cliche.\
The plot, where do I start? The first thing I noticed about the show, was how promising the plot seemed from the synopsis. However, the plot had too many holes. One minute the parents were having a fight (for no reason), the next thing we know, the mum's dead. It was too sudden to have any sort of affect and it felt like she had died just for the sake of someone dying. Another fault in the plot, was it's use of unnecessary episodes. Episodes 8, 9 and 10 had no affect on the main plot at all. They had a problem, it got resolved, they carried on killing other diary users after. However, there were some decent points in the plot, which I thought were interesting and engaging. I liked how they decided to flip the story on its head in the last quarter of the show. I was comfortable with the plot, I knew where it was going and didn't see any twists. Although I was correct for the majority of the show, the last quarter in no doubt surprised me a lot. I could never have guessed quite how the story ended up, even if it wasn't exactly satisfactory. Overall, the plot had too many holes, was dragged out for too long, only became interesting nearer to the end, and was a huge mess. \

    An amusing plot on it's own right.  However i did in fact have issues with the characters.  Every writer knows that the characters are the most important aspect in any work of fiction.  I chose 9th as my favorite because was to me, by far the best written character.  When you try to write a character that is suffering, there is a line that goes from enduring the pain and trying to do what is right, or just being a bitch the entire time.   Yuki was the latter character.  It seemed that every time he seemed to make\
          \
        some progress into development.  It was a thee steps forward, and then 5 steps back.  I have the feeling that this show would have been a lot better off if it was just left at about a 12 episode length, Most psychological/ thriller genres are supposed to be a bit messy, but then everything gets sorted out in the end with thorough explanations.  However every time this show tried to explain something, they did a pretty crappy job, which in all fairness just frustrated me and i would have less frustrated just being in the dark.  \
This was not my favorite of it's genre and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone.\

    I thought the beginning of the series was the best because it was'nt to much weird stuff happening and it was fun to watch and i really loved it but then when it came to the episodes 20-25 it was boring. The last episode really made things clear and i like that but in the middle there was alot of confusion and myself got so annoyed alot of times because of Yukiteru, the main character.\
I dont want to leave any spoilers so this review might be kind of bad and not really saying much. But to sum it up, i liked the beginning much more\

    I finished this anime and boy was I happy. I'm gonna be honest, Mirai Nikki had a good story going when I watched the first episode. Actually this was my first time watching an anime with a yandere character, so I was a little skeptical on how it would turn out...and well...let's just say...I'm sad that I wasted a lot of time on it. To be blunt, Mirai Nikki is garbage. \
I liked the idea of having the MC as a character that isn't strong or ''cool'' because those can get pretty boring/annoying ya know? But with the MC in Mirai Nikki, I almost was\
          \
        with the all ''enemies'' sides on this one. Kill this weak and whining bastard. I get it, the writer is trying to make him..less..cliche..or what you'd normally expect. But Yuki is nothing but a whining baby. Literally, throughout the entire anime (except maybe the last few episodes) he just has Yuno protecting him. It's quite a pitful sight. I could see if he manned up by the middle of the anime, but I had to wait until the VERY END for that boy to realize that he's got to fight SOMETIME within the game. That being said, the fight scenes include literally nothing but Yuki crying to Yuno on how she shouldn't kill recklessly, and Yuno saying ''It's okay Yuki...I'll protect you''. Honestly the only reason I gave this anime a 6 was for the the side characters because I was mainly annoyed with our main pair. \
I even remember me dropping this anime for a while, only because I was thoroughly annoyed and thought I wouldn't be able to finish it. But like I mentioned earlier, if it weren't for the side characters, I wouldn't of been able to finish it...and I have to say they weren't any good either. It was tough trying to feel sorry for their deaths when I barley knew them. I didn't care about them at all to be honest. I just wanted to watch them torture Yuki.\
Art was okay, nothing really stood out to me. \
Music was...eh. I did appreciate the openings, but other then that I was too twisted on the horrible characters I didn't have time to even listen to the soundtracks.\
Overall, if you want to watch this anime don't wast your time unless you get a kick out of yandere and whining boys. That's literally all I got out of it.-senpai \

    Overall a very strange show, with alot of missed potential.  \
To start off the art style is pretty standard with no really stand out moments, there's a little bit of CG mixed in there but its hardly of any concern.  The music during the show is pretty forgettable but serves its purpose, however the opening and ending themes really are quite good and have some interesting visuals.  \
Now the characters of the show are a big problem.  Yuno, the crazy pink haired chick that this show is known for, is really the only driving force when it comes to real character\
          \
        development.  Minene helps a little too but the rest of the characters come of as very flat and static, however I gave characters such a low score because of the male lead.  'Yuki' as Yuno calls him is a sad little man who's personality and motivations seem to change as often as the damn tide.  Sometimes he's brave, sometimes he's a wimp, sometimes he's a high functioning sociopath and sometimes he's thicker than the great wall of china.\
Now the story starts off well and the premise is interesting, but I feel like during the story board for each episode Billy Mays dropped into the studios proclaiming \"But Wait! There's more!\" because mechanics and rules keep getting added on all the way up until the very end, and it is seriously ridiculous.  By the end of the show the plot bites the bullet in a matter of speaking and really plummets.  \
Basic Idea: A group of 12 people (but a guarantee you this isn't even a sold rule in itself) are all given phones with the ability to read into the future, each phone is catered for the personality of each contestant.  These contestants must have a battle royal in order to determine who will be the next god of this universe, last one left standing gets the job.  Now being as the current god (Deus, no not Ex Machina, but he might as well be) is on a time crunch he and his assistant stur up the cometition in order to hurry things along and make them interesting.\

    Where do I begin? Before watching this, I did my usual background research over this show to see if it was worth watching. I started this show with mixed feelings, I was excited to indulge in a enticing premise involving future diaries, but at the same time I was sceptical because of all the poor reviews that the show received. BUT, I'm thankful that I managed to overlook the fact that the show was not all that well-received and still carried on with it. In return, I was rewarded with a beautiful story. \
I shall first start with the bad points of the show, and\
          \
        the reason why many dislike it. The execution of the story isn't done very well, with the plot being rushed at some points in time and becoming too slow at the next, there also isn't as much suspense as there should be for a mystery thriller genre. The story itself is also filled with too many disconnected story arcs that makes it feel as though you're watching many sub stories instead of one as a whole. As for the characters, I personally found all characters to be pretty too over the top and extreme and only took fancy to Yuno, Akise, and Minene. Character development definitely wasn't this anime's strong point, with pretty big personality inconsistency with the two mains (although personally I found them to be justifiable). \
HOWEVER, I was still able to enjoy myself throughout the course of watching this anime because the ending is spectacular. Without revealing too much, I just want to mention that nearing the ending episodes, things start to go a little crazy and just when you think you know what will happen next, the most unexpected of things happen. With one of the CRAZIEST plot twists, and some unexpected themes that are a personal favourite of mine, I can't help but love this anime for it. The romance in this anime, although extremely unconventional because Yuno is a yandere, was still nice to root for as it progressed and Yuki began to have a change in his feelings for Yuno. \
Adding on, I really enjoyed the art and music for this, with one of the most beautiful pieces of instrumental piano in touching moments, it really adds to the tenderness of the scenes, giving them more FEELS! It really depends on a personal level whether or not you will enjoy this anime. If you're someone that has an extremely keen eye for details or plot holes, then perhaps you would be too bothered by the bad parts of Mirai Nikki to enjoy it. But if you're looking for a compelling story, go ahead and watch it! \

Love it, so good. It just surpasses all expectations!The story was above average and the characters while not perfect fit the tale and brought me joy. (my favorite characters being 1st, 2nd, 9th and 12th) The voice acting and music were highly enjoyable. This show is a 10/10 on the enjoyment scale. This series contain a moment of literal Deus ex machina.\

    I have mixed feelings about this one. ~SPOILER WARNING~\
I was really excited for this anime and actually enjoyed it for a while. After the abduction, the enjoyment ended. It was like watching someone try to fit their entire wardrobe into one carry on suitcase and failing immensely. \
The story was so hard to follow that it was impossible for me to enjoy it. Near the end when the time capsule/travel or whatever started happening, I couldn't stop laughing. It was so awful. I had to watch those last few episodes to fully understand them. Even then I didn't have a clue. I seriously think that\
          \
        they couldn't make up their mind and tried to fit everything in.\
The art was good. Not too bad, not drop dead gorgeous though. I gave the art a seven just because their are some pretty cool shots and scenes that deserve some mention. \
I loved all the music. The openings and endings were awesome and worth enough not to skip. \
The characters were actually really good and I loved them all. Although, some of the characters got a little annoying. Not just because of the character themselves but because of the writing as well. I thought they were worth a rating of seven though. \
I didn't enjoy this anime that much when I got to the middle. I don't know exactly what episode but I got really irritated by the crowded story line. If it weren't for the story, I think I would've liked this anime a lot more and rated it a lot higher.\
Overall I gave this anime a four. I can see how some people can enjoy this anime and give it a much higher score like a 9 or whatever but in my opinion, it was only worth a four. Maybe even a three.\

    first off the story is pretty interesting, it isn't something i've seen before. concept was pretty interesting but the story has some plotholes like i still don't get why yuno wants the kill yukki??\
the art is quite good but not something to wow at\
the soundtrack is the salvation of the show, mirai nikki has some of the best emotional osts i'm not even kidding.\
where do i begin with the character. when you first start off the show, it would seem that Yuno is a really smart girl and just obsessed with yukki which might gain your liking but as the show progresses she gets really\
          \
        fked up to the point you don't know wheter you love her or hate her anymore. Yukki is such a wuss in the beginning like i would understand after all this sudden shit he has to go through but after awhile it just gets annoying and suddenly he does a total 180 degree charactee flip & suddenly becomes this killing machine, it's abit unrealistic like no one just sudden has this character switch that goes off. not just that, at the end he's literally manipulated many times by Yuno but is still like i love yuno even though she just tried to kill me, okay actually i would give him credit that he still decides to go for Yuno and leave behind his dream world but after becoming god, you do nothing for ten thousand years??? seriously?? the only salvation in the characters is the Ninth & Akise, they're my favourite characters in the story and it was nice to see Ninth have a happy ending with Nishijima :-) \
The enjoyment level was alright, it was quite intense so it didn't make me feel like giving the anime up. but at the same time, you're just like what the fk is wrong with this character, this anime is so fked up?? but little bit of happiness you get at the ova is kinda good cause it shows everyone happy & not dead & getting what they want & all the couples you ship get together & everyone ends up together nice and happy :-)\

    By far this will be one of my top three anime for a long time. I love Yuno. This story has such a great survival game story in my opinion. Characters development is good. If you haven't seen this anime I would recommend this to most people. Unless you hate gore, guns, basically anything that horror movies would have then no. I currently own this show on DVD. So I do watch this show over and over again when I get bored. there are some many things I talk about with this anime in mind. You could say I live around it.it changed my view\

    Plenty of spoilers here. This review will be rather short though, because the gaps IN THIS WHOLE ANIME are just too great to condense into a review. Yes, it's that bad.\
Don't get me wrong: I do love the whole psychological thriller genre. I was half expecting a maturely written storyline with amazing cast as in Psycho Pass. BUT WTF. NO. THIS ANIME DOES NOT EVEN COME CLOSE TO IT.\
If anything it annoyed the heck out of me and I just couldn't wait til I was over and done with this appalling 26-episode anime. EVERYTHING is wrong. Main characters are annoying, storyline makes no sense; I\
          \
        have NO IDEA HOW A FREAKING GOD CAN DIE. I do not know how a mortal can meet good and actually propose to him about Future Diaries and if the world had Hosen, we'll we'd be dead by now. But let's not get to the whole story line part. The part I hated the most was the character development. \
SOMEBODY PLEASE KILL YUKI ALREADY. And along with that get rid of that damn annoying Gasai Yuno along with him. YUKI WHY CAN'T YOU BLOODY MAKE UP YOUR MIND ON WHAT IT IS THAT YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO DO. What is your objective in this whole anime? He is soooo poorly written and inconsistent that I am appalled. Seriously. \
And well. That's the worst part of this anime. Sad, really. Considering how beautiful the art and the initial concept could actually be. Tsk.\

    Supremacy, Tragedy, Love, Survival. As far as im concerned, this is the way Mirai Nikki works, as something deceptive at the very start, yet psychologically grabbing, until we meet Deus Ex Machina, which is where the story begins. So where does this place in my heart? Well there is a lot I could say, but how about one word to start me off? Addiction.\
Story (9.3/10): The first episode should be enough to understand why its been rated well in this category, for not only does it stick to its manga roots, but the way it deceives you at the start and suddenly pulls you in\
          \
        is what makes this Story almost like a drug I cannot have enough of. Every plot twist was almost perfectly executed, and the amount of ways the director can make you believe something that turns out to be false is almost scary. The ending felt a bit slack though, hence the non-perfect rating.\
Art (9.4/10): Very consistent, and very crisp for the most part, Mirai Nikki is able to successfully depict a psychological thriller, as well as make characters show their inner personalities, whether shy or malicious. Especially when it comes to Yuno Gasai, I don't know a moment where the art fails to show how deeply terrifying and obsessive she can be.\
Sound (8.5/10): Ill be fair, the Opening Song for the first 13 episodes felt...cliche in terms of choir? Although the last 13 episode openers presented an edgier rock feel to it, which was far more catchy and listenable. Another successful part of Mirai nikki though is the ability for sound to appear only when needed, and you could say the lack of sound in some parts only made this even more interesting and thrilling in many areas in which sound would kill the mood entirely. Brava!\
Character/Enjoyment (18/20): Holy god Yuno, it is no wonder you are the queen of all Yanderes, for I have never felt intrigued yet so unable to predict such actions from anyone but you yet. Whether it is Tsubaki, or the weak yet mentally developing Yukiteru, there is hardly any criticism I could provide, for there is no-one that is static, and some of the backstories can easily shed a tear to your eyes, especially at the end of their journey.\
During this anime, I didn't know what to expect, even after I had read the manga volumes. But somehow, I was shocked by how true to the story it was, and how they managed to literally capture the dazzling essences of most of the characters. Some may call this a slasher, some may even call it a waste of time. St. Luminous Mission High School was a waste of time. This, is a work of Supernatural, Psychological Art that deserves acclaim (minus perhaps the abruptness in a certain place *cough*) 9.5/10, rounded to a 10. and a well deserved score at that.\

    Okay this is a series I have been looking forward to.  With the crazy Yuno being so Yandere for Yukki there is no way you could say that this wouldn't work as an anime.  Anyway Mirai Nikki is one of those series that you will have to watch twice to get the full meaning of what is going on.  with this the rewatch value goes up (I'm basing this on the manga as the anime isn't finished.)   \
With strong opening scenes which mean apsolutly nothing to anyone new to the series.  You can expect blood, romance (Crazy romance mind\
          \
        you.)  and a metric butt tonne of crazy people trying to off each other to become the new GOD of cause and effect (I believe thats what Deus is).  \
With the first Opening it starts a bit slow then punches you in the face saying \"HEY!!  KEEP WATCHING!!\"  and the first ending is the same.\
The down side is the second opening,  it seems to want people to get annoyed with Faylan as she clearly didn't do well in english classes (second opening is sang in english from start to finish...)  and the second ending is just meh.\
for a fan of the manga watch it as I have seen scenes which suggest no plot change, so its just the same but with the fights oh god the fights.\
Newcomers give it a chance.  Its still going but it will be an unending roller coaster just waiting for you to get on.\

    Warning beforehand Mirai Nikki is sort of a gory anime so if you have a weak stomach well then watch invite a bucket to accompany you.\
Story: The concept of a survival game with cellphones is not completely original but Mirai Nikki does have these few creative twitches that makes up for it. The story itself can be a bit confusing especially towards to end but the general idea is to kill and win since it is a survival game after all. Except one problem Yuki is weak and yes a bit well ALOT of a coward. The story revolves around him and Yuno depending on\
          \
        each other more sort of Yuki depending on Yuno though. There's sabotage, sacrifice, love, betrayal and at parts have you wanting to lock all of your windows and hide under your bed. This anime seriously plays with your mind sometimes though it's all worth it.\
Art: The art is pretty good. Not horrible, not amazing. The author did do a good job on drawing Yuki and Yuno. Just looking at Yuki you can already tell how much of a coward he is. As for Yuno i think it perfectly fits her personality her bright pink hair in piggy tails really makes her look just like one of the moe characters in anime ... this is the part where you sorta think back and question your existence. LOL.\
Sound: I loved the opening themes and the second ending theme was amazing. The lyrics generally fits the theme though sound wise it sorta reminds me of Greek opera. LOL not that its a bad thing I mean who doesn't love a little opera now and then. The music throughout the series do help set the mood like when there's a sad scene a pretty sad song will come on. I don't think the music is one of Mirai Nikki's strong point though.\
Character: Now this is definitely the best thing about Mirai Nikki. The characters are imo very well developed mainly focusing on Yuno and Yuki here. Though the other characters are very important too, you wouldn't believe how many characters in this series do not seem like how they are at first glance. Yuki who is weak (and has you shaking your head of how pathetic he is sometimes) and Yuno who is strong, smart and madly in love with Yuki. You'd think someone would be taken advantage of here though it might not be the person you had in mind.  Yuno is definitely the most interesting character for me theres so many words to describe her, bipolar, schizophrenic, psychopathic but to me shes like the yandere from heaven LOL though i doubt any yandere would be in heaven.\
Enjoyment: After the first episode i couldn't stop watching it. It may seem a bit ordinary at first but dont fall for it , its a trap lol the character development and interesting twists just keep you engaged and intrigued through the whole series.\
Overall: Overall I would give it a 10 just because i enjoyed it so much but even i must admit there are a few cliche scenes here and there. Im telling you if you want something suspenseful, thrilling, action packed, and psychological then ding ding ding we got a winner! LOL mirai nikki is the perfect anime for you. Enjoy the series if you decide to watch it oh and remember the bucket ;) \

    Mirai Nikki is a quite over hyped anime with a lot of different opinions. Because of this you have a higher change of totally disagreeing with me.\
Mirai Nikki Is a semi-horror survival game with a lot of action. Because it is horror we will be expecting some stuff. Violence, Scaryness and death. That's why I beforehand want to make sure you feel like watching this since this could be happening to sensitive people. Of course it's not like a horror movie and these factors are reduced by a significant amount.\
In Mirai Nikki there will be two main scenarios. Action/horror and a lot with relationships and\
          \
        mystery. Or what we call a passive and an active form. The passive form works on the psychological part that is really good on this anime. The action part will work more direct and you have deeper feeling with those moments. Since there is a lot of playing with feeling from you, you are sensitive for happy and unhappy moments in the anime. Making you cherish the good moments and be sad when something bad happens. This is done really well by Mirai Nikki. One of the greater parts of the anime.\
Story:\
The story on a horror anime most of the time focuses on introducing the situation and his characters and their goal in this situation. Since the explanation of the characters and their goals are done so well I really think that the story is great. Tough the real events taking place with overdone actions is a bummer. But anyway the story is good at his own way. (8/10)\
Art:\
The art in Mirai Nikki is focusing on the action parts and lack in his work in parts that don't take an active role. But since there is most of the time is action we don't see these things much. The art looks modern and feels good with the horror genre. Blood and details on weapons are done well and makes it feel more realistic. (9/10)\
Sound:\
The sound pack of Mirai Nikki is insane and the voice acting is really good. Tough the background sound kind of lacking, but you won't really notice them to much since they're not that important. The themes are really good and fitting the anime right. (9/10)\
Character:\
The character design of Mirai Nikki is good, but has mistakes. Like we don't know much about Yuno and the friends of Yukki, but we know everything about the Main characters in the course of the anime. The design is good and a lot of the characters are unique. Tough Yuno and Yukki have knot as unique style since it's really predictable on their reactions. Besides that still good. (8/10)\
Enjoyment:\
The enjoyment on this anime is really how you have feelings for the characters and you always have your tauts on what will be happening and your preferences. Because of this your enjoyment will be most of the time higher then usual animes where you'll be like: Let's see what will be happening. In Mirai Nikki you are over thinking thinks and like Dora trying to help them. Really good work on the enjoyment. (10/10)\
Overall:\
A horror anime with great work with the viewers and good art/sounds. (9/10)\
Recommended for: everybody besides people who do not like semi-horror.\

    This is the first review i've ever written, but i hope you'll like it anyway. \
Mirai Nikki is kind of a creepy love story about a broken person called Yuki. He doesn't have any friends in school, but does have some in his fantasy. He suddenly finds out that he's fantasy friends wasn't just an imagination, but actually was the god of the world. The god called Deus created a survival game where only the strongest player could survive and take over as god of the  new world. All the participants got their own future diary, and they had to use them to find\
          \
        and kill each other. When Yuki got his diary everything seemed to be going well until he suddenly talked to the most popular girl in school, Gasai Yuno. She was also a diary owner who had been stalking Yuki for years. She was always the one to save him and he was just about to fall in love with her, until he found out about her secret. \
Story: 10 \
Because the story was always so unpredictable and it kept the excitement throughout the whole show. It's actually the first show i've seen without a pause. It really kept my interest until the very end. There's so many happy, sad, romantic, exciting, interesting and unexpected moments where you can almost fall down from the chair. The story is actually very unique with lots of action and it's still keeping the romance in place. There did happend some ridiculous things through the show, but i kinda seem to like them anyway. I give it a top score because it is insane at all time, but still there was nothing that seemed to make me think about dropping it at all. \
Art: 10\
Well, what can i say? The quality of the whole show was really good, especially at the action scenes. I don't have anything to complain about it.\
Sound: 10\
The voice of the characters matches their character perfectly in sub, at first. The music in it was also really good. The opening song was very interesting and it really fit the show perfectly. The music at the actions scenes were really creepy actually, but the show is creepy at times, so i couldn't really complain about it. The music was well done, and well set up, and i enjoyed every moment of them. \
Character: 9 \
Now i'll just be taking the most important in the shows to me. \
Yuki's Character: He's a really weak and broken person, because he never learned to stand up of for himself. He cries alot through the show, which started to annoy me so badly. He's a naive little kid, who at first believed everything people tells him, fx when he was trying to save sixths. \
Spoiler:After his parents got killed he became a stronger and more interesting character. Yuno told him if he became god of the world he could bring his parents back. He started getting alot more into the game and had no problem killing after it. But when he suddenly got told that it was impossible even as a god bringing people back, he got all weak and twisted again.\
Yuno's Character: Yuno is/was my favourite person in the show. It was really enjoyable watching this cute girl kicking ass for real. She is such a sweet, but still hardcore and cold person to everyone but Yuki. You know from the start how much she loves Yuki and she had put her life in danger so many times to save him. She had a really bad childhood where he parents had locked her in in cage and that seemed to create the person she became. She has no problem killing people as long it's helping Yuki. She has this creepy side, because she is actaully a very overproctective person, who just wants Yuki to be happy and seem to have a hard time trusting other people. But Yuno's role through the show keeps changing between the bad guy and the hero. But to me she seemed mostly like the hero. \
Akise: Akise is one of Yuki's classmates who loves to investigate things. He was known in the class as the freak and didn't show up at school many times. At first when Akise showed up in the show, i actually believed that he was a bad guy, but then he seemed to be the one to save everybody, and was actually a quite good person and then again he seemed like the bad guy again. He was one of the most unpredictable characters in the show, and you never really knew where you had him. \
Ninth (Uryu Minene): She was one hell of a great character, who was a terroist, she arrived as the bad guy also in one of the first episodes and started bombing the whole school, but later she got very important in the show. She had the escape diary which helped her hiding from the police. She keeps showing up at good times and always gave a helping hand. She's a hardcore, strong and actually a good person deep inside with a very bad childhood. Also one of my favourite characters.\
There's of course alot more cool characters, but i did try to get the most important and my favourites in it.\
Enjoyment: 10\
I usually get tired of an anime really fast, but as i've said many times now it kept holding my interest through the show. There was so many special moments where i couldn't stop laughing, crying, getting angry and such. But it was so enjoyable and i could just re-watch it 20 times more. Really. \
Overall: 10 \
It was such an unique and exciting story, and i know that future diaries seems odd, but this really blew my mind. I'm so thankful for watching such a great anime and i would've loved everyone of you to have the same experience with the show as i had. \

    Alright so I write some pretty long reviews. I'll try to make it as spoiler free as possible too. So here we go:\
Story. \
I gave the story a 7 out of 10. That means that it's a great plot with some minor things I didn't like. I knew from the beginning that this was going to be the type of show where it pushes the limits. However I didn't know if it was going to push the limits the way that 80's rock did (wonderfully) or like Lady Gaga (wtf?). \
Most of the time the story pushed the limits in a good way. Most of\
          \
        the time. There were some moments where I felt that the writers put in moments to make the viewer squirm and not in the way that keeps the storyline going. And some moments that they added those factors in just ruined the mood that the scene had. \
There were also a few things I would have liked to see more progressed. However I love the ends that it tied together. Even if some of them left me going \"What what?\" None of my confusion was really bad in the end. I even really enjoyed the ending, but there is no way I can describe it without spoiling it, so I'll just let the future viewer decide how they feel. \
Art: \
I loved the art style in this show. There were a few moments with derp faces in the background or a cock eye or something, but nothing that I can really point out. I love that the mood is always there in the art style, whether it be a romantic moment or a drastic action moment. \
The fact that the style changes in a way so subtle you don't notice but so deeply that it can change the entirety of the situation tells you that they have some wonderful artists working on this project. There was very little wrong I could find in the art style. Why take off one point? Mainly the derp faces in the background and the fact that the version I saw had most of the gore blurred out so I can't judge on it. Sadface.\
Sound:\
The soundtrack for this show (not including EDs and OPs) was pretty. In all cases. It could have me on the edge of my seat and having goosebumps with the writing, or could have me saying \"Aawww!\" in the very next moment. I have to say, there was a couple I was rooting for in this series.\
I took off a point for the sound because the second season OP was terrible. It was such bad engrish that if not for the karaoke subs up top I wouldn't be able to understand it. The one time I did I thought I heard \"Will you kee yo freh if you can foofy you dree\" Wait what? Stop that. Speak japanese or GTFO. Both the endings and the first opening were pretty fantastic though. It takes a lot for a japanese song to get stuck in my head but that first opening did it for me.\
Characters: \
There are so many words I want to put into this section alone but I can sum it up with one. Wow. Okay maybe you need more words than that.\
The characters in this show are absolutely amazing. Each one has their own strengths and weaknesses, horrible backgrounds, and they don't skimp on the details at any time. I love each and every game character's story, even if I hate the story, I still love it. I love how they give so much depth to each and every person that you can love them, hate them, and love to hate them. But I can't think of a single person that I was only \"eh\" over.\
The fact that you can get so dedicated and so interested in these characters with this show tells me that the writers put a lot of effort into making this show wonderful and it paid off. I'd give a full summary of every character but I can't spoil it. Let me just say though, Yuno is a gorgeous rounded insanely amazing character. And Yukiteru is the most dynamic character I have ever seen in an anime. \
Enjoyment: \
The shock factor did take some of the points off on this, and the second opening, and there were some moments that I was really wanting to skip a scene just to see what happens because I was tired of (what I though) was filler. Let me just tell you, btw, if you think it's filler? It's not. Totally necessary every single freaking time. Remember everything.\
Because of the major issues with the shock factor I had to take off those points though, because I think that sometimes the writers just needed to know that some things were a little unecessary. But I only took a point and a half off for that. The other half was for that opening...uuugghh\
Overall: \
I gave this show a 9. Why? I averaged it up and rounded up. If I hate a show I average down, with this one I averaged up. Because I really enjoyed it. Even with the flaws it's still a show I would recommend to anyone that's looking for something after Higurashi especially. And I'm a big fan of survival game series. So I hope after reading this either you agree with me because you've already seen the show, or you decide that it sounds interesting enough and decide to watch it finally. It's pretty great, so enjoy. \

All these versatile genre's makes this anime really worth watching.  This anime has the coolest characters, epic scenes, best storyline possible.  If you enjoy watching anime then i give u my word that u would definitely enjoy this anime.

     Let me tell you this ANIME IS AMAZING!\
It took me only one episode to LOVE this anime! If you love a sort of dark-comedy with a twist then this is perfect! ( or a little insane) Anyway the characters are great, in particular GASAI YUNO, she is a perfect yandere character! I mean she is so mentally unstable she can't leave Yukki or she goes haywire! Besides the point of her insanity it is really interesting to see how the story plays out, it reminds me of Higurashi and Mayo Chiki a lot. They are many other worthy characters to mention like 9th, a\
          \
        kick-ass and totally lone ranger. She comes off as arrogant and independent, but after awhile it is easy to see that she has a soft side (but she is still tough!) I mean after having her eye hit with a dart by Yukki and then gouged out by one of the other players she is tough. Now more on the main character...Yukki is well in a word CUTE! He is just and innocent kid with a diary, an insane stalker, and at least 10 other people trying to kill him. He is repeatedly called \"pathetic\" but I still believe there is more than meets the eye (tehe), but he eventually goes through a lot of trauma but still ends up GOD (pretty cool if you ask me). But this anime is funny, twisted, dark, has a few yaoi aspects for those who like that, a great romance plotline, and plenty of other entertaining characters! PLEASE WATCH THIS! You will not be not regret it all!!!! P.S. GASI YUNO has to be the best just phycotic freakin insane wierdo I have ever seen! \

    It took me a while to finish this show, for multiple reasons.  One of the reason was I could not stand the characters and direction it was going in till episode 9.  My friend said it will get better in time and after a month I got back to it and thankfully it got a lot better.  It still had its problems but it got somewhat more enjoyable.

        story in here is really interesting.  This is one of the elements I enjoyed the most.  It contains a lot of tragedy for a lot of the characters and it did go into a lot of unexpected areas.  Especially at the end, I didn’t see it coming but it did bring up the rating I would have given it.  It is also very memorable, that I can promise.\
Art 7/10: There are a lot of images that can go to a high level.  Yes there are a lot of deaths scenes but there are also rapes, abuse, and creep out stalker moments.  I mean it does help better understand where the characters are coming from and it is better to have a visual add.  But wow on what they showed, this isn't one of the reason I hated this show, but it should be mentioned.\
Sound 4/10: The sound in this honestly wasn't that memorable.  To get a memorable moment for the images that I had mention early they have to give it the right tone to give it an extra oomph to make it much more powerful.  To me it felt like they had a basic tone for this.  I mean they do it right a few times, but really it isn't worth talking about.  Also no one's VO stood over the top to me.  Am just saying.\
Character 5/10:  Okay this is where I hated this show for the characters.  Everyone here is insane, without a doubt.  They so over the top it is annoying and the main character we follow is a guy that cries at least 2 or 3 times in a single episode, and there are 26 episodes.  Yukiteru Amano is the main character and I started the show with \"hating him more than a salt free diet\" to \"I hate him but I can tolerate him.\"  He does show some growth in the show but it is very, very little and most of the time I was yelling \"Grow a pair and do something.\"  The only character I enjoyed seeing was Minene Uryuu, or Ninth in the show.  Her development was much better done and she has real good qualities.  It was sad that her role was \"supporting character\" but it was a large support role, but it does in bits.\
Enjoyment 6/10: If I had written this review when I stopped at episode 8 the enjoyment and overall would be much lower, but when I got to episode 9 it did pick up and I did enjoyed it a bit more as the story did progress in certain directions that I didn't see coming.  However, most of the characters still needed better work or development.  Aside from the end and a few good plot twists, I was mildly entertained but not overly entertained.\
Overall 7/10:  If you can survive all the way to episode 9 then you may as well see the entire thing.  They do have some good plot twist and images early on (one of which is really, really creepy), but it isn't as strong as in the later episodes to me.  But if you are into insane characters and an even crazier plot twist, then I would recommend this to you.\

    Introduction\
\"Doesn't matter if you're weak. If you struggle hard enough, you can make a miracle happen.\" — Minene Uryuu, Mirai Nikki, 9th Diary Holder.\
\
Yukiteru Amano (Better known as Yuki) is a loner who never really interact with people and prefers writing a diary on his cell phone with his only companion being an imaginary friend named Deus Ex Machina, the God of Time and Space. However, Yuki soon learns that Deus is not a figment of his imagination but real when Deus makes him a participant in a battle royale with eleven others. Within this \"Diary Game\", the contestants are given special diaries that can\
          \
        predict the future with each diary having unique features that gives them both advantages and disadvantages, whoever wins the battle royale is crowned the successor of Deus as the God of Time and Space.\
\
Story\
Although I really enjoyed the anime, it's one of those animes where you can't tell too much about it without spoiling it, I'll do my best to summarize it without spoiling anything for you.\
The plot happens around the Main characters, Yukki and Yuno, as mentioned before, Deus Ex Machina, The God of Time and Space, invented a game to choose his successor as God, Yukki had been chosen as one of the players, although against his will he was forced to participate in this game, Yuno was also a player of this game, funny enough, it was a girl from Yukki's own class in school, which then becomes friends with Yukki, in this Kill or be Killed game.\
The first episode features Yukki's daily life and his relationship with Deus, along with how he reacted to discovering that his cellphone now was a diary that predicted the future and how Yuno became his \"friend\".\
The story although I loved it, is a bit repetitive and both Yukki and Yuno join forces to defeat the other 10 players, so it's a bit repetitive as they face a new player every second episode.\
Although it's repetitive, there's many plot twists, early in the story, half way the story and especially at the end of the story, which in my opinion is what made this such a great anime.\
If you aren't much of a philosophical person I don't recommend this anime, this anime can be pretty bland if you don't take your time to think about the characters, how they felt, why they did the things they did, and how would you feel and do in their situation, if you do these things you'll have a greater understanding of how this story was supposed to be watched/read as, a tragedy,romance and action.\
\
Story wise, although it had one or two plotholes from what I've noticed, I really enjoyed the story, which you can only understand completely after watching the end because it's when all the mystery's in the show are resolved, but since it was pretty weak at the start and it took 20's episodes for us to understand the whole story, I give this a 7/10\
\
Characters\
Although many people say the characters were pretty badly written, it isn't entirely true, there were bad characters, not gonna deny it, but most people judge Yukki and Yuno just for their initial appearance without disregarding the ending and the story behind them, nor the character progression throughout the story.\
Each and every character has a back story on why they are like they are and some of them are very interesting, I personally enjoyed Yuno's backstory, Minene's character progression and the 7th's backstory..\
\
Although I personally find Yuno's character a perfect 10/10, there are a few characters who were completely ridiculous which created the plotholes in this anime, so I give characters and average of 7/10.\
\
\
Animation\
Mirai Nikki was produced by Asread, which had at most a couple of famous series under their belts but nothing extraordinary, although the studio wasn't that great, the animation wasn't bad, again, nothing extraordinary either but I enjoyed the character designs and some of the scenes. I give it a 7.5/10\
\
Sound\
Although I'm not the kind of person who watches the openings and endings, the first Mirai Nikki opening was pretty damn good, so good that I watched it all the time until it was switched for the second opening.\
The other openings and endings were alright, I watched them all before writing this review and they were fine.\
The OST \"Time to Battle\" I believe it's the name, is also awesome, I find myself even nowadays listening to the 20 minute version of it. I give it a 9/10\
\
Conclusion\
Although this is my favorite all time anime and I rated it a 10/10 in MAL, I can't bias or this review is useless, as such I give this anime 2 different ratings.\
* If you aren't a psychological person and aren't able to get into the characters shoes and understand them then I would rate this anime 6.5/10.\
* If you are indeed a psychological person and you take your time to understand everything the anime tells you about the characters and why they did what they did in the anime and why they acted like that, this can potentially be a 10/10 Romance/Tragedy anime, however basing myself on the not so good characters and not the perfect animation, I would say it's a 8.5/10\
\
\
I recommend this show as it's my favorite show, there are many people who didn't completely understand the story or didn't take time to think about the story and the characters like the writer intended the viewers to and as such they have bad opinions about the show (which is totally fine) as long as you keep an open mind you'll have one hell of a ride.\

    What makes a series great? Different people have different opinions regarding this matter. Is it the story? Is it the characters? Or is it just good as a whole?\
Mirai Nikki or other people may know it as, Future Diary unfortunately falls under the category where the characters were good, the storytelling excellent but once you stop and look at it as a whole, it falls short of something. However as a stern warning to people whom are weak against violence or bloodshed, this is not the anime for you. Don't think that this would just be your typical normal comedy-romance series because it's nothing of\
          \
        the sort.\
The story follows the lives of Yukiteru Amano, a rather cowardly (I will touch on this later) recluse who doesn't have anything to do other than recording down events happening around him inside his cellphone's diary. It so happens that he has an imaginary friend called Deus Ex Machina which is apparently the God of Time and Space. Deus then tell him that he had prepared a game for him, a game of survival where the last remaining survivor would be able to inherit his powers and title as the God of Time and Space because he, the current God of Time and Space, is dying. He's indeed 'God' *insert sarcasm*\
Unable to escape from this survival game which he is dragged into, Deus gathered 11 other 'players' to join him in this little survival game of his by giving them 'future diaries' which gives the user powers of looking into the future depending on what kind of a diary it is. The diaries ranged from our main character's random events diaries(because like I said earlier, he has a habit of recording random stuffs) to escape diaries (it tells you route that you can escape to) to even a freaking Yukiteru diary(yes, it is not a typo but I will touch on that later).\
Like I said before, our main character is RATHER cowardly (note the emphasis and yes he's worse than Shinji from Evagalion). After obtaining his power he immediately saw on his future diary that he was going to die as he immediately panicked. Then enters the highlight and what makes the series so much more entertaining - Yuno. If you have lurked around the internet for a while, there's no way you haven't heard of her. You know , that pink headed girl that always seem to have a psychotic look on her face? Yes, that's her.\
Without spoiling too much, Yuno saves Yuki from his impending doom and managed to get rid of one of the twelve players. Oh remember I said about the Yukiteru diary? Yuno has that diary which predicts what our main character does. Wanna know why her diary does that? Well, take Juvia from Fairy Tail, Mikasa from Shingeki no Kyojin, Overly attached girlfriend from 9GAG and Lucy from Elfen Lied and combine all of them together and you end up with Yuno - an obsessive psychotic stalker which is a badass who won't let anyone touch her beloved. (yes I refrained from using Higurashi in those references).\
In other words, she's obsessively in love with our main character because of an incident in the past. However, because of that defeat, our beloved God of Time and Space(no really I should really use Deus but I still can't fathom how can he die) decides to make the game harder for Yuki by telling the rest of the players that our main character is in the lead and is the one most likely to win, shifting all of their attention to him. And of course, being the cowardly protagonist he is, he succumbs to the pressure but our Yuno definitely won't let anyone touch him and that's where the story is going.\
The Battle Royale concept is implemented in this show rather awkwardly in my opinion as the enemies would come one by one against Yukiteru which I find rather convenient as if they had teamed up. There's no way Yuno can protect him against all of them. However, there's no bullshit in that concept like plot armour which I personally hate. Oh did I mention that if your diary gets destroyed, you would die as well? \" People die when they are killed\" , yes thanks Shirou for the quote. So if you get killed or your diaries get destroyed, you disappear from the face of the Earth. Yes I'm looking at you Fairy Tail.\
However, that was not the actual story of the show but rather -- the premise in my opinion. The storytelling of Yuno's backstory as bits after bits of the mystery behind her gets revealed along as the series progresses. I found myself immersed with her rather than the show's premise itself as each episode ends with me wanting to know what the hell is she. For a moment, she can be sweet and gentle like your average school girl and suddenly her attitude can change in a blink of an eye to that of a psychotic killer. It's the mystery that she's shrouded in which makes the show so much more entertaining.\
As for the art, I don't really have any complains regarding the animation but there's nothing remarkable which I may want to add. However, this series has one of the best openings I have ever seen with stunning visuals in the OP1 along with a fitting song to go along with the dark theme of the series. The soundtrack - there's plenty of tracks which stood out and I can still remember them although I have finished with this anime for almost a year and the themes fit the scene nicely.\
The voice acting, if I had to nitpick then choose one that has done the best job, Yuno's voice actor. I have heard both the dub and the sub and I would have to say that the sub takes the cake. Although the voice actor is inexperienced from what I can gather from the wiki, she does an excellent job of portraying Yuno to the extent like I think no one can replace Jun Fukuyama as Lelouch and Mamoru Miyano as Yagami Light. I simply can't think of anyone else that can do a better job at portraying a psychotic yet sweet girl.\
I don't think I have to emphasis any more on the character department unless you would want to read me ranting on how much I hate Yukiteru and how much I love Yuno if you haven't figure out from the text above. Of course, there are several other characters which were developed pretty well and most of them did not feel bland at all. Some may find Yuno rather annoying but in my opinion, she carries the show much like the two examples which I have used earlier - Lelouch and Yagami Light (well, in Light's case, him and L). You would want to see her achieve her goal because she's really endearing.\
I truly enjoyed this series as one of the most nerve wrecking and emotionally attaching series (mainly Yuno. Yuno is love Yuno is life). However, this series is not without flaws. Enough of me pandering about singing high praises of this show because after I simmered down at the ending (yes I know the ending because I continued on from the manga). I looked back and thought - \" wow , this show has quite a lot of plot holes \". Things that I have never really stopped and think about started emerging in my head, putting down the series although I have thought it was one of the very best.\
Like why did Deus make this game in the first place? Why would you want someone that murders 11 people to be the God of Time and Space? Wouldn't you want to entrust the title and power to someone more worthwhile by testing their leadership skills instead of pitting them in a battle  to the death ? Also, because the series deals with time in general(future). There were several plotholes about time paradox which I shall not address here to prevent spoilers but those whom had watched the series should know.\
To conclude, Future Diary/Mirai Nikki is a worthwhile watch in my opinion despite it's flaws and I truly enjoyed the series. Come to think of it, I didn't think of the flaws when I was watching it was probably mainly because of the fast pacing of the story and I was too absorbed into the episodes which is a merit in itself. Although I may contradict myself here, I highly recommend this series even to the weak-hearted because Yuno is one of the best written characters and it's a shame not to watch it because of other flaws.\

    So wow. One of the main reason i loved this show is how different it was. i have never seen such a show! its not super high action but violence non the less.   just finished this anime and was blown away.\
        The art was Amazing! There are a few fight scenes that looked fantastic! The blood and gore and how the camera was angle for mystery, phenomenal. The characters all look ridiculously generic which is what they were going for so plus plus\
    The sound was another great great thing. Scenes where things\
          \
        were creepy the art helped apply a lot of the creep but the sound tipped me over and I would watch this before I went to bed and for some episodes i was geninuly afraid of the dark. The music doesnt neccisarly stand out for the creepy scenes but they do stand out for the love and sweet scenes. I actually have the songs on my phone and laptop i loved them so much. The way they would put together the sound with each scene was stupendous. It always cued at the right time and i genuinly felt love. Love for the characters, love for my friends and family, just love! The sound really shows this deep understanding and sorry i think. Just like \" This is a terrible terrible thing but i still love you even though i know we're going to die\" Thats what the music says to me.\
     I'm not the most experience anime addict but I have seen quite a few and I can see that most are pretty similar with generic character archetypes. Bad ass girls, guys that are too afraid to fight, rich snobs, intelligent males with a god complex, goofy side characters, emo/dark side characters. This show definitely has a couple of those but they make it obvious and exploit them like that. I guess i should have said in the beginning  Another reason i so loved it is each character with out flaw was super developed and had a back story or something driving them, a reason they were like that. you may say \"well that's awfully convenient\" but that's why they are  characters, because they are messed up. Yuno especially is a once in a life time character. she is so interesting and mysterious and surprising and thinks very objectively which i enjoy. I think Yukki could be compared to a lot of other protagonists. The side characters really do bring out the show with each having their own sweet back story and reason or drive why they have to win.\
   My personal enjoyment was 10/10. Every episode was so different from any other show! It was actually suprising and kept me addicted! I felt remorse for all the characters and they bring it together.\
    So all in the end the show was amazing please watch. add me on here im always willing to talk about anime since i have one friend who watches anime besides me at my school so im kinda lonly! But yeah. \

    Oh Future Diary.... There comes a time every now and then when I find an anime and think to myself, \"Boy this could be a really great show\" But I get this little whisper in my ear telling me \"IT'S A TRAP!\" Usually when this happens wonder what aspect of the show will be bad. Will the characters/story/art/sound be bad or worse... does it end with plot holes that could swallow up all of the galaxy? Future Diary.... a frustrating enjoyable snack.\
PLOT:\
The story revolves around a life or death survival game in which the god of the universe Deus Ex Machina; ok gonna stop you\
          \
        right there. If you're gonna rip off names from Greek mythology at least rip off you know a real name not a plot device that's suppose to wrap up a story. The irony of that name we'll get to later. As I was saying life or death game to see who will succeed Deus because he is dying; STOP STOP STOP. Isn't he a god? Why is a god dying that doesn't make sense. Did this seriously get through editing? No one asked the writers, \"Umm hey nice ideas but why is a god who is suppose to be well a god dying?\" The setup of the game is rather poor if you ask me. Anyway enough beating the horse. Life or death survival game to see who will succeed Deus Ex. There are a total of twelve participants in the game called \"Diary Users\" Each player is given a so called \"Future Diary\" that allows them to see what is going to happen in the future based on certain characteristics of the user. For example one of the Diary users is a cop so he gets future info on case information. To win the Diary User must be the last one standing I.E kill everyone else. The plot follows Yuki Amano and Yuno Gasai, two young high school kids who are trapped in this game and want to survive. Oh and by the way ROMANCE because this is anime and if there is a female and male lead you're damn right they gonna be lovers. The worst aspect of the story has to be the romance between Yuki and Yuno mainly because it isn't a romance. It's a one sided obsession. Lucky for us the writers had a good idea and didn't completely make the show about them. The show just follows them on their quest to win. The show goes in arcs usually with a new diary user of the arc coming in to be ripped to shreds by a combo of Yuki finding an interesting way to use the diary and Yuno being... well really good with an axe. \
CHARACTERS:\
Meet Yuki Amano a cry baby wimp who turns into wannabe Lelouch/Light ripoff 2.0. Yuki is just a quiet kid who soon discovers he can read the future and when that happens his whole life gets flipped upside down. Despite my first statement on him Yuki is actually a rather decent character. He's a bit on the bland side of \"Just wanting to end the game and kill no one\" but he does it an a unique until events happen that I won't mention cause spoilers. He gets some good development but I wish he became more that generic crybaby hero. Then there is the case of Yuno Gasai... a girl cloaked in mystery that is in love... and I mean IN LOVE with Yuki who also happens to be very very very very VERY good at killing people. I many be in the minority but I did not like Yuno as a character. To start they wasted the potential she had as one because the development she gets towards the end gets derailed because the writers thought that a super mind blow plot is better than characters they had been developing. One thing I do give the show credit for is having Yuki realize that Yuno is phyco... a statement that is often repeated by him throughout the show. I think they also tried too hard to make her back-story tug at your emotions. The supporting cast is rather mediocre but a stand out is Akise who comes around later and has spoilers all over the place if I try to explain why he is a good character. The thing that makes the characters good was the interaction between Yuno and Yuki. It seemed like a rather believable interaction between the two if you took out the crappy romance that was jammed in there.\
ART/ANIMATION:\
Mmmmm I love me some well animated action shows yes I do. The animation for Future Diary is top notch. The action sense are well do and even the regular sense have high quality animation. A note, if you don't like blood.... I would recommend not watching this show because there is a lot..... a lot... of blood. Almost to much blood for my taste but some of the sense that have Yuno smiling with blood splattered on her face just creeped me the hell out which is a good thing. The character designs are also very tasteful as well.\
SOUND:\
Dat opening. A very good opening song gets the adrenaline running. The music in the show always seemed to fit the mood but none of it stood out supper well but it did its job non the less. The dub for Future Diary was done by Funimation and was done very well. Josh Grelle does a wonderful job as Yuki. Something to point out, this is one of the main things that I really liked about the show was the voice acting of Yuki, I'm not exactly a fangirl of Josh but gosh dang his portrayal of Yuki made his character probably better than what it really was. Brina Palencia is the voice of Yuno and does a great job in a creepy psychotic way. She made Yuno sound so positive as she is killing people left and right. A special shout out to Kent Williams for doing an amazing job as Deus Ex... his voice is just mmmmmm. \
ENDING (NO SPOILERS):\
And here is where the 9 drops to a 7... Oh dear me why did you have to do this. Why are anime studios allowed to get away time after time of making great show and then RUINING it by making the ending absolute garbage? First off they try to hide the fact that the ending is so awful because they make it seem like \"Oh no really everything is sunshine and rainbows\" WRONG! Plot holes everywhere. I can't even begin to describe how infuriated I was by all the plot holes they just left open and said \"deal with it\" I tried really hard to accept the ending they gave to us but I could not accept it for what is was because of all the plot holes they just left unexplained. This kind of thing drives me up a wall and it needs to stop. To anime studios... for the love of Deus start making your shows have proper endings.\
OVERALL:\
Future Diary is for a fact ruined by its awful ending. However! I still enjoyed this show to an extreme amount. The character interactions were quiet good. The animation and action of the series was also quiet good and the show at least had an interesting idea behind it that never quite ended up were I would've like it but alas we can't be so lucky. I am hesitant to recommend this show because the ending is just so bad, but I do give it an recommendation to watch cause at the very least it is an entertaining watch until you start to notice all the plot holes... Future Diary.... you will be missed... because we can't find out which hole you fell into.\

    This anime does one thing so incredibly well that, while it does have a ton of faults, the show is still very good and well worth a watch.\
As far as this show goes there's very little I can say without spoiling it so this review will likely be a little short.  The best part of this show is, by far, the way they absolutely nailed their portrayal of the stalker character Yuno.\
Good god I've never had an anime freak me out before but...  This chick is terrifying!  She goes from one extreme to the other so quickly that it makes your head\
          \
        spin.  Also the animation they give for her, especially her eyes, is so absolutely spot on that the entire show could ride on it to success.  Some would argue that it does; and I'd be lying if I said I didn't agree with that to a point.\
The story is a classic example of great intentions with great delivery... until (The Fire Nation Attacked!) disaster strikes.  At first I though of it as a genre breakdown with Deadman Wonderland aspirations in regard to the blood and gore.  But then they go and try to make certain characters lovable and suddenly plot holes start appearing and by the end the show is more confusing than anything else.  But that doesn't mean it wasn't a fun ride downward.\
As weird as this sounds, this didn't hamper my enjoyment of the show.  The characters are all very well done which makes the plot holes seem a lot less of a problem than one would think.  However if a plot hole immediately ruins a show for you you are going to struggle with this anime.\
The animation, especially the opening opening, is quite good with a couple really high points.  If you don't ever want to watch this show the opening is still well worth a watch.  It tells everything and nothing, the music is great.  And the animation is fantastic!  Moving on.\
While a 7 for an anime with such story problems may be a bit of a stretch I can honestly say I got a 7/10 worth of enjoyment from this anime.  It's such a great ride that you most likely wont even notice the problems in the plot until your second viewing.\
Overall I think this anime is phenomenal.  The stalker is great, the plot holes are certainly there, but not the reason most would watch this show, the characters are all done well and given plenty of screen time, and the ending is polarizing but unique.  It's well worth the watch if you haven't already seen it.\

    The god of time and space will die soon. In order to keep the world intact, he has to decide who will be the next in throne.. so he conducted a game-- a survival game. The last one to survive, will be the next god of time and space. Unwillingly, Yukiteru Amano (also called as Yukkii), our main character, participated the game. He knew that he has no chance of winning. But with the help if Yuno Gasai, a psychopath stalker, Yukiteru may have a chance to survive.\

This anime is about struggling to survive, with the help of the Future Diaries, and who will inherit the title \"god\". \"Mirai Nikki\" is covered with all sorts of emotions-- fear, happiness, excitement, sadness. But at its very core, this anime revolves around love.. Of how one's willpower can change the future. And even as you go nearer to the ending, all things were for the reason of love.. or is it obsession? \
Yuno Gasai is the spice of the story. Her twisted thinking made the anime more interesting and worthwhile. Her obsession for Yukiteru makes you guess if she'll really protect him or kill him at the end. You may ask of how can Yukkii trust her so much despite of her shady personality and past. But if we were in Yukkii's shoes, Yukkii really doesn't have much of a choice. The only way he sees to survive is to stick with Yuno. \
The overly-attached-girlfriend personality of Yuno is so creepy that you'll get annoyed yet love her at the same time. Well, that what makes her \"Yuno\" after all. Her insanity reaches to the point where you can no longer see what she's thinking.. her mind is sooo twisted. And that makes the story exciting and full of mystery.\
The thing about this anime is that it'll make you think of the possible ending. 1. Yukiteru will win and Yuno will be loyal and die (because we all know that Yukiteru is so much for a good guy) 2. Yuno will betray Yukiteru and inherit the title \"god\" 3. Both of them will die (it's either they'll commit double suicide, or the world will end since none of them became the winner). But you'll be really surprised of how things ended, no jokes. This anime is full of surprises (though some things were a little bit off and too much).\
The art of this anime was quite amazing. Nothing was rushed and shabby. Everything compliments the scenario-- if it's action, flashback, sad scenes etc. Even the backgrounds and landscapes were so detailed. I find the art smooth and beautiful. I salute the artist/s!\
\"Mirai Nikki\" offers you a peek of the future from your diaries. An exciting, thrilling, blood-rushing, heart-pounding anime. Full of mysteries that will keep you watching until the very end.\
What I like about this anime is that everything was revealed at the ending. As I finished watching it, I became satisfied. My doubts and questions were answered, there is nothing to be confused about. So sit back, relax and keep watching. There'll be unexpected twists and explanations to come~\
Mirai Nikki is a brilliant mix of a Psychological Thriller, Action, and Romance. A breath of fresh air of obsession.\

    Mirai Nikki or Future Diary is an Action, Mystery, Supernatural, Psychological, Thriller anime about people trying to kill each other to become god of time and space. The people have these phones called Future Diaries and everyone's is different. If your phone breaks then you'll die.\
Story: The story is very interesting. It's like the Hunger Games but in the city. The way it's portrayed will probably keep you glued to the screen. \
8\
Art: The art is no '5cm per second' but it's definitely not bad. The blood looks smooth and I'm saying this because there's quite a lot. It's art is above average but not\
          \
        enough to be amazing.\
8\
Sound: The opening is AWESOME especially when 'animenzz' on Youtube plays it on the piano it's awesome. The voice actors actually fit the anime characters extremely well and the OST fits the mood/atmosphere.\
9\
Character: There is quite a big amount of characters as it's a bunch of people trying to become god by killing others. \
Yuuki is the main character and he is the wimpy type of person. He has absolutely no confidence in him and i despise his type of character. He relies on Gasai Yuno who he teams up with against his will. Now usually in shounen type anime, the wimpy character gets much stronger or more awesome. Yuuki however is wimpy through 95% of the anime. NOW READ THIS. I hated Yuuki because he lacked confidence but in the last few episodes he gains quite a lot suddenly. But instead of finally liking him i HATED him so much more. You'll understand.\
Gasai Yuno is the other main character. She is AMAZING in so many different ways. If you're wondering why i didn't drop the anime because of Yuuki, it was because of Gasai Yuno. The way she does things is so crazy and psychotic, I love it. \
The other character have there own Qwerks but it's either to small or they don't even live long enough to like them. Still Gasai Yuno kind of saved the show from Yuuki.\
9\
Enjoyment: Mirai Nikki is an EXTREMELY unpredictable show. Usually the hero arrives late but if you do that in Mirai Nikki, if you're late someone's gonna die. That just an example so it wasn't a spoiler. I have seen plenty of anime and i can predict quite a lot of scenes and stuff but that failed completely when i watched Mirai Nikki. I enjoyed it A LOT. \
10\
Overall: The anime definitely has incredible moments but there was a standard amount of Shite, crap, pieces of **** scenes that made me go, TELL ME WHY?!?!?!? Mostly with Yuuki in them. The awesome moments were mostly by 2 female characters. One is Gasai Yuno and the other is ________ (watch this anime :D)\
8\
Anime Genre:\
The Action is top notch. Beautiful explosions, awesome fight scenes and knife throwing. \
Mystery - There were a lot of mysteries in which i was eager to find but there were a few where i did not give a damn. Still the important ones were freaking crazy till the end. \
Supernatural, Psychological, Thriller - All of these were absolutely phenomenal, there wasn't too much to make it seem like the anime was a fantasy but there was enough to make me enjoy it. \
There is also a nice romance touch between Yuuki and Yuno. If you're wondering whether there are kisses then yes there are some.   \
Seriously though if you're wanting a dark, thriller anime that will move you to tears if you usually cry then watch it. It will definitely be worth your time.\
Also i forgot to mention how there aren't really any cliches in this anime. You'll probably understand when you see it.\

    In art, there are many branches, and each one of them represent a way of expression in particular. And as times advance, we could get a lot of other branches to express ourselves through influences or inspire us to create a new one. In other cases we could have a node made out of branches, wich could represent more of an eclectic point of view, gathering what we think is the best of every world.\
Enter Mirai Nikki, an anime that became just as popular as it is, because it gathered every single element that makes any series a successful one in terms of popularity and\
          \
        hype. And what are these elements? I thought you'd never ask! Well:\
Mirai Nikki follows the story of Yukiteru, a lonely and extremely shy and passive boy who enjoys spending his time writing down everything (and im serious about the \"everything\", it's literally EVERYTHING) that happens around him using his cell phone as a real-time diary. These writings will soon attract the supreme god of the Universe, \"Deus ex Machina (I know what you are thinking :D)\", to give some kind of special powers to his diary thing. He will soon realize that his diary has no need to be written anymore, for it is being written by itself before everything even happens. In other words, he can predict the future. And this is where shit gets real. As he's reading, Yukiteru comes to realize the fact that he's being chased to be murdered, and he is saved by our female lead character, Yuno; And she used to do the same thing Yuki did, with the difference that \"Everything\" is swapped with \"Everything that Yuki does\". She's completely romanticly obsessed with him. As Yuki is safe, Deus grabs him and explains \"the plan\" he has to select his successor. He gave a handful of -special- people the power to enhace their diaries with super powers similar to Yuki and Yuno, and they have to kill each other. The last one standing, earns the right to be Deus' successor.\
The premise's concept is somewhat unique and truly hooking. It is a really great start if you ask me. From there on, the plot progress is an over the top carnage that goes on non-stop. It contains large ammounts of gore.\
The characters are all somewhat emotionally broken and quite unsatisfied with their own lives, and that's the thing they all have in common. They all want to take this chance to be the next God, to fix their own terrible past. And this is what makes this series what it is, its cast is mainly composed of the most cruel and threatening people, and these crazy ass dudes and dudettes are the ones who keep the show going and going on. While this is entertaining, here lies the main problem that I have with Mirai Nikki. Given the dark, crazy, over the top and non-stop nature of the premise and the anime as a whole, it also falls into the abyss of trying too hard to make the next event more and MORE and MMMMMOOOOOORRREEEE crazy than the one that just happened, and at some point, it backfires hard. It is entertaining in the sense that it will keep your morbid fascination fed and satisfied, but there are so many events, that honestly it turns into an awkward and rather embarassing watch.\
The art and animation in this anime is pretty consistent, for a lack of a better word. It was good, but there was never a moment where I was shocked by it.\
Character design is somewhat unique and fits the context perfectly, giving really distorted and excentric looks to every character without falling into the \"clowny\" feel.\
When it comes to the sound, I have to admit that this show has one of the few Openings that I could not skip because it was awesome. It had this \"escape and survive\" feel, and whatever your musical taste is, it will hype you and make you feel like boiling water.\
Background music was something that reminded me quite a lot of teen-horror american movies. It was good, but i kept feeling that it was too fast paced for the most part. It could have gotten a much more suspense-oriented feel to them. \
I don't really know what to say about the voice acting.\
Back to the plot, I'm gonna warn you that right now there will be some spoilers.\
When it comes to the plot progress, as I stated when I talked about the characters, I consider it a ball of fire that pushes any limits beyond imaginable and eventually explodes. But the gore and killing stuff is not the only thing that Mirai Nikki is about. Mirai Nikki also has its bit of love and character development, which, to my taste, was executed rather poorly. And this is mainly due to the plot twists presented nearly at the end of the series. The stuff that happened there make you so confused that you will not be able to answer the questions by yourself at your first watch. Specially if you are paying huge ammounts of attention to the plot instead of the gore and shock-inducing elements. There are many things unexplained, but if you turned your brain off and enjoyed all the action, gore and others alike, you will fully enjoy this without much to worry about.\
I enjoyed Mirai Nikki quite a lot, despite its flaws. The premise was simply spectacular and I couldn't help but have fun watching this until the last second.\
*And yes, I did NOT talk about Yuno in depth AT ALL! :D Sorry fans, but I like the neutral point of view.\
If you have feedback for me, let me know what you think. Constructive criticism is always well received.\

    I think the concept was nice, and this had potential to be great anime. In fact, I probably would've loved the manga if I read it. But it was so poorly made in my opinion that I had to drop it.\
I blame the failure on the directing. They just took something nice and turned it into everything wrong with anime. \
The voice acting was one of the worst problems for me. most of them were fine, but Yuno's voice actress killed it entirely. it ruined the character completely. so pathetically try hard kawaii and innocent. (I wouldn't blame the actress herself, I haven't actually looked\
          \
        into other parts that she did. She could just as well be told to sound like that by the director).\
In general, Yuno was completely destroyed by fanservice. She obviously is the main part of the story, and therefore should be represented like a proper main character, with depth and all. But instead (and probably because she's female too), she was downgraded not to just a supporting character, but to a f'ing DECORATION! all of her potential depth was shadowed by forced cuteness, boobs and the shalowness that the director probably sees female characters as.\
Another very irritating thing was that very hard things, scenes that would probably make you cry in the manga, were taken lightly and shallowly, while stupid shallow things were put under emphasis.\
Overall, I found this series shallow and disappointing.",

    It's strange how one thing and one thing only can make a show so popular, even if it sometimes doesn't make any sense why. People become so infatuated with this one thing that they overlook most of the flaws and quite possibly other upsides to the anime. This doesn't make the show utterly shit, nor does it make it the best thing in existance. It just causes this “super-important factor” to be the central point of this anime. Mirai Nikki, or The Future Diary is one of these anime. The anime has gained its popularity due to a single character's archetype. That's it. So! Mirai\
          \
        Nikki... Note: This review contains a number of spoilers, and since there;s a few of them, I won't bother marking them out.\
STORY\
The premise of Future Diary is interesting as much as it is misleading. The story follows a shy and socially-awkward teen called Yukiteru Amano, or Yukkii, who likes to keep a diary of his day-to-day life. But one day, his diary begins to predict his future actions, which he begins to use to his advantage, like cheating in exams. Soon, he is called on by the God of Space and Time (Deus Ex Machina, because why the fuck not) who informs him and eleven other (un)lucky diary owners of a “battle-royale” situation they have been thrown into. The prize for winning: the successor of this God.\
Oh yeah, there's also a girl. Her name is Yuno Gasai, and she's Yukkii's stalker and future love. For some stupid reason she's madly in love with him, and protects him for the duration of this game. She's basically a yandere, which is the show's major selling point. \
So. There are a few problems that I have with the setting and the story in general. The story is misleading like I already mentioned. Firstly, the description “Battle Royale” is bullshit. This anime is not a battle royale. For some stupid reason, almost every single diary user attacks Yukkii, and in that case, Yuno. In a BR situation, it would be a stupid decision for everyone to focus on two individuals. This is just shameless plot convenience, as it allows for the anime to take two or three episodes at a time for each of the diary holders. And the others? Fuck do I know, have a sit down with a cup of coffee? These episodes are almost always predictable, which makes the middle section of the anime PAINFULLY difficult to watch. Huh, kinda makes sense now why they actually named a character Deus Ex Machina.\
Then there's the whole time-travel ending. It is very difficult to remove all plot holes of an anime with time travel. The OVA episode only does so much, so by the end of it we still have unanswered questions. Luckily though, it did pick up slightly so at least the creators had kept the climax until the very end. \
Mirai Nikki liked to take itself seriously. But sometimes it tripped over itself and fell face first. It felt like the show didn't know where it was going, so “serious” moments like raping an underage girl, or locking up a child in a cage and feeding it grass, turned out to be less serious. These fucked up moments were somewhat enjoyable, but they felt like they were done, just for the sake of being done. \
Other than that and other ridiculous moments (gassing people in a vented room, I mean come on.) the story was fine. “Just above average” is the best description of how good the story was.\
CHARACTERS\
Oh my god, what the fuck is up with the cast? It's as if the creators didn't care one bit when they made the characters, since one stereotypical character would solve all problems. But let's start off with the MC. Yukkii is in my shitlist as one of the worst characters I have ever seen. Annoying, bland, and completely fucking useless, yet the show still tries to make him interesting by throwing him into really difficult situations, only for him to cry and whine in the middle of a battle. On top of that, the anime tries desperately to change him as a character by the end. And it does! From a useless bitch, he goes to a total selfish cunt, and has no redeeming features at all. NONE. Great job guys.\
For those of you who find my description of him puzzilng, think Shinji Ikari developing into Makoto Itou. For those that don't agree, get out. And just like Makoto, he is just as indecisive about his relationship with Yuno. All he is is a plot device. \
And then there's the psychotic bitch. Yuno is basically the face of the entire anime. Unfortunately, I hated her very existence, very much like Yukkii. If he is a plot device, then Yuno is a plot armor. All she is there for is to protect the main character from everyone else from killing him. I simply cannot understand why she is so likeable. All she does is act like a clingy bitch and then kill everyone. Don't get me wrong, I like the Yandere archetype, but it's difficult to get right – something this anime did not do. The best examples of yandere done right that I can think of are the Sonozaki twins from Higurashi. That anime doesn't just take the two main characteristics of the archetype and fuck the rest like Mirai Nikki. The personality is much more subtle than with Yuno, so it is more effective when shit hits the fan. However, Yuno's archetype is so obvious that it is practically leaking out of her. This causes her to change from the personality at one end of the spectrum to the other at the drop of a hat, and in especially in the worst moments. What is the result? Battles that are mostly predictable, where Yukkii cries like a bitch and Yuno comes in to save the day with a cliched monologue on her “love”. That is why I hate her, she just HAS to act warm and fuzzy, in the moments where it isn't called for. Nobody cares about your love, just decapitate that cunt and shut up. \
Even though she is in love with Yukkii, she constantly puts him down. She is even more of a selfish bitch than Yukkii. I mean, she would rather isolate Yukkii, and have him all to herself, (which she ended up doing anyway) rather than letting him have friends and be happy... \
So we have a bitchy and selfish main protagonist with an equally selfish and posssive bitch as a female protagonist. What a perfect couple.\
So what happens when the nonexistant love between them develops? Episode 23 happens! Holy shit, that sex scene was the most hilariously misplaced part of the entire final part of the show. Sure, it wasn't pathetic, but let me just remind you that the two are 14 years old. Just let that sink in.\
The rest of the cast is full of idiots and laughable villains. Even Deus, the creator of the game and the one pulling the ropes of the universe is an idiot. Honestly, out of all people to play the game, he had to pick Yukkii. \
None of the diary owners are interesting at all, to the point of some of them being laughable. Apart from Minene. Uryuu Minene was somewhat likeable, mostly because she was the only character with a likeable personality in the entire show. Until, of course, they turn her into a by-the-book tsundere. Other than that, none of the other characters deserve any mention, as they're just as forgettable as they are shit. \
ANIMATION & SOUND\
Mirai Nikki was made in the fall season of 2011, by a studio called Asread. This anime is by far their most popular work, aside from a few hardly-known anime titles. Other than that, they worked with Xebec on Shuffle! back in 2005 and with AIC Spirits on Ga-Rei Zero in 2008.\
When I first started watching Mirai Nikki, I didn't have huge problems with the animation. On the contrary, I thought the animation was pretty good....for an anime from the mid-2000's. Then I realised that the series was made at the same time as Anohana, Madoka Magica, Usagi Drop, Steins;Gate... Mirai Nikki is quite far below the standard of animation at the time. Poor detailing or just a lack of awesomness is the main issue with it, but it isn't something I'd consider “bad”. I'll admit, it's a bit unfair to compare the animation with that of anime from 2011, I mean, that was an amazing year! Mirai Nikki had its moments of decent animation. The gore scenes were well done, which was a sigh of relief for me. But there is one example of really fantastic animation, which is something I don't even need to go into: the first opening. \
The soundtrack is large and impressive – it has its fair share of action-scene tracks, as well as some tracks that really pull at the heartstrings, for example, “Here With You”, which is probably the most popular track with the exception of the first opening. It has really well-written orchestral compositions, including my favourite, “Going Through The Trials in Time”. Good job to the composer Tatsuya Katou, who has some interesting titles under his name... Free!, Kämpfer, The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan, Requiem for the Phantom, and Food Wars.\
The opening track “Fantasy Mythology” is quite frankly, one of the best opening tracks in existence. It just screams out the violence of the anime, especially Yuno. It's loud, it's heavy, it's fucking awesome. But of course it had to get replaced with the dissappointment of the broken English of the second opening. Sigh...\
The Japanese dub is really enjoyable, with the voice actors of Yuno and Minene doing what in my opinion was a great job. I haven't heard the English dub, but judging by the names of the dub cast, I may have something to look forward to, especially since Brina Palencia is in there. But seriously, the dub has some awesome names in there: Josh Grelle, Todd Haberkorn, Eric Vale, Coleen Clinkenbeard, Christopher Sabat, Caitlin Glass, Jad Saxton, J.M Tatum, Monica Rial.... just look at those names! It's gotta be a good dub, right?\
FINAL EVALUATION\
I'll be honest, this anime was somewhat of a dissappointment to me. Mirai Nikki has a lot of flaws, many of which are major, but it is still somewhat enjoyable. Although the premise of the story was interesting, shabby writing and a pathetic cast of characters let it down quite a bit. On the other hand, the animation wasn't the worst thing in the world, and the soundtrack was really enjoyable.\
I must admit, my enjoyment of the show overall was somewhat ruined, mostly by the irritating moron that Yukkii was, and also Yuno for being similarly annoying, and not making much sense on a number of occasions. \
I give Mirai Nikki a 6.4, and unfortunately, must round to 6.\
The faults of the anime can be easily overlooked if you switch off your brain, but if you do that you won't understand the final episodes. The cast of characters was simply too much of a trainwreck, and that is what really brought down the final score. Do I hate Mirai Nikki? No. It's one of those shows that I can call “good enough”. Many will disagree, but oh well. \
The anime simply spent too much time focusing on how much of a cold-blooded and blatantly stereotypical yandere Yuno could be, and after a while, it just became tiring.\
I may watch it again with the hope of the English dub being any better, which may or may not raise the final score.\

    I'm not big on writing, so please be kind to me xD \
I personally got engulfed in this story line, it wasn't an anime that had me at the first episode, but it grew on me, and I'm not sure when it happened but i found myself forcing myself to stay awake at 5am when I have work just for the next episode. \
For me this anime is one where to have to try and see things from every possible perspective, you can see your veiw as the audiance and as you're set back from the actions you can see what you would do and\
          \
        what you think yuki should have done, but at the same time, you have to see things from their veiw. This was an anime that had me thinking alot about the characters and their psyche of these characters. \
The art style to me was perfect for the story, it was the perfectly complementary. The light bright colours against a dark story is something that I personally love to see. \
the twists at the end seem to be bad writing and all over the place but when you actually look at it, it all makes perfect sense, if you have the IQ of over 4 you could figure it out, I feel the writers focased beautifully of the minds of these characters and you would have, to as I said, look from the characters mind and understand why everything happened the way it did.\

    Imagine Romero & Juilet got mugged down a dark alleyway by Doctor Who with a bucket of blood, and you're halfway there to The Future Diary. Only, in this case Romero is terrified of Juilet because she's murderously insane.\
The show is an absurd black romantic comedy, that doesn't let reality get in the way of entertainment, and gleefully dives into territory what would be simply too grotesque for something that was taking itself seriously. It liberally throws in elements of horror, suspense and mystery and is largely carried by the character of Yuno Gasai, the insane Juilet in question, who is delightfully psychopathic in 'protecting'\
          \
        her love, and possbily the most watchable female lead in an anime.\
The show is some what let down by the odd gaping discrepancy, a relatively weak male lead, and a shift over the latter third of the show towards a more serious tone, and in fact, the sudden reapperance of a certain character towards the end was probably an attempt to re-establish an element of absurdity. But if you're inclined to turn your brain off a little, the show remains a wide ride all the way to the end.\

    Mirai Nikki started off as something I thought I would enjoy, and overall I think it's something I'm glad I found. The art was great and I loved the music, and there were many colorful characters. However, I don't think enough time was put into character development or explaining the reasons behind their actions.\
The story started off at a good pace, but the ending felt very rushed. It was almost like everything that happened beforehand didn't matter anymore, and there was very little explanation of what was happening and why. \
Overall, I was only really disappointed with the end of Mirai Nikki. To anyone who\
          \
        is thinking about watching it, a fair warning: it's disturbing. I thoroughly enjoyed it's weirdness.\

    \"The Future Diary\" is another one of those Anime everyone tells you, \"You gotta see!\" and therefore many people have. So many, in fact, I feel it's rather pointless to write this review. But, I hope you the reader find it helpful, regardless. This show has one of the stronger premises I've ever seen in any TV show, let alone in Anime. It works well off this and provides lots of suspense, action, drama, and even some dark humor. \
On top of that, we get some really great characters along the way. Our main character, Yukiteru Amano, is put in a situation where his peaceful\
          \
        world is shattered and he is faced with an ordeal that has the very fate of the world at stake. And what does he do? Freaks the heck out and cries... a lot. He would be pathetic if he weren't so realistic. Practically stitched to his side is the leading lady and iconic Yuno Gasai, a girl so crazy and devoted to her man that even Harley Quinn would call her too clingy. The two headline a cast of characters that range from a serial killer and a terrorist, to a cop and a costumed vigilante (think more Samurai Flamenco than Batman) and each help enrich the plot and the show. \
The art is very good and has minimal amounts of CG to pair with it making the show more authentic Anime than just some hand-drawn characters in a virtual world. Great sound throughout and supply some really cool noises that I wish my phone made. Then again, my phone doesn't tell the future. Or does it?! No, it doesn't. Cause it would probably be telling me right now to get on with the review and finish up soon because I'm wasting my time on something no one is going to read, anyway. *sigh*\
Overall, I really enjoyed this show and was genuinely on the edge of my seat for some episodes. The tension builds and builds before taking a very twisted road to a solid conclusion. But, do hang on, the third act is by far the most difficult to get through and wrap your mind around. Imagine if Christopher Nolan and James Cameron joined forces on script- yeah, it's that kinda crazy. The Sub vs. Dub battle is won by the Sub if not just for the classic and iconic performance that is Tomosa Murata's Yuno Gasai. Who knew saying, \"Yukki\" could be an art form?\
I highly recommend this Anime to anyone who enjoys a good action/sci-fi/thriller and at only 26 episodes it's an easy one to get through. Overall, I give this show a solid 8/10. Check it out. Cheers! \

    This is definitely the kind of anime where you either love it or hate it. The other reviews on here definitely show that. Personally, I loved it.\
The story is pretty unique, I personally haven't seen another anime where people are given the option to become God through a fight to the death in this way, and I thoroughly enjoyed every episode.\
The protagonist is often referred to as useless, but this is something that I like about Yuki. He's the type of character who would react the same way any sane human in the real would would react to this scenario, and he's only fourteen or\
          \
        fifteen, he's not meant to be able to face adults the way he's forced to. \
The only thing I dislike about this anime is a very nsfw scene towards the end of the show, since Yuki is only fourteen, and I am eighteen, I did feel uncomfortable watching this particular scene, but other than that there's not really any scenes in the show where I felt that level of discomfort.\
I also really like the art style used in this anime, Yuno is a particularly unique character in the anime and the way she has been drawn when going into her psychotic periods is excellent, you really get a creepy vibe off of her.\
Overall I enjoyed the anime so much that I gave it an 8 on my list, but for this review I'm giving it a 10/10 as I also recently rewatched it and my opinion definitely swayed and I definitely enjoyed it a lot more. The only thing you can't regain is the shock of the twists that the anime has. I would definitely recommend this anime to friends, and to anyone reading this review.\

    At first it might seem like that Mirai Nikki is just another anime about a survival game but watching it after also reading the manga, it seemed like it was actually allegorically about Yuno, or any young girl, doing what she wants with her life. A lot of the violence is metaphorical for Yuno simply disagreeing with those that disagree with her life choices. Each character is rather simply designed on purpose to highlight Yuno so that what the author is trying to get at is more easily seen. It still is hard to see though, my first time reading it, I thought it just\
          \
        existed for comedic purposes. So even if you are not interested in girls and them standing up against their parents +the world/society for what they want to do with their lives I would still recommend it for laughs though the violence might not be suitable to everyone. \
I'm now going to describe some of the characters and how they relate to Yuno and why I think the story is about what it is. There won't be spoiler content, just characters names and that Yuno must defeat them.\
In Japan mandatory education ends after middle school, when children are 15. \
Yukki is a young 14 year old boy who is a little odd, ( he's kind of special), He speaks to himself and his imaginary friend, and eventually his mother purchases a cellphone for him to have more conversations with his friend in saved text messages, he does this through out the school day and describes his surroundings to his friend who he sees as the time lord, his teachers let him do this in class. No one expects anything from him, including his single mother.He is one of the kids that teachers don't \"focus\" on because they don't believe he should continue on to high school, that he should just start working, (aka fry cook).\
Yuno is basically Yuuki's opposite, she goes to school and is in the same class, however she is the top of her grade and is good at everything, sports etc. She is an adopted child and her married guardians are very well off. They DO EXPECT a lot out of her and she is under a lot of pressure at home. However Yuno's desires for herself are more simple, she will probably be forced to go to high school and college despite this.\
Yuuki and Yuno are the same in that they both have no idea what to write on their career survey that is presented to Japanese middle school students towards the end of their 2nd to last year in middle school, so that teachers know what high school to recommend to their parents. (Yuno had a disagreement with her parents before this)high school is kind of like community college in japan, different schools cater to different career paths, liberal arts, sciences, etc. especially the private ones in Tokyo. \
To put it simply Yuno doesn't want to go to school, Yuuki has a crush on Yuno, when Yuno's parents put her in a barred cage (that is metaphorical for her parents not letting her do what she wants to do), Yuuki's friend becomes real and uses time to help Yuuki save her. In this route though after he leaves her out of the cage alone, Yuno becomes evil,(in that she will crush anyone who tries to put chains on her or get in the way of what she wants to do with her life.)  some time things happen, Yuuki doesn't remember this on route where the story starts. \
Yuno's simple idea of her life is that she is very focused on marriage and love.Yuno begins to focus on Yuuki and her cellphone diary turns into a stalker one.\
The first character that Yuno must defeat after the game starts is #3,\
he is their school teacher and he is represented as evil because Yuno is trying to escape the route where her parents and everyone around her forces her to continue with school. She ends up NEEDING Yuuki's help in defeating this character.\
When Yuno need's Yuuki's help it is the author talking about Yuno's weakness in her feminism because girls that don't get their degrees usually need financial help from men, and if say her marriage with Yuuki isn't perfect then she is in trouble possibly later.\
I will talk about #4 and #9 together. #9 is the holder of the escape diary and is a terrorist, of FEMINISM, she escapes things that try to hold her down, which is the main subject of what the author is trying to say about women and the way they should live their lives. #4 is the holder of the investigator diary, he is a cop, and also an enemy of #9, and feminism. \
#5 and #8 also get grouped together. #5 is a small evil menace toddler, #8 is a heavyset woman who so CHOOSES to spend her life raising orphan children. Yuno is in love and desires marriage but that doesn't necessarily include children. She NEEDS Yuuki's help to corner both of these diary holders.\
#6 is also a girl from a well off family, like Yuno, her parents put her in a traditional wooden Japanese Jail where she is later hurt, similar to Yuno's barred cage, however the parallels between the characters end there, since This girl is a blind bat and cannot see, how what her parents did for her wasn't good for her, since they gave her a temari ball, which represents the extras that children in well off families receive when they are young which will most likely convince them to pursue high earning careers like their parents so that they can continue to have these extras. The way this girl gets hurt suggests that the author really is putting down the type of girl who obeys her parents or any type of child who follows blindly especially when it isn't a good situation. (ouch I'm in college, I'm one of these)\
# 12 holds the justice diary, he has a prince/power ranger complex, where he sees himself that way. He is actually a misogynist. #6 is only partially blind because of her foolishness, the author makes #12 literally blind because of the way he sees women. I'm basing this part off of the scene where he hurts in some way #9th (the feminist terrorist) and then immediately asks her if she finds him attractive/cool.\
#7 is a couple who are in love and related to the orphanage that #8 cares for. However the love that they are in is not the marital love that Yuno dreams of but the more common love that it is hard to get away from these days with it being broadcast-ed everywhere by the media the way it is. Yuno struggles to defeat these two and what she sees as a lesser form of a relationship, but eventually with Yuuki's HELP she does so.\
#10 and #11 are both older men and represent father figures, #10 because he is the dad of another of their classmates, and #11 because of the relationship he has to the orphanage and to Yuno's parents, and because he is a powerful politician. Yuno defeats #11 by herself because she needs to in order to move on.\
Although I didn't realize it at first this story actually has some depth to it and it is also humorous. I liked how the art improved in the anime vs the manga, because usually it is the other way around, and also the openings and ending themes were enjoyable although the english lyrics in the 2nd opening were laughable, it was fun singing along to. \
I would also recommend Big Order the new show also by the same author, it is instead metaphorically about U.S. Marines getting the heck out of Japan  and that the world needs to stop blaming Japan for the things they did during WW2 since its been like 3 generations now, guys.\

    I felt so compelled after watching the anime that I just had to join and write a review. I took a long walk, and even recorded some things to help me put things into perspective. I'll start by saying this...If you're looking for depth and to be challenged on different levels of thinking, then definitely check out this anime.\
I'll explain my scoring a little. I thought the Story, Characters and Enjoyment were \"outstanding\". I thought the art and music was \"good\", there weren't any problems, but I wasn't hooked or mesmerized by the music, though I'm sure some people would be.\
Now for the good stuff;\
          \
        I'll try my very best not to spoil anything, but I do suggest, regardless of what's said, that you watch the anime for yourself. \
Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) hooked me from the first episode. Here is this  introverted young man that's about to embark on a journey. I thought the idea of the anime was creative and It kept me guessing and at the edge of my seat throughout the entire show. Initially I hadn't seen the number of episodes in the list, so as I watched it, I was hoping it would be longer than 12 episodes, because I just couldn't get enough of it. Just when I thought I had things figured out, a plot twist came hurdling into view and set things in a direction I hadn't even imagined.\
I'll be open, I hated Yukki throughout the entire show until the end. Many of his actions screamed \"selfish\", and not the kind where you're \"self-oriented\", but actually selfish. His supporting cast member Yuno, had problems of her own, many that I'll leave for you to see. If I were in a film class or a psychology class, I would use this film, because of it's dark corners and the nature of the dilemmas that the characters must traverse in order to survive. You can expect character development and a lot of this happens as the story's twists and turns lead you deeper into the story.\
The show pushes the boundaries; Good and Bad, Hero and Villain aren't things you can expect to see here. Throw out your typical lense and get some new spectacles. Expect to be brought deep. I was moved to tears in some instances, because it challenges the typical values and senses of morality that we're exposed too.\
\"What would you do if you were Yukki?\" This is ultimately what got me past my disgust for his character, and even though he, and many of the characters are \"problematic\" at best. You learn that people are the products of their environment. The way we're raised, the environment we grow up in, and the decisions we make ultimately impact our actions. Watch it right through and you'll understand...\
Watch this show...I'm not even kidding. Be ready to ride the rollercoaster, to get emotional in some scenes and to challenge your typical with this psychologically thrilling, sometimes disturbing, mentally invigorating, funny, dramatic work. You will be entertained, there's a little bit of everything and you'll question the character's and their intentions quite abit.\
Thanks for reading this review and I hope you enjoyed it. \

    Some Spoilers Ensue:\
What a roller coaster this was. I was an emotional wreck going through the final 3rd of this anime and it was wonderful. The plot started as kind of a Battle Royale/Hunger Games type of thing, but quickly morphed into its own unique survival story. I was literally on the edge of my seat for this show. By the end, it was teetering at the top of the pain scale because every episode seemed to hurt worse than the last. I know it's hit or miss for a lot of people, but I really enjoyed the reveal and the ending. They foreshadowed early\
          \
        on by naming the time god Dues Ex Machina. You had to know it would be used as a plot device later on. In fact, a lot of times, I find this plot device to be contrived (as it's meant to be actually) but here, I felt strangely satisfied. It didn't cheapen it for me and I thought the finale was extremely emotional. My favorite episodes were 17 which painted a gorgeous backstory of two minor characters, and made them feel like they've been on the show since the beginning; and episode 22 because feelings (Akise is my favorite of the series). The diaries themselves were also interesting and unlike anything else I've seen. Overall, maybe there were a few plot holes towards the end, but the ride there was fulfilling and after I finished the show, I was left feeling like I watched something fresh, different, and amazing.\
Technically this was a treat also. The visuals in both opening and closing numbers were gorgeous as were all 4 of the songs. I loved the themes in this. The action scenes, as well as the romance were beautiful and the empty world was cool. Deus was awesome looking as well. The score music in this one was lovely and I want the soundtrack if you can't tell since I'm basically regurgitating everything I've said over again. I also really enjoyed the voice acting. Yukki's voice actor was perfection. \
The characters in this anime were another reason why I found it to be so successful. Each one had a personality and a reason behind their mayhem. Even minor ones like 12th and 8th had a distinct persona and it made you connect with them even if you didn't like them. I loved Mur Mur's little minisodes at the end of each episode because you didn't really get to know her during the actual show. The secondary characters (Akise, 9th, Nishijima, etc) were all some of my favorites, but the top of the top was definitely Yuno and Yukki. I loved Yuno, as evil and twisted as she was, she was an amazing yangere character. You felt love and hate towards her and you thought she was creepy, but wanted her to have her happy ending. It was just soooo good. And Yukki, through all his faults, his weaknesses and stupidity, I still loved him. He was nieve to the world, but I love when the characters have heart.\
Overall, I would watch it again and I recommend it highly but beware of the violence. I watched the uncensored one and it is bloody, but I would venture to say that if you've seen something like Attack on Titan, you can probably handle this one. Out of all the anime I've watched so far, this is one of my favorites for sure. 9.5/10.\

    Story\
The story was amazingly written. The story made this anime so unique, that it makes me feel it should have its own genre. The story is so confusing and unique, to me in every episode the story was so unpredictable I had no idea what was going to happen. To me, I felt like the story paced just fine. The elements of the story was finely done. Such as, the action it felt like there's was something insane  about the show. I only watched this show because my friend enjoys anime that have insane gore and killing in them. Well, the ending it wasn't\
          \
        good but neither was it bad. But after seeing the sequel OVA, it made my rating change from an 9 to a 10. I did this based off the guidelines ;3 ~hehe\
Art\
The art was photosynthesisly done. It was perfect the way it was made, I have no complaints about it because I don't particularly judge an anime by its graphics. The art was standard like in most anime produced in 2010 and beyond. The design of the characters matched them perfectly. The character designs weren't really unique or such but it was enough to tell the differences between who is who.\
Sound\
I don't have much to say how the characters sound because most anime have it perfectly aligned with the characters. The background music made the story 100% better such as having it play at the right time. The first theme song gave me a good vibe. I feel like I could listen to it even if I don't understand Japanese.\
Character\
The characters were distributed quite amazingly. It had the good and the bad. There was no one who was perfect in the anime. Just how a story wouldn't be interesting if everything went according to plan. Not any particular character was unnaturally strong, they were about the same. I think I will remember Yuno the most because she is very unique there aren't many characters that are yandere such as Yuno that's not what only makes her unique she wants everything to go her way, at first I thought she was just a greedy person but at the end it showed me that she really loves for the person she cares about.\
Enjoyment\
I think others might dislike it from the first episode such as, me. I thought it was just another anime about killing a few years back. But, I decided to check it out again and I feel so mad at myself for not watching this when it came out. I feel bad for people missing out an anime so good like this one. I think many people cried tears but I didn't I think I cried inside my heart though. ;)\
It would cause me too much pain to re-watch this series, I might go back for a few touching moments but that's all.\
If you truly read through all this, thank you. I just felt like writing this review because this anime is probably going to be the best anime I've ever watched. I wish you have a good day and watch this anime please! At least finish it and then you could judge it all you want! ~TOODLES \

Okay, well maybe not the most original, but im a sucker for survival games. I love how many plot twists there were, and how not one character is pitied. There were 12 contestants, each using a device that tells the future to survive. Heres the catch- if your diary is broken, then you die too. I dont usually like violence, but i feel that this series would not be the same without it.\

Enjoyment:10\
It was very entertaining. I loved how almost every character had a tragict past, and that it is shwon. I was a little confused at first, but evetually, everything makes sense. The plot twists were also amazing. If you are looking for comedy, dont watch this. It does not have any comedy, but maybe cruel humor.\
Characters:8\
To be honest, I didnt reqlly care for yuno. She creeped me out, and was crazy violent, but i got used to her, and when her past was revealed, I understood why she was so crazy. Yuki was one of the whiniest anime characters I have ever seen. He almost couldnt do anything by himself, and had yuno do everything. However, I liked his sudden personaloty change after SPOILER both his parents died. He wasnt hesitant to kill anyone ( except hos friends).",

    If there is one thing anime can get away with compared to other forms of entertainment is outlandish stories. Mirai Nikki is no exception and it has to be said the story is the weakest part of the series. The first half of the series is actually quite good but the second becomes a little ridiculous. \
However, I'm not going to write much of a review. I'm just talk about the situation Amano Yukiteru finds himself in. Yukiteru is one of those annoying cry-baby characters who is a bit of an outcast and find themselves in a situation where their always in extreme danger.\
Luckily for\
          \
        him a girl called Yuno is always there to protect him, even better she is in love with him. The price he pays for this though is that Yuno is an over protective to the point of being psychotic, killing anyone who gets close to him. \
I thought the best characters were the female characters. As well as the psychotic Yuno there is the equally unhinged head of an evil cult Sixth and my favourite the terrorist Ninth. Why is it all the best girl characters in anime are bad.\
To be honest without Yuno and Ninth Mirai Nikki may have sunk quite quickly after episode 13. Sadly Sixth wasn't in Mirai Nikki long enough.\
As I have written this I have come to realise that it has not come out as well as it was in my head, a little like the second half of Mirai Nikki. For that I can only apologise.\

    I have been meaning to write a review for Mirai Nikki, but I just have not gotten around to writing it. You might ask, \"Why?\", which coincidentally happens to be the same question I asked (several times actually) while watching this anime. Now, that's not to take anything away from the anime, but you will find yourself saying \"WTF did I just watch?\" especially near the end lol.\
Look, I know people will disagree with me, but I'm being honest when I say the anime isn't bad in fact its pretty decent except for a couple of areas.\
Story - 7\
Many people will score this low because\
          \
        of how it ended and the crazy roller-coaster of whatthefuckness that came along with it. However, I tried to analyze it based on the plot as a whole. The basis of the plot is very intriguing. You have the protagonist (I guess) who just happens to stumble upon the fact that he can tell what the future holds by reading his 'Future Diary'. What he finds out shortly after is that there are 11 others that have the same type of ability (more or less, it varies) and they must eliminate the others or be killed. That plot sounds really good and it is. I definitely enjoyed the first half or at least the first 15 episodes because of how well the story was developing. However, near the end of this storyline everything gets thrown together in a huge clusterfuck of \"I just figured out the answer right now, I totally didn't pull it out of my ass lol\" and \"I'm going to do things I've never done before nor know about just to confuse you\". It really throws everything off including the flow of the story...not in a good way.\
Art - 7\
Nothing too amazing, yet it wasn't bad. The action scenes were nice, most of the gore was censored so I don't know much about that. The thriller moments were executed nicely, you can see the facial expressions with ease.\
Sound - 9\
It's got a nice soundtrack including two really good opening pieces. One is by Faylan (named Dead End), which is really quite nice. It ties in with the art as well, just a great opening piece. It has great themes to fit each scene and they set the mood up each time. The voice actors or the Seiyuu are decent, the exception being the main character (lol), but I'll get around to that soon. Yuno's (Tomosa Murata) is great, I mean she's the best thing from this anime since she is the whole package. I'll explain more.\
Character - 8\
So your main character is Yukiteru Amano. Pretty much a pussy, that's all there is to say about him without going too far. He has his moments, but he's supposedly 14 so what do you expect? Alright next, the feature presentation, Yuno. She's the driving force of the plot and Yuki's life (or whatever). She's also fucking crazy. Honestly, when I started watching this I didn't understand WHY she was so attached to Yuki (She's a yandere by the way, not the exact opposite of a tsundere. More like a fucking crazy person attached to the protagonist) but now I understand. Essentially, to put it simply without creating too many loose ends she finds Yuki as the only person in her life and therefore is obsessed with him. She depends on him and uses him as a crutch, basically he supports her as a person and she can love him which keeps her crazy side at bay (but boy is she crazy). Other than that, you have your secondary characters, which have good development through mini arcs. My favourite (like many others) would be Minene. She's a cute badass, hehe.\
Enjoyment - 7\
Pretty good, but the end left a sour taste in my mouth. The ending was anticlimactic and although you may anticipate a wrap to all the events that doesn't happen. Other than the end, it was quite good. Lots of twists and turns throughout the storyline and it didn't get repetitive either like other plots similar to this one. All in all, a very good first half, but the conclusion weighed heavy on my overall enjoyment.\
Overall - 7\
I'm going to have to weigh the Story a little heavily than the rest and that's why it gets a 7 for me, but it really is a 7.5. I see people rating it 5 or 4 or whatever, personally I don't think it deserves a score such as that, but who am I to judge anyway. I can understand it because the ending is definitely frustrating, but it had the potential to be very good. If the main character was less of a bitch and more of a dude then it would have made it more enjoyable for sure. Nonetheless, I'm giving credit where credit is due, if you're into psychological/mental thrillers and don't mind some action avec gore then this might be your cup of tea. Just a warning: Whatever you think Yuno is, she's much worse, I've had several moments where I didn't think she would do that and then she did. That bitch cray.\

    Mirai Nikki is... Amazing. While talking to my non-anime watcher friends, we brought up a huge argument about whether hunger games was better than this show. Of couse i had my anime watcher friends to back me up  in convincing them that this show is the hunger games times 10. The way the plot is built around the use of \"future diaries\" is outstanding. I loved the show so much because its not just about killing and is alot deeper than i expected. The depth and use of the diaries definetly made this show a 10 for me.\

    Mirai Nikki is by far one of the best shows I have seen. Yuki Amano is a loner who spends most of his time writing a diary on his cell phone or talking with his imaginary friends Deus Ex Machina, the God of Time and Space; and Murmur, Deus' servant. One day, Deus gives Yuki a special diary, mentioning something about a game. Strangely, Yuki's new diary has entries in it spanning the next 90 days—entries about the future that come unnervingly true. Deus, the not-so-imaginary God of Time and Space, then forces Yuki to participate in a battle royale with eleven other people, each\
          \
        of whom also has a diary that can predict the future in some unique way. The rules of this \"Diary Game\" are simple: the contestants must try to find and kill all the other contestants before the world ends on Day 90, and only the last one standing can prevent the Apocalypse and become the new God of Time and Space. Yuki initially has no desire to win the game, but after Deus informs the other contestants that Yuki, as the \"1st\" Diary owner, is his favorite to win the game, he is forced to team up with the 2nd Diary owner—his obsessive stalker, Yuno Gasai—in order to survive the constant attempts on his life by the other diary users, who see him as the biggest threat. Although Yuki only feigns affection for Yuno to manipulate her into protecting him.\
The plot of the anime is very good. It has a somewhat of a \"gladiator feel\" to it. The plot twists in it are so close to M. Night Shyamalan's I almost shitted my pants. However, even if the plot twists are like M. Night Shyamalan's they are a lot better executed and make you want to keep watching the show. By far the greatest thing in the show is Yuno. Yuno fucking makes the show. She is the greatest Psycho bitch. I would so fuck the shit out of that yandere whore. WATCH IT!!!\

    I simply had to write a review for this anime because of how amazing it was. I'll try to keep my review as unbiased as possible and try to avoid any spoilers.\
Story-10\
This anime revolves around the theme of romance. Whats added is layer upon layer of suspense, thrills and action. What really lets this anime shine is the intricacy of the plot. What I really liked is that they didn't just give everyone super powers and say kill each other, rather they gave each individual a simple power, to be able to read the future, and with it came infinite possibilities, strengths and weaknesses. Yes\
          \
        you heard me right weaknesses. Beneath all this turmoil is one of the best romance stories ever told. About how love can throw one into the depths of despair as well as grant them salvation.\
Art-9\
The art in this anime is pretty good. Not the best, but still far above average. The characters facial expressions are really well done and their emotions are well conveyed especially Yuno's.\
Sound-10\
Although I didn't really enjoy either of the opening songs, I must agree that they reflect the chaos that ensues. The background music is what really earns this field a 10, its really able to bring out the intensity in every scene.\
Character-10\
This is perhaps one of the greatest anime in terms of the abundance of character personalities it brings with it.  Yuki is the main protagonist of the series, and for the most part he's a pansy, being indecisive, running from conflict and always depending on others. He does however have a good side to him as well. Gasai Yuno is what this anime is all about. She is just a melange of different emotions, switching from one to the next at the flip of a coin. Her personality in lieu of a better word is 'unique' and keeps you guessing whats actually going on in her mind. To be able to make an audience feel for a psychopathic yandre running amok with a knife at hand is no small feat. Yuno is center of the whole series and the one you should keep your eyes on.\
Enjoyment-10\
You never know what Yuno is going to do next. And the series has its fair share cute and fluffy romantic scenes along with a lot action and suspence. I must give you a fair warning, if you cant take extreme violence, then this may not be the anime for you. For everyone else however, it is one hell of a roller coaster ride.\
Overall-10\
My favorite anime by far. Unique in every sense of the word and well worth the watch.\

    Hmmm... Mirai Nikki... This Anime was definitely one which required some thought after finishing. Though am I thankful I went through the Episodes to reach that conclusion.\
As you will all have seen from the Synopsis Yuki is a boy who is placed in a Survival game with 11 other Diary owners. To win the game he must kill all the others. One of the diary owners however ( Second ) Is Yuno Gasai, Personally my favourite character though very Yandere.\
To say Yuno happens to like Yuki is an understatement. But no spoilers so I will not go into further detailing on that. Just know that\
          \
        the evolution of these 2 Characters is very key and is also one of the most enjoyable I have seen. \
The Story was very well done with links in all the right places and drops where there needed to be drops. Though the only thing that makes the story a 9 For me would be the middle arc, which I shall not spoil, It is just confusing slightly and a little Unexplained. \
The Characters are all very varied and the personalities of all the Diary owners you meet and their matching Diaries was a very nice touch indeed. \
Overall I was torn between 9/10 and 10/10 because though it is hard to understand in someplaces. It is an amazing tale that has an ending which Brought tears to my eyes... Hmmm...\

    Never have I wanted to side with protagonists who couldn't be more crazy to do what they are doing. And yet, no matter how disturbing or weak our protagonists act, I easily forgive them or keep telling them to man up and get out there.\
I was recommended this anime and took no time in knowing what I was getting into...I thought it would be a cute romance. That's how much I knew. Turns out...I got a bit more than I bargained for. Episode 1 had me interested. Episode 3 had me needing to watch the rest immediately.\
There are some interesting strengths here. First (and not\
          \
        really a story) the idea of people working against each other with diaries from the future is very well executed. Yeah, the idea itself you can poke holes into, but don't be so uptight! No, I couldn't read something quick enough to dodge a bullet but that's not the point...it's gets a bit more complicated as situations present themselves. Our protagonists and anti-heroes Yuno and Yuki are not exactly typical of your high premise anime...\
*SPOILER ZONE BEGIN*\
What's interesting is you typically don't get protagonists that keep failing you and yet you want to root them on...Yuno is adorable...and completely psychotic. Then when she does something completely unforgivable, you forgive her because she's so cute...yet she's psychotic. Yuki is...well, a beta male loner that you wonder why you care so much that he should overlook all these terrible things. Then when he does, you wonder why can he accept it.\
*SPOILER ZONE END*\
That's what makes Mirai Nikki so compelling...everyone is doing awful things and yet everyone has a moment where you realize they are fighting for something. It puts you in a dilemma, not in a typical anti-hero sort of way, but more so...while you judge someone for the decisions they make, you can sit in judgement of yourself why you wonder why people aren't doing the amoral things you want them to do. \
Probably the main drive to the story is the continual turns (I am specifically not using twists here) to really punctuate the story. You learn straight from episode 3 that this will not unfold the way you will expect. And that makes getting to the end a curiosity which is the best anyone can ask for.\
Pros:\
Excellent pace for developing characters so you really understand their motivations in a rather simple premise. It makes the whole series more compelling to watch. \
Takes all 'adult' aspects very seriously. I enjoy fanservice, sure...but it can set a tone that would probably knock this show down a notch. It's not gratuitous with its use which just adds to the atmosphere. An appreciated respect. \
Cons:\
In many ways I actually admire the subtlety in Yuki's character developing, but since we already have that in an unstable character I would've like to have seen more diversity in Yuki like a roller coaster...like opposites between expectations of who Yuno and Yuki become...Yuki's changes are a bit hard to believe.

    All i can say about this anime is........WAO! oh and yeah warning, there is A LOT of mindf*cking. \
STORY- 10) I might as well give you all a little more info on the show then what the Synopsis has to say. As Deus (God of space and time) is aging, he had set up this contest for 12 players. They each recieve what is called a \"Future Diary\" which always can tell the future, or so it seems. There are diffeent diaries, the random diary, escape diary, love diary, etc. Each player has to either kill or destroy another players diary (which kills them) Last\
          \
        man, or woman, standing becomes god! Sounds pretty cool right? haha you're sure right about that. There are SOO many plot twists and climatic moments that you end up on the edge of your seat going \" WHAT THE F*UCK JUST HAPPENED!?!?!?!!??\" Throughout the story there are so many twists and turns that you are just so excited to see what will happened next. The story really has a lot of different side stories so you might get confused, but by the end i guarantee that you will be like \"....dude\" breathless, when everything comes together it kits you like a wall of bricks.\
ART- 10) The art is very nice in this show. Im not going to go on forever so don't worry. But you can tell the emotion of the characters faces as clear as day. The art shows all the love, and pain, the character is going through.\
SOUND - 9) Not much to say here also. The music for the opening and end credits is *eh. But during the show the songs always matches the scenes perfecty. But ther is no music during the fight scenes and the climatic scenes which is great use you can really pay attention to the show more.\
CHARACTER- 10) Now this is my favorite part of the show. Each character is developed AMAZINGLY throughout the story. Especially Yuukii (the main male character) coming out a shy, pathetic, un-manly loser into a lean mean killing machine! He turns out to be quite the lead. But there are still times where you saw what he did and your like \"WHAT THE F*CK ARE YOU DOING YOU PIECE OF SH*T!\" and \"You are suh a freakin COWARD!\" but don't worry, he turns out to be a great character. Then there is Yuno, all i have to say is....DAMN GIRL! She is a loveing, stalking,  psycopathic killing bad ass. She has more skill then anyone and is just plain out incredible. She grows to have a crush on Yuuki and literally has been stalking him for a year prior to when the game started. She has the Yuuki Diary, so she can STALK HIM EVEN MORE NOW! But she saves him sooo much and tries to do whats best for him. You will be wondering if she loves him or is just plain crazy, maybe a bit of both. All the other characters develope nicely throughout the story.\
ENJOYMENT- 9) like i said i LOVED this anime. You will be on the edge of your seat just waiting to see what will happen next. You will laugh, maybe cry, bite your fingernails down to the num, drop your jaw, and maybe spaze out haha.\
OVERALL- 10) One of the best shows with honestly one of the coolest and tricked out plots of all time. Definately see it anyone who is even considering it.\

    I'm basic man, I don't look for much in terms of anime or TV shows.\
I'm not major in literature or anything fancy.\
However, that aside I will do my best to convey how this anime made me feel.\
I can't predictability or characters that take themselves too seriously. You're not gonna find any basic characters like that here.\
From episode 1 to 26 my eyes were glued to the screen trying to capture everything these drawn creations did or say. The plot will grab you and drag you in deeper and deeper I couldn't predict what was going on but I was excited to see what happened next.\
I'm\
          \
        just gonna say the sound and art quality were great, they weren't straight out  Misaki film but I couldn't complain, and neither will you.\
To just quickly summerize this before my microwave dinner finishes, \
This is about a game where the objective is to kill the other players. Each player has a unique ability through their cell phone.\
Main character is the classic high school teenager that just has no special qualities. \
He has his psycho crush girl friend, who just loves it when this dude gets hit on by other females, making this drama fueled.\
You have your blood, dark ass plot twists and a HUGE plot twist ending which had me searching discussion threads trying to find more to appease my questions of \"what the fuck!?\"\

    Mirai Nikki or Future Diary is a psychological survival type anime with the focus on two characters, namely; Amano Yukiteru and Gasai Yuno, these two try to survive in a game they are dragged in, though that is not all, the winner of this game will be the next God of Time and Space.\
With psychological anime it is to the viewers most of the times a hit or miss, as seen in the reviews of others, a low scoring review will be down-voted by its hardcore fans, and a high scoring review will be down-voted by its non-fans. But that is all small talk, this\
          \
        anime's main selling point is the atmosphere it gives in each tense situation, and you look at the story from the eyes and thoughts of the protagonist. Can I trust her? Will he be betray me? Those are the thoughts of our protagonist, so for an psychological anime, it has done that part really well, not much anime can keep such a feeling while not letting it get boring.\
Obviously no anime is perfect and Mirai Nikki is no exception, to keep telling an interesting tale while not being a bit confusing is hard, and Mirai Nikki was not able to make every viewer understand, you can say that it tried to be too clever, towards the end things get rather tangled up with each other, and the result leaves with a confusing lead up toward the end of the anime.\
Action-wise, it has done good, but not much more, seeing overprotective middle school girls or yandere to the experts swinging around a katana or firing a gun stays one of the more awkward things to see. The death of characters is done well, not too sudden, but not that you can see it coming fairly soon. Surprising, but subtle is how you can sum it up.\
Art-wise it is not too amazing, the character designs are not amazing, especially if you look at something which is supposed to be a god, this could have been portrayed better. In terms of animation it has done quite well, no skippy animating, and they probably did their best with the budget they got.\
Mirai Nikki's theme was creepy and very tense and it has done well with it opening themes, these maintain the theme of the anime and didn't bring you out of the mood, you can see that seiyuu wise they might have put less money in this department, every voice actor is less known, not that this matters, what matters is how well they match their character. This is done surprisingly well, Yuno's VA has the voice of an over-obsessed girl, while Yukiteru's VA also has the voice of a lonely, slightly pathetic middle school guy.\
Characters, in numbers it has the perfect amount for a season lengthy anime, it has two main characters which creates for lots of development, and this could be called this anime's second flaw, its development. Once somebody decides to do something they should not revert back. Yukiteru has made decisions only to not follow them up, this could be part of that he is supposed to have a somewhat pathetic personality, but if you decide to do it, then revert, and later decide to do it again, it wastes time and interest of its viewers. \
On the other hand, Gasai Yuno, the over-obsessed girl/yandere of the series has been done to perfection, she has been the main talking point of this anime, and maybe even its selling point, the creation of yandere is simple, you add creepy with moe, but this time the basics has been done so well, although she is a main character, she does not have a lot of development. And that is not needed neither, she was already done with developing in the beginning of the series, which has reasons explained in the anime itself. \
In a survival anime there are lots of deaths needed, these get shoved to the supporting characters and sometimes to the main characters as well, the line-up of supporting characters is variable and of interesting personalities.\
Overall I thought Mirai Nikki was a good anime, it had a classic survival plot with some strong characters.\
Strong points:\
- Good concept and interesting story.\
- Sound-wise it was very strong as well.\
- It had some amazing characters, female MC and supporting characters were exceptionally good.\
Weak points:\
- A lot of time and viewer's interest wasted on the protagonist and his \"development\".\
- Not so outstanding art, could have had better character designs.\
- It sometimes was too confusing, could be explained better.\
So if you like survival with some good characters set around middle school aged kids and don't mind blood and gore, then Mirai Nikki is the anime for you.\

    Okay, for those who are reading, this is a positive review...I'm going to be as objective as possible, but I really enjoyed Mirai Nikki, and hope this (rather long) review will motivate you to watch this awesome piece.\
Story: 9/10\
The story had a fresh concept: a battle royale where 12 people with \"Future Diaries,\" diaries that can predict the future, fight to become the god of their world. Each diary had its strengths and weaknesses, which meant that the fight that ensued was unpredictable and kept you anticipating each and every character's next move. You were left to anticipate what ways our main characters, Amano Yukiteru\
          \
        and Gasai Yuno, would use to outsmart the other diary users. In addition, altough some characters were killed off quite abruptly, a lot of the more important scenes were done very well, flooding the viewer with a lot of emotion, often bringing them on the verge of tears.\
Art: 7/10\
I'm not a very artistic person, but I felt that the art was quite average. However, the anime sometimes surprised me by providing unexpectly well-drawn and detailed scenes, which surely cannot hurt your enjoyment of the anime.\
Sound: 8/10\
I think the OP and ED were appropriate and the soundtrack did a good job of conveying the mood of each situation. It was pretty subtle, but you could still feel it's presence and it amplified the particular mood every time.\
Character: 10/10\
I think character development was where Mirai Nikki really shined.\
The main characters were Amano Yukiteru, a shy boy who always acted as a bystander, and Gasai Yuno, who is obsessed with Yuki. However, unlike your expectations, these two were not necessarily the protagonists of the series. Although they were the main characters, their actions were not necessarily good and often blurred the line between good and evil. In Mirai Nikki no one was really evil (well, except one). As the anime provides the back stories to each character, you will begin to see that these characters were not affected by evil motives, but rather, were affected by their hurtful past. Each character's back story demonstrates every evil of man you can possibly think of, jealousy, hate, violence, lust, and many others. This helped you sympathize with each and every character, and as I said before, brought forth a lot of emotional scenes.\
Enjoyment/ Overall: 10/10\
With its great characters and plot that was full of twists and turns, Mirai Nikki successfully delivers. I was constantly kept on the edge of my seat, and was brought close to tears more often than ever before. The deep characters, and their emotionally touching back stories enrich the plot, helping you get more and more involved in the storyline. Even until the end, I was constantly kept on the edge, and the ending was hands down, was the most touching and beautiful scene I had ever seen. Mirai Nikki not only provides you with a good piece of mystery/ thriller, but provides you with a lot of emotional drama as well, making it one of the best thriller anime out there.\
(This was my first review. I would appreciate any feedback (even if you didn't like it) on how I can make it better. Thank you for taking your time to read my review)\

       At first glance, this show appears to be nothing more than an anime where the idea of a battle royal runs rampant. Though Mirai Nikki shows heavy elements of that idea, it turned out to be something more. \
   Story - The story in this series is absolutely amazing. In my opinion, the plot was complex, with many twists and turns which would always leave the viewer in suspense. The story depicts a unsociable teenager named Yukiteru Amano. Yukiteru is your average fourteen year old with abandonment issues. To add insult to injury, Yuno Gasai is a\
          \
        mysterious girl, a stalker that is obsessed with the protagonist. In Mirai Nikki, the show revolves around them and how they cope with the survival game, but they soon find out the tragic fate that will soon behold them.\
   Characters - The characters in Mirai Nikki showed exceptional potential and I was right. All the characters play a special part in the game, they all have their reasons for winning. The most popular character is obviously Yuno, with her obsessive tendencies. From what I see, Yukiteru is a hated character due to his cowardice, indecisiveness, and naivety. One could even say that if he was removed from the story, the survival game can still go on due to his reliance on Yuno. However, I believe that he is a great character. When you think about it, he has his reasons for his weaknesses. He is fourteen years old, he is a naive loner, and to top it all off he has a mysterious and perhaps insane girl stalking him every moment of his life. Overall, the characters were very appealing, contributing to the story exactly what they needed to. 10/10\
   Sound - This is one of the elements that made me grow to love this series. The openings and endings both match with the concept of this anime. The first ending was my favorite especially. The background music in each episode always match with the situation the protagonists are in. The voice actors also compliment the characters they play. 10/10\
   Art - The art is decent compared to other anime series of the 2011-2012 timespan. Honestly, the art is mediocre at best when compared to animes released in the same dates such as Guilty Crown. The character designs were normal, I did not find it good nor bad. The only character designs that appealed to me were those of Yuno, Yukiteru, and Minene. They looked like how their personalities would make them appear to be. 8/10\
   Enjoyment - I enjoyed watching Mirai Nikki. The complex storyline was what got me in the end. I will be watching this again someday in the future. To whoever that would like to watch this anime, there are heavy elements of violence and gore. Overall, I am proud to say that Mirai Nikki is the best anime I have watched during it's 2011-2012 airing time. Anime series such as Mirai Nikki are kind of anime that I look forward to every year. Perhaps there will be another in 2012.  10/10\
   Extra - There are many uses of symbolism in this series. Perhaps it is my own belief, but Mirai Nikki displays many actions of the characters which mean something I believe that is deeper than the storyline intends to show us. I'd hate to give spoilers, but the last episode uses symbolism extremely well to draw the viewer in. The anime also displays many traits of human nature. I might sound too deep right now but Mirai Nikki shows the virtues of devotion, love, human kindness, and acceptance. Yes, I enjoyed the anime that much to think about this.\
   Overall - I was very pleased with this show. Along with the gore and violence, there are also many tragic events which accompany the storyline. Towards the end, you will understand what I mean by that. So in conclusion, Mirai Nikki is a must watch, I highly recommend it. I will not forget Mirai Nikki and will look forward to it's \"Next Project\".\

    What makes for a good start does not necessarily end well.\
This series is a shining example to that phrase.\
As it has probably been said hundredfold or more, the main protagonist can (and will) be perceived as bothersome, weepy, liitle punk and could spoil a great deal of initial anime's eps.\
Wish I could say it was only a front...\
Putting that aside though, the second (how symbolic here) main character makes up for it with more than intrest.\
The series starts in a very simillar manner to the one in Death Note, and by my assesment can be put very close to it. The question is, if on\
          \
        an equal footing as well?\
Well, that depends on the viewer optics on certain plot moves really.\
Its got its moments, and final episodes skyrockets the tempo, but...\
Let the 'but' be a mystery here, up for an individual evaluation.\
Post scriptum \
Few twists seems a little far-fetched, to say the least. \
But in the end the sum makes for more than a decent story.\

    So, here's the thing about Mirai Nikki: it packs an interesting, solid central premise, some genuinely thrilling moments, and some really pretty animation. But that's not why you want to watch it. \
At the risk of oversimplification, the real draw is the character of Gasai Yuno, and her dynamic with the main character. It's not an exaggeration to call Yuno one of the most compelling anime characters to come along in a long while. Playing the 'crazy murderous stalker' as the only real ally is a stroke of genius, and moments where she's unleashed are unforgettable. \
That being said, Mirai Nikki suffers from some uneven\
          \
        plotting, some really baffling tonal changes, and some filler. The show ricochets between deadly serious murder games and happy moe comedy at the most bizarre moments, ruining any sustained tension. Some stock music also frustrates in moments of terror. \
Granted, none of these gripes are giant, awful problems, but they are a definite detriment to Mirai Nikki, which is a shame, because when the show works, it knocks it out of the park. \
If only it were a little more consistant. As it stands, Mirai Nikki is a solid thriller that has a great character to keep you watching when the story drags.\

    Frankly, I didn't start watching this anime, even then I read synopsis and reviews, but I'm really glad that one day I thought \"Why not?\". I'm not the fan of thrillers, but this anime still was able to hold my attention for several days. If there wasn't the study in university, I would watch it in just one day, from morning to midnight. So why \"Mirai Nikki\" got under my skin? Well, there are several reasons.\
Synopsis gives basic understanding of story and seems like usual anime plot with idea of battle royale. The fight of twelve players for becoming new God of Time and Space\
          \
        has many tense moments because of their diaries, constantly predicting future. That only gives many advantages for developing story. And trust me, they are properly used.  Furthermore, there are some questions about Deus Ex Machina and the diaries. All that helped story to hold interest with grip of steel.\
But story not only revolves around battles, there is still place for characters with their peculiarities. Characters not just actors playing their fixed roles, they are able to go beyond archetypes if there is a serious reason. There are enough situations that force they to go against own opinion, but this has some consequences and affects on their personality. But the most interesting is different levels and types of insanity amongst characters, which make story twists really unexpected and tense. You will be stunned by some actions of characters, but you still will be able to understand their reasons. That is my main point of interest in this anime.\
You may ask, “So why not 10 for story and characters?”. Well, that’s more subjective matter. If you like psychological thrillers, then just think that I ranked everything by ten. But I judged this anime independently of it genre and didn’t paid attention to specifics of “psychological thrillers”. I don’t like completely dark atmospheres, where is no place for happiness without pain. After “Mirai Nikki” I was in bad mood and hopefully it didn’t last long. But nevertheless, minus one point for that.\
Music is very good and completely matches the scenes, without making phony tension. Mix of electronics with some classis elements and even Eastern motives. Some even made their way to my playlist. But this is true about music in episodes, not opening and ending.\
Frankly, I’m not the type, watching anime because of art, but I haven’t seen any mistakes or can blame “Mirai Nikki” for bad visual style.\

    I myself give this series a 10/10...but critique wise I am going to \"downgrade\" it to a 9/10 because just like almost every anime..there is one flaw that hurts it.\
I am not going to lie, it took me several episodes to actually get into watching and therefore, was a mediocre priority. But once I got through that barrier..I was pleasantly surprised. I was sort of knocked off of my feet after a few episodes of the main character with the secondary (Gasai Yuno). The way the producers of both the manga and the anime portray her are brilliant and fascinating. Once you watch this series,\
          \
        Yuno will more than likely become your favorite of the series, and possibly even on your top list of favorites.\
I give the character development a 9/10 for one reason...it can be a tad confusing keeping track of the numbers of the people and which ones hold true to the title given (aka Yukki is \"First.\") Along with the fact that throughout the entire anime I wanted to punch Yukki in the face...this happens with many anime however his stubbornness almost drove me up a wall.\
I just typed this up to maybe answer a few wanted questions to those thinking about viewing it....many people compare this to Death Note...however I couldn't truly make any comparisons either than the \"wanting to be god\" scheme. If you do not fancy violence than I would not even consider watching this as that is the gist of the plot...thanks for reading!!\

Mirai Nikki is a school life anime, using different elements of genres to make this anime unique, the characters are incredible, the story is very unique the supernatural side of it is in the name, Future diaries is a brilliant idea for an anime I find the whole idea of having a diary that tells the future incredible.\
The action is mind blowing, the whole idea of using tactics with the future diary and how it can be used as either a strength or a weakness, that is one of the main things I love about this anime.\

        that are chosen by the God of the world Dues to be diary owners, the idea is that the last one standing is chosen to take over Deus’ role as God. \
The two main characters are the first and second diary owners, Yuki and Yuno, Yuki is a shy defenceless teenager that doesn’t seem to want to talk to many people, he calls himself an observer  as from the start of the anime you can see him constantly writing a diary on his phone on his surroundings. Instead of having real friends he has created himself what he believes is an imagination which is realm of Deus and Murmur.\
Yuno is the second diary owner, she is a beautiful young women who has created an obsession with Yuki as her future diary is completely revolved around Yuki. She is very protective of Yuki as her love for him has been very certain ever since Yuki made a joking promise to her that he will marry her one day, this creates the fixation that Yuno has for Yuki creating a romance between the two giving the anime an incredible romance aspect inside the anime.\
There is a strong psychological aspect inside the anime, some bits of it are admittedly very creepy. Yuno is definitely my entirely favourite character in the entire anime, she has so much to bring into the anime, there is two sides to her and that is what I love. There is a soft sweet loving and very protective side to Yuno and there is also a psycho stalker side to her that will do anything to make sure the safety of Yuki.\
There is two main types of horror inside this anime, they both mix incredibly in different moment, for example there is moments of rape but also moments of intense suspense within fights of diary owners.\
The action is absolutely phenomenal, the explosion and weapon  effects are incredible and the blood effects are quite shocking. Yuno is the main aspect of gore in the anime, she shows multiple moments of slaughtering and there is many moments where we see Yuno covered in blood and the psycho stages that Yuno goes through when she sees Yuki come to harm.\
Also I love how the future diaries are used in the core combat between diary owners, the first time you see this is in the first episode as Yuki and Yuno use their diaries to locate the position of the third diary owner which was closely followed by a dart to the thirds diary completely destroying it. This resulted in a strange death for the third as it seemed his entire body was scrunched up and eventually sucking into an oblivion. \
The thing I love most about this anime is how much I fell in love with the characters, Yuno is one of my personal favourite anime characters of all time, she is just perfection and Katsuhiko deserves incredible credit for creating this amazing character.\
*THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION CAN BE CLASSED AS A SPOILER*\
The ending of the anime was a true tear jerker, just to know how much Yuno’s love for Yuki truly meant to her, the end fights were incredible as you could seriously see how the ninth diary owner changed from a blood thirsty killer to attempting to help in the fight against Murmur, the powers of Yuno were incredible, you discover what her true colours are and instead of spoiling it for people who haven’t seen it, I will just say the ending will definitely surprise anyone who watches this anime.",

    I absolutely loved Mirai Nikki. I was constantly on the edge of my seat, hitting \"next epsiode\" one after the other.\
The story line is quite unique, and like I said, I was always wanting to know what would happen next. Mirai Nikki is full of surprises: betrayals, loyalties, choices, and love. I was always shocked or surprised, as nothing in the story could be predicted.\
I loved the artwork, it is very similar to the art work in Deadman Wonderland (as were the characters). The characters, Yuno and Yuki, resembled Shiro and Ganta, and the relationships between the pairs were also quite similar. All the characters\
          \
        were very unique in their own way, and I can guarantee you will become attached to many, if not all, of the characters.\
I enjoyed every second of this anime. I was hooked from the beginning and loved it until the end. The violence, the story, the characters, the relationships, the twists, and the fact that it was all so unpredictable, were every reason I couldn't stop watching.",

    For some reason there appears to be quite a few negative reviews for the overall good rating of this show.  In my opinion, this is the single best anime that I have seen.  Sure the plot may be a little out there but that is what keeps the story fresh and exciting.  Every single episode adds a new twist and things get better and better the whole way through.  If you are a fan of things such as Death Note, the Zero Escape series, and other psychological thrillers, I would highly recommend this anime.  Also, cross your fingers for an\

    Hello, citizens of MAL. This is my first review so...yeah. It is a review best recieved by people who have already viewed the anime...\
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS...\
Firstly, I'd like to say that I began watching this series I don't know how many months ago. The plot was intriguing, the characters that they had introduced were interesting: Yuno being mysterious, Yukiteru being reserved blah blah blah...\
Something about it attracted me. The concept of the future diaries was alluring to me. \
Then after watching episode 15 I stopped. Why did I stop you ask? Why did I abandon the anime I had been somewhat intrigued by? I'll\
          \
        tell you why. Because the main characters were unbearable. Let's start with our protagonist. Yukkii. He is somewhat clever, very reserved, and extremely weak. I would have liked to see some character development from him throughout the show...but alas, I could get none until episode 24/25? \
[this show has 26 episodes (and an OVA which I will address later)]\
Basically Yuno is intensely obsessed with Yukiteru. She loves him. When the future diary game starts and all the owners learn that there can only be one left, Yuno vows to protect Yukkii at all costs, which was understandable..she LOVES him. And what does Yukkii do? He accepts is and uses her. He shows little to no affection her way. He just uses her. And for those who are saying that he's just a boy and he's scared and all this other stuff..stop for a second and think. \
There's a beautiful girl that's in love with him and she would do anything to protect you. And you show no sign of wanting to protect her. Yes, Yukki probably liked Yuno to an extent but there was no real love or genuine emotion coming from him. That said this kid cries....A LOT. If you don't like a main protagonist that cries a gallon of tears every episode then don't watch this anime. Just saying...\
But anyway Yukki shows absolutely no drive to help or care for Yuno and it is illustrated beautifully (and tragically) in episode 15.\
There are two other diary owners (the two 7ths who are a couple that are very much in love). They are after Yukki and Yuno (the 1st and 2nd). \
When Yukki and Yuno are forced to face the 7s the 7s announce that it is \"a battle of couples\" or something like that saying that \"they had to love each other more to win\" and it was a battle of love. So the two sevens are prepared to fight side by side. And Yukki is prepared to sit back and watch Yuno fight them. Long story short 2 against 1 isn't a good bet and Yuno falls to the ground unconscious. The male 7 goes up to Yukiteru, picks him up one-handed, and says \"Why didn't you come and save your girl? A real man would've jumped into the fire to save his girl!\". He's pissed at Yukki, as was I. Yukki then goes on a rather depressing rant on how he's pathetic and he knows it and he's weak and you guessed it...he cries like a schoolgirl.\
Then one of my favorite moments of the show begins. \
The male 7 looks at Yukki in disgust and says \"Just die.\", throwing Yukki over the rail. \
So that's Yukki in a nutshell for 92% of the series. \
Yuno on the other hand, while brave, brutal, and blunt, is doing everthing for Yukki. So you have a main character that sucks and another that is better but is completely obsessed and in love with the character that sucks. Also, I want to mention his strange connection with his dad only a few days after he killed his mom. Yukkii isn't really mad..he seems bothered but not ready to even punch the guy in the face...this bothered me SO MUCH. he was even ready to forgive him right before his dad was killed...WHAT THE HECK.\
Now to briefly talk about the other characters. \
What is 8th. Just...what.\
Akise is one of the best characters: smart, intuitive.\
Kousaka: comic relief, kind of an ahole, aight though\
Hinata: not bad\
Mao: not bad, lesbian tendencies provided a little comic relief. meh.\
7s: the best characters of the show. I'd like to spend an entire review on just them and their story but I can't. ups and downs, twists and turns...amazing, unforgettable characters...and they don't get enough screen time...\
11th: overpowered. no.\
Yukki's dad: kind of dbag....\
Yukki's mom: nice, caring, the typical anime mom, let's face it she's a joy to have around\
Yuno's parents: ugh.\
And now that I've spent most of this review talking about Yukki, I'd love to get onto other things. This show actually explores a lot of themes and ideas that I liked. The dimensional jumping, although a little difficult to follow at first, isn't so bad, and the way Ninth and Akise had a larger role in the show than we thought was pretty cool. I also would like to mention one of my other top moments of the show. It was when Deus was prepared to erase Akise from existence. After failing to name one thing that he did of his own free will, Akise starts to dissolve, and he does briefly. That gave me chills. Anyway back to the plot. Basically it was sort of all over the place but the OVA (Mirai Nikki: Redial) redeemed the show's depressing ending. \
So that's my very lopsided review. Um. Thanks..ok. yeah. ",

    Mirai Nikki, a heart wrenching anime. This is the type of anime that changes the way you look at things.\
Story - 9/10\
I really liked the concept of this anime and the story. Although I didn't cry even though I felt I should -- I couldn't stop thinking that Yuno was a psycho. But overall I really did enjoy the story of this anime.\
Art - 7/10\
Usually being the un-observant person that I am, I don't notice the art so this anime I rate it alright. Nothing stuck out to me as bad yet as good.\
Sound - 6/10\
I usually don't notice anything about the sound unless its\
          \
        fantastic and sadly Mirai Nikki is one of those anime. However, after doing a bit of research I have come to love Track 5 which is incredible. \
Characters - 7/10\
My favourite character was Minene Uryu, she was a very different character I have never seen before. She was first an antagonist and then a protagonist. The problem I have with characters is that till the very end I couldn't forget that Yuno is a psycho but then again it is very difficult for me to change my mind. \
Enjoyment- 9/10\
Mirai Nikki is one of my favourite anime and I enjoyed it very much.\
Overall - 9/10\
I really enjoyed Mirai Nikki and made it to my favourite anime list. This anime was very amazing. However I don't remember a lot about it hahaha the consequence of watching so much in a short period of time. Each character had their own reasons and story and it was a very deep anime. Teaching you about many life experiences and wisdom. Man, it was very deep and forever Mirai Nikki will have a place in my heart. \

    Dear Diary, mood apathetic. JUST JOKING.\
Anyway, this anime was a bit enjoyable. It is about Yuki writing a diary on his cell phone or talking to his imaginary friends Deus ex Machina & Murmur, Deus' servant. Deus ex Machina is the God of time and space who brought Yuki to the survival game whereby the last man alive in this game is the winner. Yuno was also brought it to help Yuki. Yuno was actually in love with Yuki and will do anything for his sake. The rest of the contestants are thrown in also.\
This survival game reminds me of the show I watched \"Liar\
          \
        Game\" whereby deception is the rule of the game. In fact, this anime is full of deceptions like in episode 7, Reisuke tries to kill them by using his dirty tricks but failed. \
Deception means deceiving or cheating one another. It will be quite difficult to understand people's intentions but Yuno was able to judge them quickly and protected Yuki from such harm caused.\
Yuki was an insecure boy who reminded me of Shinji Ikari, a person who couldn't defend himself and cries a lot. He annoyed me to no end.\
Yuno was a badass but a yandere. At least she's cool but creepy at the same time.\
Ururu was also a badass. She sort of reminds me like Revy from Black Lagoon.\
Some of the characters are interesting like Marco & Tsubaki. Their characters are interesting.\
\
But anyway, it was a great ride through different times and worlds just like the movie in \"The Girl who Leapt through time\" whereby Makoto Konno reverses the time so that things migth go the way she wants it to be.\
\
The art was inconsistent at parts where they cut out certain details but overall decent and my favorite music is the first opening of the song \"Kuso Mesorogiwi\" an epic opening which I won't get bored after listening to it.\
Actually, I really liked the way how the characters relate to one another even when Yuki understands that Yuno helps him in his way. Yuki at least he showed some bravery in the final scene when he overcame his fear. The problem is there was not enough world exploration on how the world existed and how they got transported into different worlds.\
I do believe that this anime is worth watching for those who have not watched and get ready for deceptions, battles and exciting worlds to come. \
I give this show an 7/10.\

    Once in a while an anime comes along and blows your expectations for it out of the water. Mirai Nikki is definitely one of those animes.\
Note:\
If you go into this anime with low expectations for it, or expectations derived from the Manga alone, you're at a good starting point. \
The story is easy enough to follow, and the tiny synopsis and further explanations given by the chibi character \"Murmur\" at the end of some episodes will help clue you in on some of the questionable occurrences in the series. Be sure not to miss those.\
A brief plot summary:  \
Yukki is a high school boy\
          \
        who maintains an indiscriminate diary of everything he observes. One day he is gifted with a \"Future Diary\" (his indiscriminate diary, only now it automatically records the days happenings in advance for him) by the god of space and time \"Deus\". He finds out that there are other diary holders, each with their own unique abilities whom he must kill. The victor will become the next god of space and time. \
Review:\
The story is well developed and thought out, with plot twists frequently. More than enough to keep you entertained throughout the entire series.  the character development for the main characters is well done and thorough, though on some of the lesser characters it leaves a bit to be desired. \
The art is detailed and enticing, and blends to the mood changes very well. The character color schemes are nice and reminiscent of the color schemes used in the Creator's other title; \"Deadman Wonderland\".\
As for the intro and opening; I thought the intro fit very well, the song was nice and mood fitting. The ending, however I found kind of lazy and very unfitting, the song was also generic, and just over all a pile of blah to me. \
The main character, Yukki, is pretty flat and whiny. He whines at every turn, and always has a chaotic good character complex. This is, however, made up for with the complexity of the other characters, such as Yuno and Number 9.\
The character relations were well thought out and well placed. \
\
This anime definitely has re-watch value, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys \"darker\" anime. \

    This anime is epic, but still, i prefer the manga version of it. There are some scenes that are different from the manga, like how Yuno kills 11th. The story resolves in some people which writes diary on their phone/drawing books or to record it and granted a power to foreseen the future... and they have to kill each other until there's only one diary owner left who will become the new God and replace the current Deus Ex Machina.\
In the end, i still wanted to recommend this anime to all of you who read this review. It's worth watching and or reads the manga.\

    I dont want to sound like a fanboy and simply praise this series so i took time to analyze this anime an tell you whats good,bad and if its worth your time.also im not gonna talk about what the story is about since its better to watch it then to be told about it,ok with that said:first off the good of the storyline,its nothing short of amazing and very well done,not to mention that its quite original,very well paced and has a lot of twist and turns,it always kept me on edge wanting more which let me to watch the next episode as soon as\
          \
        the other ended its also not predictable which is always a plus though there are some things you can see coming,but for the most part you will be suprised when unexpected events happen.so whats the downside in the story?well if your not paying attention and even if you are, you might get confused sometimes and if your like me youll hit rewind so you can follow whats going on properly.i guess i can mention the ending in the bad,but that wouldnt be fair since the ending to me was just the right ending so its more of a prefrence not a real flaw.next up is the caracters which is the other strong point od this anime. so whats good about them? they are all truely unique,they all have backstorys and you can see how they all connect in the story so well and how they all have motives that drive them to do what they do.some of them are you amazing and they just get to you because you dont expect them to do anything important.this is also true for the side caracters since they play some key rolesin the story.ok so whats bad about them? well though they all have storys and motives some are less than impresive motives and others just felt disposable,i know it sounds like a contradiction but what i mean is that all the caracters are portrait as important and some just end up standing out more than others this is particularly true with the side caracters that although they have a key role,after thats done they just get removed,another downside is a certain relationship between the main protagonist and one of the side caracters that falls in the terms yaoi but maybe thats just me. ok so on to the good of art. i wont say much since i dont pay to much attention to it but from what i saw it was done quite wellmand they also use some cg but thats just to highlight one of the caracters that sets the story in motion.if there was anything bad abot the art it might have been the cg but that really dosent bother me so i didnt really care. there are gore and bloody scences that sometimes looked a little dark along with some other scenes that looked dark but i think that those scenes needed that darkish look. now is the sound,whats good? well the opening and endings are very well done the music used for both is very good and it sets the mood for the anime perfectly and it gives you this tension every time you watch it.so whats bad about it well both the second opening and ending,though good they just arent as good as the first and feel more like an action filled opening or a deppresing sad ending. the soundtracks of the anime also dont really stand out very much but they do set the mood in some parts but only the first opening of the anime truely stands out.finally is this anime worth watching? yes. is it for evryone? no, its intended for mature hands down but its not like people care about that.so what type of anime is it and will you enjoy it? its a psychological/mystery with little bite sized chunks of action and even if you dont like these sort off anime i still think you should watch it and i almost guarantee youll enjoy it. but like i said this is meant for mature so all the whinny ecchi/moe lovers wearing naruto headbands and that are underage stay away from this anime its not for you.so long story short,watch this anime if you have the age youll like it\

    Pros\
+Solid art style \
+Interesting story \
+Female Lead (Gasai, Yuno) could be one of the most interesting charters i'v see \
+Good Pacing for the most part \
+Intro is awesome \
Cons\
-Ending was a little to convoluted\
-Male Lead was just beyond annoying\
-Pacing towards the end was poor\
My Opinion\
Alright let me preface this by saying i should have hated this show, i cant stand when the lead in a show is annoying and whinny, Amano, Yukiteru fits that description almost perfectly, but i do understand that the show couldn't have been what it was without this element. The saving grace was the counter weight to the Yuki and thats\
          \
        Gasai, Yuno, she is simply one of the most well developed characters iv seen in a show in a while. Her crazy personaity and action keep you thinking and make the show more unpredictable that most. \
The concept of the story was something interesting to me and the way they laid it out aloud from some really badass scenes between characters. The show kept me interested and for the most part thinking what will they do next? how will they figure this one out? and Yuno never let me down.\
Ahh the ending, don't worry i keep my reviews spoiler free but god this show could have used a better one. I feel like i would have rated this show a 9 if i didn't watch the last 6 episodes or so, the pacing was all wrong and the story was already convoluted enough without a whole load of to be honest unnecessary twists and turns.       \
I feel like i should have a special mention to opening to the show, as it is fantastic and i don't say that lightly, i normally avoid talking about it but i felt like it was a real work of art. It does everything its suppose to and gets me pumped for the show and also a little tease of whats to come    \
Should you watch this show? Yes the anime although has it flaws is still incredibly entertaining for the most part. I feel like you should most defiantly experience Mirai Nikki for what it is and also without a doubt see Gasai, Yuno in action \
Hope my review was helpful \

    Mirai Nikki, one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. \
A deathmatch between 12 people who can predict the future with their future diary. The catch? Your diary is your life. \
Every episode built suspense for the next episode, and once you finish the series, everything makes sense. \
The very beginning was dark but as you get towards the end of the anime, you realize the importance of that eerie scene. \
The character designs were awesome, the voices bringing out the characters. Yuuki is portrayed as quite feeble, and depends on Yuno to protect him all the time. Yuno's voice actress really brought her out.\
          \
        We can clearly tell of her fondness of Yuuki and how far she will go. \
I've watched this anime 3 times already and still enjoy it. Overall, I give it a 10/10.\

    Mirai Nikki is the type of show where it just seemed to get better the more it progressed. Each episode just seemed to build off each other and had a constant rate of intensity to it. Its dark humor, heart wrenching Action and killer Suspense made this one hell of an entertaining show!\
Story: \
The Story Of Mirai Nikki is your typical Survival Game/ Battle Royale/ Hunger Games show: A series of Contestants fight to the death in attempt to win something Grand or not get killed. In this case, it's the opportunity to be God of Space and Time. What makes this story stick out\
          \
        from the rest however is the depth the creators add to it. Usually in these survival game shows, you'll have some characters that are just expendable and there to be brutally murdered of some sort. Here it's different. Each Contestant is relevant and are given their time to shine, making it much more meaningful or impacting when you see a character that you now understand and relate with fight to the death. To say that this is just another Survival Game show is only half the truth, which leads me to another point on what Mirai Nikki does right: the Execution. Mirai Nikki could have easily been a, \"Fight an opponent, win, move on, rinse and repeat\" situation and while it does do that especially in the first half of the show, they really took advantage of the Romance element present between the two main characters. You see, there is an overarching mystery between the female lead, Yuno Gasai and the creators really used this situation to stray away from the usual fight to fight plot line and allowed the two main characters to get the development and dramatic reveals they needed in order to make the viewers constantly devoted to the two characters. By the end of the show I was in total shock at where each character ended up! This makes the series less a Mindless Horror flick and more of  an on your feet, Fist Clenching thrill ride that will keep you guessing all the way until the end. One thing I will say about Mirai Nikki that slightly hampers the show is that there are plot holes that deep observers of the show will notice since it does get a bit convoluted near the final episodes. However, the whole concept of time and alteration is always a hard subject to tackle without creating any plot holes or loops, but here they do a pretty good job.\
9/10\
Art:\
The Art of  Mirai Nikki is immaculate (If you're into gore, and over the top violence). I felt as if every scene fit the tone it was trying to present. It was Dark and Gritty at it's more serious moments and had its funny character animations and lighter art styles at its comedic times. Another great thing I liked about the art was that they held no bars back. It wasn't shy to show its gratuitous fan service or hold back on the violence and  for that I have to give it props. It gives the viewers what they came to see and to show no restriction just further shows how dedicated this anime really is.\
10/10\
Sound:\
Once again, the sound of Mirai Nikki summed up is: Fitting. The opening themes conveyed the fast pace that took place during it's ridiculous action scenes with it's symphonic rock and the ending themes really capture the desperation and struggle the characters face with it's slow rock. Aside from that, the background music is there really to help build tension or add to the overall atmosphere. I found myself hardly ever noticing the background themes though since I was too engrossed in the dialogue which is a bit of a shame.\
9/10\
Character:\
As I see it, the characters are really the main factor that makes or breaks many people and I can understand why. The Male Protagonist can be a bit of baby at first; breaking away from the Stoic hero cliche, and the Female lead is a total Psycho path Yandere who will literally make your jaw drop on several occasions. These two are not the most common people that many viewers are accustomed to seeing but really I wouldn't say that it's the characters themselves that can totally ruin or make you love the show, it's really your opinion. You see, I would say that when looking at the characters it's all relevant on why they act the way they are.  Each character has a reason for acting the way they are instead of simply acting a certain way  to advance the plot. Some characters may change at a twist that may actually purposefully cause distaste in the viewers and to be able to put that much detail and to be able to play with the watchers emotions is definitely a huge plus to the show.\
10/10\
Overall/Enjoyment:\
Mirai Nikki knows full and well what it is and excels at it. It doesn't try to appeal to everyone and instead goes beyond what it originally intends: A bloody good time. Everything feels important and relevant thanks to its attention to detail and is also wildly entertaining. It was the type of show where I can just sit back after a hard day and watch people fight to the death, get brutally back stabbed (Literally and metaphorically) and keep my eyes constantly glued to the screen. So with the future constantly changing, what are you waiting for?\

    This show has more plot holes than the amount of times Yuno says \"Yukki\".\
But does it make this show bad? It depends on how you feel. \
For me at least, a good show is defined not by its high technical merits, but by the amount it personally affects me. The point of reading/watching a story is to leave your surroundings, your environment, to discover other worlds.\
Character stories are intriguing and always tragic at some point. And although some may find the designs very unbalanced, with normal looking characters and One Piece looking characters together, their designs bring out their nature. (not going to spoil how,\
          \
        you figure it out yourself).\
 With its dissonant color palette and its developed character interaction/story, this show has twisted topics such as that of trust very well.\
Also, I have no idea how this show brought literally almost every single genre into it. (even yaoi)\

    I feel it's hard to properly review Mirai Nikki, because the series is so many things. Mirai Nikki is a psychological thriller, filled with gore, nudity, and some of the most twisted characters in all of anime.\
Story 10/10: I think the concept behind this show is one of the most genius out there, it can basically be summed up as a fantasy, mythological, hunger games. The series starts out following a young boy names Yukiteru Amano, or Yuki, who's only friend is his imaginary friend, Deus Ex Machina, the god of time and space. He soon finds out that Deus may not be as imaginary\
          \
        as he thinks when he gives him a diary that allows him to know what will happen in the future. It turns out Yukiteru is just one of twelve people who has been granted this power, and all of them have been selected by Deus to participate in a battle royale, where whoever is the one left standing by the end of a 90 day period, when the world will end, will become the new god of time and space.\
\
Art/animation 9/10: For the art I really loved the way the characters were drawn, and there's something about the animation that gives the setting a worldly feel.\
\
Sound 9/10: I loved the opening, it went perfect with the show and set the atmosphere perfectly. I also loved that creepy theme that always played for Yuno.\
\
characters 9/10: Mirai Nikki is mostly famous for one person. Yuno. However I do feel like she gets a little too much credit as the anime has other characters who I think are just as amazing. Like Uryuu Minene who seems to be everyone who watches the show's favorite character but is somehow over shadowed by Yuno. I can actually understand this as Yuno has been crowned queen of the yanderes(however in my opinion it's Shion Sonozaki). But enough of that. Mirai Nikki is also known for some of it's twisted characters who are just overly creepy and messed up. One thing I found interesting about how the characters were presented, was how as the story went on the main character became more twisted himself(and downright pathetic) and all the other characters were presented less as the villains.\
\
Enjoyment 8/10: Here is my biggest problem with the show, the series atmosphere felt really weak at some points, like i wanted to see more plot twists(however there are definitely some major ones), and it felt as if it was being told more as some normal fantasy instead of some trippy psychological thriller. But besides that I loves almost everything about it. Good character development, good art, interesting characters etc. \
I recommend this show to anyone who is looking for something memorable and that is a break through in the anime community.\

    It's certainly watchable and has very promising intro episodes, though at many points later I felt like dropping it. However, for at least half of cases where I did want to drop it, excellent plot twist or something would reveal how everything makes sense and cleverly comes together. In other 50% cases making sense would take a backseat to shounen-ish action or development. By that I mean non-realistic facepalm worthy stuff that always tries to get by on rule of cool, but only occasionally succeeds. \
Another tricky part is the middle section of Mirai Nikki which feels a bit stretched, where similar stuff seems to\
          \
        be going on and on without plot taking any turns. Luckily, in last third of the show, plot finally takes a turn for the better. It's all set up in a way that wondering how it'll end is what's keeping you watching, because the ending holds promise of being interesting. And if the ending was cheap, this show would plummet just like that. Fortunately that's not the case, and a large chunk of anime is dedicated to the ending arc. Other than all of it being a bit fantasy with added timeline changing, therefore stretching logic in places, the only actual complaint is that too often the story doesn't get explained very well, so you end up being confused a lot, only to later realize what's going on. \
Some episodes/arcs are great, while some are sucky to the point where removing them would hardly influence the story at all. I also feel that sometimes the convolution was used as a cop out, but I was confused enough that I couldn't tell anything for sure so it's hard to say now. Some of the time-manipulation is very clever, to the point where you need to pause and think to realize what just happened, while some of it is downright moronic, strange. \
Characterisation is surprisingly good. Characters really feel unique and real, at least the main cast. Yuno is such a great character that this is worth checking out for her alone. And she alone, is what got me through all the bad parts. Ending arc really has a redeeming quality, it far exceeded my expectations, and was very fun and memorable.\

    I haven't been watching anime for very long but I decided to watch this anime because I had heard that it was quite the trip. I heard correctly. Mirai Nikki was a wild roller coaster ride from the very first episode, which isn't always true for many animes that take a few episodes to become interesting. This was not the case with Mirai Nikki as I found myself immediately addicted to the show and also conflicted with how to feel about the two main characters along with the plot due to the events that occurred during the first couple of episodes. The whole idea behind\
          \
        Mirai Nikki, or \"The Future Diary\" is quite unique in my opinion and is something that caught my eye as I debated watching this anime. I won't dive in any deeper because you need to watch the anime to really figure out what it's about.\
I have seen people complain on other reviews that the plot developed slowly and predictably and that they quickly lost interest because of this fact. Personally, I agree that the plot lags a bit in the middle portions of the series but what kept me interested and intrigued throughout this entire show was the progression or the lack of progression of Yuno. The fact that her true intentions and dark past remain mostly a mystery until the very end is what kept me glued to my screen as I watched each episode and hoped that something would develop. It would be easy to say that this reasoning is why the show sucked, but for me, this dynamic was way more intriguing than the plot itself. During episodes I would find myself wondering, \"Will Yuno finally snap on Yuki and kill him?\" or \"Will Yuki finally start to love Yuno back?\" and \"What will Yuno do next?\", \"Why is Yuno doing this? What is her angle?\". You could say that Yuno is quite predictable, she will either go crazy or obsess over Yuki, but in reality she is actually quite unpredictable because you really have no idea why she does what she does or what she is truly aiming to accomplish. Each episode was a roller coaster of anxiety and more questions due to Yuno's dual personality and psychotic love for Yuki. With Yuno, you hope and hope that she might do this or do that, but most of the time she does something completely over the top, and honestly, you're never that upset about it! This sensation is what kept me coming back for more as I finished this anime in less than 3 days. Yuno's actions and motives are the driving force in this show and I do not mind one bit that I was hooked on Mirai Nikki because of that.\
I do not believe that this anime is meant to be taken all that seriously and that if you go into it with an open mind and low expectations, you will be pleasantly surprised and pretty much sick to your stomach due to the ups and downs experienced in this show. (in a good way)\
I admit that this anime is far from perfect due to a couple of glaring shortcomings. First of all, the main character is just soft and unbelievably boring. There is nothing about Yuki that catches my attention expect for the fact that he just adds to the already gigantic amount of anxiety and indecision that Yuno brings to the show. I found myself wanting Yuki to reciprocate the love that Yuno showed him instead of giving her the cold shoulder and running away in tears like he does most of the time. He was soft and scared even though he had the most bad ass murdering teenage girl in the palm of his hand and he never once showed Yuno any appreciation for her endless devotion to him and his safety,  (spoiler) which might have ultimately led to him becoming her prisoner. Secondly, many of the events in the anime seem very forced and random, but again I stress that this show does not really focus on details but instead on the big picture. Lastly, after all the love, betrayal and murder, the 26th episode leaves an unbelievably empty feeling in your heart and stomach. The last few episodes finally answer a lot of questions and adds an element of complexity to the show, but in the end every thing is just kind of meh (for lack of a better term). I was left with an unfinished feeling, as I thought the ending could have gone a million other ways that would have left viewers at least a little satisfied. I will say that I was a bit emotional at the end, but that was only because it was so tragic and frustrating after looking back at everything that Yuno and Yuki had been through leading up to the conclusion of Mirai Nikki (I'm a sucker for tragic love stories, they always cut me deep!) I won't go into detail but the ending is ultimately more or less a cop out and a weak attempt at preventing a happy ending at all costs while still providing something decent to look back on.\
As for other aspects of Mirai Nikki, there is not much to be said but they are worth mentioning. The animation is nothing special but it gets the job done. The sound is standard for the most part expect for the memorable first opening. There are a couple sad OST that really tugged at my emotions which and helped to make Mirai Nikki a bit more memorable, as I am a fan of well composed background music (especially the sad ones). There are a couple other relevant characters but I think I'll let you form your own opinions of them by watching the show.\
All in all, I believe this was an amazing anime with one of the greatest female characters ever and several beautiful moments that will stick in my mind forever. I firmly believe that Yuno is an anime character that we will only experience once every so often so her excellence as a murdering, cute, teenage stalker should not go unnoticed. Whether you like Mirai Nikki for the show itself or because Yuno just messes you up mentally and you surprisingly love her for it, this show will leave a lasting impact on you.  For people who just love creative animes with little complexity then this is the perfect anime for you. I will always love Mirai Nikki for the roller coaster of emotions that it is and it's ability to keep me wondering and yearning for certain outcomes during every single episode. The fact that this is not what you would call traditional is what makes it so beautiful and exciting. I urge you to watch Mirai Nikki before you develop any sort of bias from a silly review. Please, just do yourself a favor, open up your mind a little bit, expect the unexpected and watch Mirai Nikki! You won't regret it!\
Oh and by the way, this is my first review ever so I just hope it is at least a little bit helpful for some people and not a complete train wreck!",

The character development of Yuno drove the show to new heights.\
Well, as well as Yukiteru going a self-identity journey gives us something to relate to. \
The concept was well executed, well drawn, and well voice acted.\

    [No Spoilers]\
Mirai Nikki is an anime that is above average but inconsistent in many areas and ways. Some aspects of the anime are very well executed and work well, while other are mind-boggling, making me wonder why they decided to write this story the way they did, which is also it's biggest downfall, the story. But some of the action and characters make up for the this and end up making it a pretty good anime. If you truly look into the story, you will be confused, so it's best if you turn your brain off and take this anime at face value. I was\
          \
        generous and gave it an 8/10, mainly because I really like Yuno, but this is more of a 7.3- 7.7 anime.\
{Art} 6/10 - I'm starting with art because starting with story would be depressing lol. The art and animation in Mirai Nikki isn't amazing, but not terrible. It never really stands out at any point in the anime but it never takes away from it either. So it is fair or average.\
{Sound} 10/10 - honestly the first opening is one of the best in anime. Fast paced rock that goes perfectly for this anime and gets you pumped for the episode. The other soundtracks are good as well but OP 1 takes the cake for me. Yuno's voice actor is incredible, Yuki's is pretty good too.\
The rest are decent no voice actors take away from the experience.\
{Characters} 7/10 Yuno (9/10) - One of the most iconic characters in anime. She will do anything for her love Yuki. She is a psycho, she is crazy, and makes the story interesting. She doesn't really develop much because she is all on the table from the beginning, she loves Yuki and will do anything for him.\
                  Yuki (7.5/10) - A cliché character in the sense that he is a whiny protagonist that can't do anything, but he is diverse because of underlying personality. He likes Yuno, and slowly starts to love her, in which being around her has made him not as much of a puss. I like how he uses darts as weapons that is something new I have never seen before in an anime.\
                  Minnine (7/10 - I mean she is cool. She also progresses the plot multiple times in which I can't go into details because of spoilers but yea.\
 The rest are not that important or just minor supporting characters. The cop guy is pretty generic.\
{Enjoyment} (8/10) Like I said previously, if you look to deep into this anime, you will be disappointed, but enjoy the suspense and action and take it for face value and you will like it.\
{Story} (4/10) Oh boy. I'm going to try to keep this short. The basic ideas for this anime are not very original, but tweaked on in its own way with the future diaries, which make the action and the combat interesting. Some of the moments in this anime happen just to progress the plot, and some of the character decisions don't make much sense sometimes, and the influences to make these decisions are not fully explained, and some of the questions raised throughout the anime are never fully answered. **BUT** the action and suspense accompanied by great sound and moderately interesting characters keep it from being a BAD anime, but the story holds it back and keeps it from being a GREAT anime. I am going to be very generous and give it an 8/10 because.....I don't know. Maybe it's because this was the first anime I ever saw (besides the forbidden 4), and it holds a special place for me.\
Overall: Mirai Nikki is a decent anime. It holds a particular spot for me and that's why I gave it an 8/10 instead of something lower, which it probably deserves. But in conclusion, it is worth a watch but don't look too deep into the story. AND WATCH THE OVA IT SUMS UP THE STORY WAY MORE THAN THE ENDING IN THE LAST EPISODE. IT IS CRUTIAL. BECUASE THE REGULAR ENDING IS NOT GOOD. AT ALL. ALMOST MADE ME LOSE FAITH IN THE ENDING OF ANYTHING.\
Overall: 8/10 (GENEROUS)\

    Overview:\
This is one of my favorite anime to date. The story starts off with introducting the main character Yukiteru Amano. He's an unpopular kid at school that has no friends. He has an imaginary friend called Deus Ex Machina, but little does Yuki know he's not actually imaginary. Amano records everything in his diary on his phone that he says every day. One day he is talking to Deus and Deus creates a game of survival. Amano wakes up and thinks it is a dream but quickly realizes he isn't. HE  notices that there are already entries in his journal, and as he goes\
          \
        out through his day, every thing that is written in his diary comes to happen at the same time the diary says. These are known as the future diaries. There are 12 diary holders and only 1 can survive. Tune in to the anime to find out what happens! I promise you won't regret it \
Opinion:\
I think this anime is one of the better ones out there. As it is a sort of unique anime, in it being a survival type and actually being good. The way the story starts had me hooked instantly and even before watching it, it sounded like an awesome concept. I was suprised of how well the anime played out. The plot twists are pretty crazy and it leaves you guessing what is going to happen next after each episode. It really goes from 0-100 real quick. At points it goes from harmless romance to killing in an instant. Overall i think this is a great watch and reccomend it to anyone.\

    Imagine knowing your about to stare death in the face what do you do to Change that meeting with Death.\
Mirai Nikki or Future Diaries as it’s also known in my view is a masterpiece. The Artwork is fantastic and the story is Amazing.\
The Story is about a loner Called Yuki That is such well a loser he spends his time making a diary of his own life so it’s really only what he sees  and what may have happened during the day. Trust me the Anime is not as boring as I’m making it out right now. He and many others have been selected\
          \
        from the god of time and space to compete to succeed him as the new god. Now that’s pretty awesome. Only thing is it’s a battle Royale. Kill or be killed last survivor wins. Ok so it’s similar to the hunger games and if your a Fan of the hunger games you should love Mirai Nikki. Ok so no one gets to choose there weapon and run off they all have their own diary that tells the future in a special way which will tell them if the are about to die and how they will die. The players need to find a way to change the future by altering the next moves they make. Ok so how can the main Character Yuki possibly be a chance he has pychopathic Girl that is obsessed with him and will do anything really anything to save him. \
Ok so that’s the story without giving away spoilers. The only knocks I can give this Anime is a bit of a quick character personality change and  it can get confusing near the end. But if watched closely enough it shouldn’t be a problem.\
The best thing about the Story is It’s a amazing thriller that keeps you guessing and can’t stop watching there are many close calls with life and death and other situations has some similarities with the Saw Movies but not as gory. It has some romance involved and a bit of violence.\
All the Characters are amazing and make the Game such a edge of the seat Anime. Yuno Gasai is a real nut case but she is the reason why the Anime keeps you guessing and has you falling in love with a psychopathic character. All the other characters have some rivalries with each other such as a terrorist and a detective which makes for good viewing.\
I Loved Every episode and all the close calls wondering what the hell is going to happen next forcing myself to watch another episode at 3am.\

    Mirai Nikki O_O When I saw this anime, I though it looked cool, and it sounded simply amazing. I started watching, and the first episode to maybe about 4 was amazing, until the next made me want to throw up. I can usually take this kind of thing, horror and stuff, (I've seen Elfen Lied, stuff like that ) but this a new form of messed up. \
- STORY - 9 - I love this story of this anime. It sounds super cool, a guy who finds his phone can tell the future, and that he's just been set up to play in a battle\
          \
        to the death game. I just don't like what they did with the story... O_O\
- ART - 10 - The art for this anime is amazing, though, I don't really care that much about things like that, so I'm not one to ask. \
- SOUND - 9 - The openings and ending send chills down your spine- in a completely good way. They are amazingly creepy, again, in a good way. The background music and OSTs are simply amazing too. :)\
- CHARACTER - 7 - Now here's where I start to bag on this anime. The characters weren't all that bad- except Yuno O_O. Ok, so at first, I liked how Yuno was kind of a crazy stalker person. It was new, but they really started taking it too far. I also really don't think yuki was a great character either. He was kind of an emotional disaster half the time. \
- ENJOYMENT - 3 - Again, I loved up until, I think episode 4, then it made me vomit. It was too wrong, even for me, and I have a pretty tolerant mind to these kind of things. (blood, horror, violence) I also didn't like, at the end (the six) O_O. That was unnecessary to me. \
-OVERALL - 1- I really wish Yuno wasn't so twisted she killed practically anything, and I wish Yuki wasn't such an emotional pushover. I really wish that this anime stayed how it was the first 4 episodes. T^T\

    Mirai Nikki is a show I watched many years ago back when I was a yound teenager with barely any anime under my belt. At the time I found it confusing, gory, and utterly fantastic, and whilst I don't really ever talk to others about anime, would have cited it as one of the best at the time. Coming back to it 5 or so years on I can say that it's definitely not all that, but still holds up as an overall good piece of work by Sakae Esuno, and one I look forward to rewatching in another 5 years time. So join me\
          \
        now, as I try to mark as objectively as I can, and not look back at it with nostalgia tinted goggles, the show that is Mirai Nikki.\
Story: 8\
The story's premise is a relatively fresh and promising idea, that has a twist on the survival game genre of shows. Yukiteru, a lonely boy who writes in his diary is one day given the power to predict the future with his diary by the god of space and time Deus. However Deus is one forgetful and downright vindictive mofo at times and neglects to tell Yukiteru that he has been entered into a survival game with 11 other contestants, all who possess their own diaries which tell the future in different ways (These correspond to the diaries their owners kept. For example Yuno kept a diary all about Yukiteru and therefore her diary can predict his future). After he meets Gasai Yuno, a girl who reveals she has been in love with him and has been stalking him for a while, they manage to beat the man who is trying to kill Yuki and begin the survival games officially, with the prize being god of space and time. Unfortunately with any show that talks about predicting the future and changing it there end up being a lot of plot holes. A LOT of plot holes, whether they be just moronic things the characters do or actual incosistencies that don't make any sense. As I want to try and keep this review as spoiler free as possible I won't go into any specific incidents, but there are a lot. On top of this Esuno has written Yukiteru to have one of if not the best diary abilities, which, when mixed with a lack of clarification on how they work, leads to a large number of times when he has to nerf Yukiteru by making information just not be there, or make Yukiteru just not look at his diary when heading into certain situations, or other such stupid ideas. The largest plot twist in the series also raises a very large number of plot holes, as one of the characters actions no longer make any sense at all. As I had seen this before and was rewatching I knew most of the major points of the show, and I found it very easy to follow along and pick these holes, however, they may or may not be as apparent to people watching for the first time. I feel like certain sections of the show have been heavily rushed, which seems consistent with Esuno's works in general, however overall I feel that the story has been well fleshed out and is enjoyable. With several of the 'arcs' being very enjoyable. The story also sticks to the darker gorier side, with light hearted episodes being few and far between (that's not to say there aren't many light hearted/funny moments, there just aren't many full light hearted episodes), it's quite nice to see an anime that hasn't fallen to the fanservice demon (although there are a few moments, it isn't offensively bad), and actually manages to follow the manga and come to a satisfying end.\
Art: 7\
The art style is nice and clean, although personally I think it can look a little off sometimes. This is sometimes actually a benefit, as it can create an unsettling atmosphere, however it sometimes just looks plain wrong. One thing Sakae Esuno really seems to like doing is making characters who have something planned really contract their pupil and make their eyes go wider, as well as sometimes giving an evil grin. This seems to have happend to 90% of the characters at some point, but Yuno seems to do the eye thing at least once every other episode. Sometimes it really puts the fear of god into you, whilst other times she just looks like she is having a siezure.\
Sound: 7\
The music is good, both of the openings are good and I'm a fan of the first ending too (the second is alright, just not catchy enough for me to really listen to.). They're all quite pumped up and make you feel ready for action too. Some of the soundtracks, particularly \"Together with you\", is beautiful, and can invoke strong emotions in people who haven't even watched the show. The voice acting in general is nice too, although Yuno's constant \"Yuki\" can get on your nerves from time to time. Some people absolutely hate that, it doesn't bother me too much, but be warned it will be there all the time.\
Character: 8\
I was tempted to rank the character a lot lower, as there are some glaringly large problems with Mirai Nikki's characters, however I've ranked it this high as I feel that for all it does wrong, there is also a lot the show does right. Firstly, it has the iconic Gasai Yuno, who is what people think of whenever some distant weeb mutters the word Yandere in a darkened room. The main character Yukiteru is also someone I think is written quite well, as there is genuine character development from him, starting off as a shy and downright pathetic character, who grows into something stronger and more likeable. However, he does have frequen changes of personality depeninding on how Esuno feels, sometimes wanting to abandon people for no reason and other times insisting on saving everyone even when they have tried to kill him not long before. Another notable character is 4th, who actually has some decent character development, as well as Akise. However the other characters can vary from ok to a big let down. Most of the 'villains' only last for one or two episodes, and almost every one of them follows the structure of; 1st episode- Do reprehensible and immoral things and just seem like a dick in general, try to kill Yukiteru and by extension, Yuno. 2nd episode- Yuki has the upper hand now, time to splice in between 2 and 5 minutes of backstory where the character has undergone something tragic (namely loss of parents or being raped), which has warped them into what they are. DO YOU FEEL SORRY FOR THIS MURDERER YET?\
While I feel this works occaisonally, or if enough time is given to the backstory and character, most of them feel very rushed, and doesn't really make you feel sorry for the character when you remember what they've done. For example Uryuu Minene, one of the most fleshed out B characters lost her parents at a young age and turned to stealing stuff for a living, before becoming a terrorist. Great, still doesn't change the fact in episode 2 (minor spoilers), she blew up about 80 children in a school. This is a literal child murderer who the show tries to make you feel sorry for because she had no parents. Or how about the girl who owns an evil sect and tries to kill the two protagonists, followed by trying to lure Yuki out by getting about 50 of her followers to pin Yuno down and telling them all to rape her. Yeah you heard me right. To rape her. But it's fine guys. We should feel sorry for her because she lost her parents at a young age AND was raped. Hoo, what a shocker.\
Speaking of Uryuu, she is the most dissapointing character in my mind. A lot of people love her because she is strong and badass and to a certain extent thats true. But they completely change her character from an absolute psychopath who like I said, literally murdered about 80 kids, to someone who then goes on to be a vital ally and become some sort of Shoujo female love interest character for no reason whatsoever. It feels unwarranted and intrusive, and there's one section that anyone who has seen it will no what Im talking about with her in, that makes no sense and ruins her a hell of a lot. Some of the other characters, funnily enough the ones they don't flesh out as much, have some real charm to them, and may make you hate them, or laugh, or feel something at least. Again. The score on this one is so high, as I feel whilst there is a lot to hate about the characters, there is also a lot to love about them, and at the end of the day watching it I feel like they are somewhat well designed (even if the vast majority of them make constant completely irrational desicions)\
Enjoyment: 9\
This is an enjoyable piece. Maybe it's because it's one of the first anime I ever watched, and seeing it again I couldn't help but keep it up on its pedestal, but Mirai Nikki is a fast paced suspenseful show. It combines gory bloody combat with heartthrobbing romance scenes. It has stuff that'll make you laugh, make you gasp, and makes a lot of people cry too. \
Overall: 8\
The show has a lot of kinks, there's no doubt about it, but Mirai Nikki is a show that has good art and music, and that manages to successfully combine Yandere romance with gory action to create something unique and interesting. The plot twists themselves can be somewhat surprsing and interesting, and I found myself genuinely invested in what was happening in the world, even through a second sitting.\
Is it the best anime ever as my 13 year old self once thought? Definitely not.\
Should you watch it? Definitely.\

    I seriously do not know why people hype up this anime and why its so popular; at best its average and certainly not amazing. What bugged me the most was how annoyed I with the characters and their development as the anime came to a close. The story line had a lot of potential but there were just too many holes in the plot that prevented me from enjoying it. \

A few things that annoyed me the most:\
Main male character is a whinny SOB through the whole anime. Yukki's  weakness & indecisiveness at times was so irritating that I almost didn't even complete\
          \
        the series. The toddler, Reisuke, was more cunning then him wtf seriously!!!\
Early on in the game, how did Ex Machina in the third or second world not know that the winner of the first world (Yuno) was messing with his alternate world? If the Ex Machina's of the second and third world can control space and time, shouldn't they be able determine that some entity is alerting timelines in profound ways. This question intensely bugs me because it down plays the role of God, which is the ultimate goal of winning the game.\

    Ah...a legendary anime about one of if not the most famous psycho girl ever, Mirai Nikki (Future Diary). If you have ever had a crazy ex in your life or have a stalker who has a crush on you, then this show might hit home a bit except there is a lot of killing in this show. \
Story: The general jest of the show is being able to win a Grand Battle Royal and become the next god. The contestants are given a special tool that helps them survive and to outwit their enemies.This show gave wired feels the whole time. It was not the\
          \
        best idea of a story but still kept me going for it felt the story did not really revolve around the battle but around Yuki’s “love” issue.\
Characters: \
Yuki: He is a major loser through the whole thing. He ticked me off on how he was such a wuss. He was a pointless in almost anything that happened.\
Yuno Gasai: She is the definition of psycho gf and she is what is known as a Yandere, term meaning crazy violent “lover”. Yuno is the one who kept the show going for me. He reason for being so messed up was not all that great but was still interesting enough.\

Story: I really enjoyed the idea of making survival games of 12 people and using phones as some sort of future seeing powers. I got hooked up right from the first episode and i stayed like that until ep 23 or somewhere around\
          \
        that. Then stuff got pretty weird by that i mean ending of the world and yuki becoming a killing machine.\
The story managed to keep me entertained even while there was no action happening.\
Of course the story wasn't perfect it had its flaws but i think it was pretty entertaining.\
Art: well i think art was pretty good im really not sure what to say about art so ill leave it here.\
Sound: I watched dubbed and subbed and i think i prefer dubbed and thats why:\
Subbed was good but yuno has really annoying high pitch voice well the guy had pretty annoying voice too but it wasn't that bad.\
Dubbed was really great tho not high pitched and it was possible to see emotions in their voices.\
Character: Characters were good except yuki i guess... he was to much of a cry-baby he was scared basically of everything and everyone so he was pretty useless. One more thing that i didn't like about him was that he turned into some sort of killing machine at the end like he went from \"Please dont look at me\" to \"i eat your guts for dinner\". They should give him just a bit of courage and not totally making killing machine.\
Yuno was good character also she was cute sometimes scary but great character in general.\
I wont talk about supporting characters cuz they aren't that important.\
Enjoyment: I enjoyed it almost to the end the only thing that i hated was from ep 23(or somewhere there) to the ending. The ending was pretty horrible even the \"good ending\". Normal ending was pretty confusing and failed at being sad at least for me. The \"good ending\" only showed yuki's reaction at the last 30 sec which killed 50% of the happiness... it should of showed them for at least 5 min so we can see better their reactions and what they will do for the future by that i mean if they will stay together, will they still continue on being gods, will they travel back to earth and all that. \
Overall: I enjoyed it even tho it had lots and lots of small mistakes by that i mean the characters took some really stupid decisions or failed at their job like yuki being cry baby or yuno being a killer machine. The mistakes they made weren't that big and wont kill the enjoyment unless you think to much about things they did and what they could of done but i believe if there were more mistakes it would totally kill the enjoyment.\
Also there were some parts that would be better if they were changed a bit not because of errors but of enjoyment.\
For some reason it reminded me of Re:zero im just not sure how to explain.",

    I was recommended watching this series for about a few months ago but looked away because I normally doesn't like psychological and thriller genre. And the artwork wasn't \"Perfect\".\
But then I thought \"This Anime is really popular, and rated really high, why not just watch it.\"\
First two episodes was like a black hole. Once seen, you can't go away. I literally watched the whole Anime on two days... 2 days!!\
This is not my favorite Anime (Prefer Drama/Romance) but it was enjoying as hell. I don't even like action that much, but this was amazing and made the characters nearly always fight in a creative way.\
Ending\

    Back when I first heard of Mirai nikki, I thought of it as a Death Note rip-off, but good news, I was wrong. But this was also bad, because a rip-off of a masterpiece could, in my opinion, only be good. But I was wrong. \
Let's get on this review of the masterpiece that could have been, Mirai Nikki, loved by most, hated by the others.\
Story 5/10 \
When I began watching this show, I could only marvel at the story: it was so good, a little rushed at times, but it was so good ! Soon, I saw that I my mistake. Starting from around\
          \
        the 8th episode, the plotholes began to appear, and the villain-of-the-week schema had begun. And so, the psychological thriller that I loved so much at first turned into a mainstream shounen battle anime by the last episodes. It looks like the guys who made this anime had a very talented staff for the beginning of the show, and suddenly fired them to replace them with a bunch of amateurs. \
Art 8/10\
Art-wise, there's nothing, or almost, to say. The animation is decent, and beautiful during some of the battle-scenes. It's not a masterpiece, but beautiful nevertheless.\
Sound 9/10\
I loved Mirai Nikki's soundtrack before I even started watching it. Why ? Because of the masterpiece that is its first opening. But, as all openings go, it was replaced with something that I hate in animes : a song sung in English by a Japanese singer. The Japanese accent destroys all that could have made the song great, in my opinion. On the other hand, both the endings are great. The OST is not bad either.\
Character 5/10\
Here's the tricky part. If there's one thing that Mirai Nikki is loved for, it's the characters, especially Gasai Yuno, the queen of all yanderes. But that's what I hate about her. You can resume all of her thinking in one sentence : she loves the main character, Yukiteru, and will do everything for him. Of course, there's the final plotwist,  which could have made the character incredibly better. But it didn't. \
Now, let's move to the main, Amano Yukiteru. During all the show, I waited for him to finally do something, stop hiding behind Yuno, becoming badass, I don't know.  The only character who's written more badly than this guy is Yuno. He's annoying most of the time, and, like the rest of the cast (except Yuno, the only intelligent character), he's TOTALLY STUPID.\
The other diary owners are even worse. Their development barely grazed the surface, they were stupid as hell, and sometimes defied logic, only contributing to make more plotholes. \
Let me explain. Some of them appear to know Deus. How did they meet him ? We don't know. How did a 5-year-old girl got her hands on highly dangerous gas ? We don't know. I could go on for a long time like this, but I don't want to totally spoil the story.\
Enjoyment 6/10\
I mildly enjoyed this anime. Some moments felt boring, while others were absolutely great. The suspense was often killed by comic relief moments in the middle of a fight, and the writing kept getting worse as time went by. \
Overall 6/10\
If I had to put it shortly, I'd say Mirai Nikki was a huge disappointment. It had huge potential, but didn't manage to exploit it. \
Trust me I'd like to recommend it to you, but I can't. Don't watch this anime. It'll only be a boring and disappointing experience.\

    Art and sound\
This show is very nice on the eyes and ears. The art and animation are solid with a good use of lightning, though it does have some jarring 3D. The soundtrack is really cool and fitting and the first half has an opening and ending that I think are among some of the best ever. The acting is also good, most actors have to switch from harmless to batshit crazy and it's always believable.\
\
Story and characters\
The story and characters are rather ridiculous, though, if you apply your sense of realism to it for one second the whole thing will collapse in on itself.\
          \
        The way to watch Mirai Nikki is to just go with the flow, the plot is fast and full of surprises and it will keep you on the edge of your seat. \
The characters are colourful and there's some nice ideas in there, but the show falls into the trap of going \"see, this bad thing happened so of course they're psychopaths now!\", which was really simple and nonsensical a lot of the time, like there's a primary school kid that's capable of elaborate maniacal murder. The lead is another one of those whiny anime protagonists, whose big tragedy is that his parents are divorced and now he doesn't have a perfect family, but really who cares this is the anime that has Yuno in it. For those who aren't in on it, Yuno is the most yanderest yandere that has ever picked up a cleaver for the dude she loves and she is terrible and impossible to hate. A lot of the time she's basically the perfect girlfriend and completely devoted to Yuki, except she's also murderous and obsessive and all round crazy as hell. Yuki uses her devotion but gets so wrapped up in his act and Yuno's possessive declarations of love that he starts to fall for her and that is some psychological horror right there except I think we're supposed to think it's positive by the end. Eh.\
There are a lot more characters but I can't go into the entire cast, I will just briefly highlight that there's a Kaworu ripoff for the slash shippers and that I think the most likeable character is the terrorist that blew up half of Yuki's school while there were people in it. It's that kind of show.\
\
Final thoughts\
I watched this show when I was sick and just wanted to see things get killed, it is absolutely great for that. I could write for ages about why this show is disturbing, nonsensical and wrong, but if you just take it for what it is and enjoy the plot it's very entertaining.\

    This show is dark and may very well disturb you. Mirai Nikki isn't afraid to show taboo scenes and extreme violence. Now with that being said if you want a dark psychological thrill ride then this is the show for you.\
The basic story is we follow Yukiteru \"Yuki\" Amano a young man who prefers to observe and write in the diary in phone. One day his \"Imaginary Friend\" Deus Ex Machina says he has upgraded Yuki's phone. Yuki then sees his phone has posts that come from the future he uses this until his phone changes and states DEAD END. He soon notices that his\
          \
        classmate Yuno Gasai is following him and she informs him someone is trying to kill him. She knows this because they are in a survival game with 10 others to decide who will become god. Yuno's diary luckily tells them what happens to Yuki. Despite all his fear Yuki decides to trust Yuno and deal with the survival game.\
In my opinion the strongest element is the female lead Yuno Gasai. Despite being obsessed with Yuki she still stand out as a strong female lead. Many time in the story she tell Yuki not to fight just because she knows she can handle it. Also the performance by Brina Palencia in the dub was one of my favorite dub performances ever.\
Overall i know many people will despise this show. Saying that its trashy mean spirited and is trying to hard to be a Mind-Fuck. These reasons maybe why i enjoyed the show so much but i do have to say this is my favorite anime ever not the best by a long shot but i enjoyed this show more and any other. So if the violence and the disturbing imagery doesn't turn you off enjoy Mirai Nikki A.K.A. The Future Diary because i sure did\

    Ok... This anime Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) is a kind of anime wherein you will encounter Yandere.. or beautiful but violent girlfriends.\
Before that, this series has an action, drama and love story elements in it. Let's start first with a brief introduction. The story starts with a boy named Yuuki. He thinks himself as an outsider/observer to the real events happening around him. He doesn't give a damn about the real world as he was busy with the contents of his cellphone. One day, he became involved in a battle royale wherein each characters has phone dictating their future in different kinds of style. Then,\
          \
        he meets Yuuno, a yandere who is very very obsessed with him. Together with Yuuno, Yukki finds a way in order to survive the insane Battle Royale..\
Ok.. I'm going to describe my thoughts using the elements of rating the anime.. Here are my opinions\
story (8)\
Dude men! This is one hell of a new concept. Where in the world do you think you'll going to find an action anime wherein cellphone diaries are the main components? I think this is the first one.. In my opinion, it is a fresh concept. Not only that, each cellphones has its own brand or way predicting the future. That means, the writer puts a huge effort in order to create a good story wherein mind games are included.. It's a good point. Overall, I find the concept of Future Diaries awesome in my own way..\
Another point is the struggles of the protagonist Yuuki.. You can say that you can't blame him if he acts pathetically. You can sense that. You can feel the hesitation, the uneasiness.. You can feel that he is scared. Why? Because anytime soon, there is someone who is gonna knock on your door and going to kill you.. That's messed up right? In reality sense. that's freaking disturbing.. \
Yuuno's yandere mode is also quite fun but at the same time very disturbing. Just watch in order to feel it.. You're gonna say to yourslef \"DAMN! I don't want this kind of girlfriend even though she is hot and beautiful!\"\
Lastly, why did I say 8? I feel like it.. JOKE! My reason is this, I hate Time Travelling kind of stuff or stuff like concerning parallel worlds.. Maybe it clouded my judgement but I don't know...\
Art (9)\
No doubt about it.. It has good animation but not that Epic compared to series such as Guilty Crown..\
Sound (6)\
Hmm... It is because the OST and the ending songs are not too much appealing to me.. \
Character (10)\
This.. I gave it a 10 because there are many characters with different personalities. Example, Yuuki and Yuuno.. Different personalities gave a spice in the story. I think that each character are well conceptualized..\
Enjoyment (9)\
I enjoyed the concept of the Battle Royale.. But the one thing that enjoys me the most is the transformation of Yuuki from good guy to a bad guy (OOPS! Is this a spoiler? Sorry). That is a shocking twist.. I like plot twist especially the \"very shocking\" ones..\
Overall (8)\
Well, there's one thing that I want to say before I end this entry.. I don't want to be pitted in that kind of scenario.. It's scary..\
Thank you for reading.. And sorry for the description on the story part..\

    After just completing this series, I definitely found myself astonished at the events that occurred  throughout the entire series. \
It starts off with the Main Character Yukiteru Amano and his lovely psychotic, weird.... stalker... girlfriend-ish person... Yuno Gasai.\
Its a game about survival, to kill other players. The twist to the plot, is that each member has a form of telling the future.  Which portrays the question of, how is one able to kill someone if they can see it coming? \
This creates a long journey of survival between Yukiteru Amano player #1, and his homicidal, psychopathic, stalker.  Yuno Gasai player #2. \
          \
        A story of love, trust and betrayal and of course, death.\
This is the journey that I gave an 8/10, about how 2 players striving to survive, while knowing that in the end, there can only be 1 winner.\

    My review is going to be blunt, my opinion is obsolete and will never change.\
I see this as one of the best romance anime, the main aspect i chose to focus on was love.\
This anime allows people to have the understanding of what true love can look like and how it may end up , for better and for worse. \
Love can be worth fighting for, but don't think fighting for it will result in the outcome you want it to be. In saying that , it doesn't me that you shouldn't try to.\

    \"I have to tell them that last night was a shameful train wreck filled with blind cuddly puppies\" - Charlie Sheen\
My overall rating (7) is considered \"good\" so it's not a bad score \
Ok that may seem like a weird a weird quote for this anime, but let me explain. I really really liked some parts of Mirai Nikki like the art, the sound, and there were some great characters with rich backgrounds ready to be explored! They have all these great ingredients, but end up either not using those ingredients or not using them to the fullest.\
Story 5 - The set up was of\
          \
        a battle royal to see who would become god nothing really special in my books, so I was expecting to give the story an 7 or around that. The last 3-4 episodes changed my mind completely when it stopped being a psychological thriller with action of course and just turned into a huge slug fest of who has the most godly powers and can create black balls of \"energy\" and shoot them at each other. The god is called Deus ex machina which made me laugh because Deus ex machina is Latin for God of the machine. You may think why would you laugh at that? The reason is that Deus ex machina is also a term for where seemingly impossible situations are solved  immediately with little explanation. It is usually seen as poor writing to use Deus ex machina in your plot. I couldn't tell if the name of the god was some kind of joke, but it did make me laugh. There was a lot of jumping in the anime near the later episodes which can confuse people and probably had  events from the manga that weren't added to the Anime. Also one thing that bugged me was that basically not one of the 12 future diary holders were killed by anyone other than Yuno! It was almost like all of diary holders were just trying to kill yuki and yuno!  \
Art 9 - Some amazing art this would be one of the great ingredients that Mirai Nikki had, but was ultimately let down by the plot and other things. Nuff said\
Sound 9 - The sound in Mirai Nikki fit the situations they were in perfectly and was another great ingredient in the show, but the reason I didn't give sound a 10 which I was on the edge of doing was that it wasn't used to it's full potential. The music was blunt in its nature. What I mean by this is that the music signald to you what is going to come next and never mislead you or created false suspense like a good Thriller/ Physiological / Mystery should. It may seem like I'm knit picking things and that's kinda true because when it comes between the difference between a 10 (Master piece) and 9 (Great) I try and see if it is truly worthy of a 10. \
Characters 7 - I loved the Characters! ... just not the main male character. Most Main characters (not all) fall into 3 categories Strong and dumb, Smart and Confident, and Weak and naive. Unfortunately \"Yuki\" falls into the third category and single-handedly lowered the score from characters from a 9 to a 7. All the other characters had a rich back story full of pain anguish and a reason to be in this game while \"yuki\" has divorced parents and is a little depressed because he feels lonely. There are some characters who didn't get any exploration even if they looked like they had a interesting story.Even though \"yuki\" was only one character he was the MAIN character and he only made you want to strangle him sometimes. Yuno was a crazy ass bitch who was insanely crazy! She added most of tension in the series and creeped me the fuck out and was one of the best fleshed out characters I've seen in a while, but in the final episodes her craziness seemed to get less and less intense without much reason behind. Yes, she was conflicted about killing yuki because she loves him, but she literately tried to kill him half a dozen times before that. Overall though she was a good a good character who progressed the plot forward more than anyone else.   \
Enjoyment 7 - The plot may have holes and the main character might be a let down, but overall I enjoyed it. \
Overall 7 - I think that story, characters, and enjoyment are the most important factors (about 90%) while art and sound should be an after thought. Art and sound should only be able to bring the score up one or down one it shouldn't be able to dictate the whole score so that's why if this was a book (no pictures or sounds) I would have given it a 6, but the sound and art were both amazing so I can only say that this anime deserves a 7 (good)\
Also the quote at the beginning. \
Puppies = art, sound, Most characters except Yuki.   \
Train wreck = Story, Yuki.\

    Mirai Nikki, aka Future Diary, was a show that I am still kind of unsure about. This show is the embodiment of what being psychotic seems to be. \
Honestly, my favorite part of this entire anime was the intro and its music. I LOVED it. The intro from episodes 1 - 12 (or 13) was great. I suppose the music fits whatever kind of genre I listen to. From then on, it was good, but nothing like the opening one. The sound throughout the show was great as well. I enjoyed it.\
The characters were pretty well thought out. I tried to figure out Yuno's secret\
          \
        as best I could before they revealed it, and I was completely stumped. Didn't see that coming. I liked how the people progressed, especially Kousaka, he was probably my favorite character based on his development. On that note, the overall development of characters (besides Yukiteru, which I'll get to next) was great.\
As I mentioned, I didn't like Yukiteru's development.There's no way a sane human being would fall in love the way he does. No way, unless said person was a complete psycho, which seems to be a common element in this series. I can't describe much without spoilers, so I will digress.\
Okay, so I kind of have this thought which kind of contradicts the main \"events\" from the show. The future diaries showed the future, yes, but wouldn't them showing the future alone cause the future to change? Therefore, every time they looked at their phones, there should have been static. Knowledge is power, and that alone should change the future. And if they actually were future diaries, then that is exactly what should have happened anyways. It's just something that came into my head, but something like that would not only destroy the plot, but it would also make everything boring, so they couldn't do that. \
All in all, I didn't mind watching it. Could I have skipped it and watched another one (or two) different animes? Sure. This was something outside of what I normally watch. I guess I would compare it with Elfen Lied. Anyways, if you decide to watch it, I hope you enjoy. Thanks for reading.\

    Since Mirai Nikki is the first anime I've watched from the thriller genre, I honestly didn't know what to expect. After watching the first episode, I was really creeped out, but each episode made me want to watch the next. Even if you don't normally go for dark-themed anime (like me), I would definitely suggest that you give this one a shot.\
[Story: 9]\
The story was good and the pacing was just right. There were some things that could've been explained better, but if you're not as observant as others, you'd hardly notice them. There was a lot of romance and definitely a good amount of\
          \
        action. The first episode was really intense, but the badass ending really topped it.\
[Art: 9]\
I really liked the art and how all the characters looked (well, maybe Yuki's character is an exception--not really a fan of his character's physical appearance).\
[Sound: 10]\
You know how in horror films, the sound effects are sometimes scarier than the other scenes, or when they boost the scare-factor of the overall film? I think that's how it was with Mirai Nikki, for me.\
[Characters: 7]\
I would love to get into each character and what I love about them, but that might take some time. Generally, I loved all the characters (especially Yuno!) except for Yuki, our male lead. I guess you could say he's practically a male version of Bella Swan. (I'm not bashing Twilight--I actually like it--but we all know that Bella doesn't do anything to help.) Yuno, the female lead, is a character you could either love or hate. I definitely loved her. I thought her character was the best developed out of them all.\
[Enjoyment: 10]\
Like I said, each episode made me want to watch the next! Most of the time, when I watch anime, I end up getting bored as the series goes on... Mirai Nikki doesn't drag the plot around, every episode has a purpose, and every episode is thrilling.\

    Mirai nikki also known in english as future diary is a 26 episode long series that is about a select few number of people battling each other in a battle royal deathmatch orchestrated by the god of the world deus ex machina. This show is really nothing special despite it having a glimmer of hope in the first few episodes with adding a very original concept of having a specific diary that can tell the future in various ways but all balanced which personally i believed based on setting alone was an anime brilliant enough to rival things such as Fate/zero. \
However, sadly this show\
          \
        had an ultimate downfall of making this show a more character driven story which failed as all the characters except gasai Yuno was completely one dimensional an example would be Yuki who is a Shinji hikari type character who is really annoying but unlike Shinji never developes. The show would mainly revolve between the romance of Yuno and Yuki making the show 90% of the time a nightmare to watch due to the actions made by yuki. So why would my enjoyment of this show be an 8/10? because that final 10% is close to being extremely satisfying not only knowing that this discusting monstrosity of a psychological thriller anime was nearly over and the last minute of the anime before the ending credits was brilliant and emotionally compelling. This is a perfect example of why i believe a show can be good if it just has a great ending. However all i can give this show is a 6/10 because instead of being a spectacle in its own right it uses very stereo typical plot devices etc. that are nothing even remotely unique. It was executed soo poorly that it was depressing to watch it could have been an epic that focussed around the battle royal and character motivations of all rounded development but instead introduced side characters that i didn't even in the slightest care about. Also the show revolved an anxious romance between 14 year olds which felt very awkward especially where i was supposed to use my brain to watch because the last time i recall it psychological thrillers require use of a brain. So besides one interesting character, a brilliant ending and an original concept mirai nikki is nothing special instead of watching this i would recommend something in my opinion is way better of the same genres just instead of romance there is mystery and instead of that multi world BS which i saw as nothing more than a plot device there are actual explanations to what happens only if the two seasons are completed. The show is higurashi no naku koro ni  this is my first ever review and i hopped you found it useful in your ultimate decision to the show\

    SPOILER ALERT\
I both loved this anime and truly wish I didn't watch it.  \
This is one of the few animes that I watched in one sitting (yes, all 26 episodes).  It was just so interesting and thrilling that I had to keep watching.  I became really invested in the characters and the story, so I had to know what happened. \
There was a ton that I really love about Mirai Nikki.  I think Yuno is very cute and, when she is not a complete psycho, is a very endearing character.  She is portrayed in a way that makes viewers kind\
          \
        of like her despite how crazy she is.  I think that can be a difficult thing to do.  Though you like her in some ways, you can also never ignore her faults (like oh, you know, her murderous tendancies...).\
I also thought the psychological and physical battles between Yukki and Yuno and the other contestants were well done.  Though disturbing, the strategy and complecity of some of the fights were really intriguing.  The battle with the little kid is simutaneously my favorite and least favorite battle because of how scary and complex it was.\
I also liked how the backstories of every contestant was unique and important to the story.  You learned why each one fought, why each was desperate or crazy.  It really gave depth to the characters and made you consider whether or not Yukki and Yuno were really the good guy, or if anyone was in the right at all.\
However, there were a few thing about the series that bugged me.\
Though many like Yukki because he has (sort of) realistic reactions to everything going on, I really dislike him. He is so annoying and never even tries to defend himself well.  He's constantly flip-flopping and is never loyal to anyone. He doesn't grow much as a character. He learns new things, but doesn't really change himself.  He's not th worst character in the world, but certainly not my favorite.\
Also, this anime is not for the faint of heart.  There are tons of disturbing sequences (violence, rape, etc.) and those who could be triggered by anything like that should not watch it.  I found some of it too disturbing, but I understood the function of that level of twistedness in the context of the show.\
Anywho, I think if you like psychological thriller animes (or I guess if you just like extreme Yanderes) this is a good one to watch.\

    Strong start, great plot. As with most time related animes the story is well written and pretty enjoyable. It also posses the element of competition, that boosts your curiosity to the limit and makes you want to see the whole series in a day. The art isn't really outstanding but still admirable. In terms of character development, the characters are well designed but sometimes lack depth. However,Yuno's complicated character totally makes up for it.

Ok so basically:\
-The thriller aspect, plot twists and the character development I feel is very similar to Psycho-Pass\
-The \"Game\" feels very Fate/-ish\
-The Akise Aru parts remind me a lot of Death Note\

    You probably have heard about this series because of Yuno, the clingy psychotic pseudo-stalker who much of the story revolves around. So most people start watching this anime because they are suggested it as an \"anime with a crazy girl in it.\" I really enjoyed the series, but it's not for everyone. Essentially its a unconventional romance story in a suspenseful setting wrapped in a survival game. If that doesn't make sense imagine Death Note where light yagami sucks at everything and has his girlfriend do everything instead ,and then near the end people get magic powers and start throwing Kamehamehas at each other. The\
          \
        plot revolves around twelve people who are given the ability to see the future by a dying god who will give his godly powers to the last one alive. All of the characters are well thought out ,and the biggest strength of the show is way they develop due to the frequent horrible events they are forced into. If want to see an intertaining story, with great character progression, but need some violence for it to keep your attention you will enjoy this series. \

    If it annoys you to see people utterly dependent on their mobiles, stay well away from Mirai Nikki!\
Nothing brings down an anime like an unlikable main character, and no main character has ever annoyed me more than Yukiteru. From his cringeworthy relationship with Yuno to the way he manipulated her yandere feelings for him, the lack of any redeeming characteristics for Yukiteru made him completely unrelatable. I understand that this anime was supposed to be twisted, but a good psychological show will bring out twisted sympathy in the viewer, and watching this, I felt alienated. In fact, Mirai Nikki does such a perfect job of\
          \
        making Yukiteru despicable that I have wondered if it was precisely what the creators were aiming for. Was the anime meant to bring out a strong sense of justice by having such a backward, selfish, unrelatable main character? I don't know, but it certainly wasn't fun for me to watch.\
The story was pretty smart, and definitely worth checking out if you're a hardcore fan of time travel. Beyond that, I think its a very good anime to watch with friends (NOT TOGETHER), as even I have to admit, it's a fun topic to discuss!\

    Gasai Yuno - greatest yandere ever, or merely the best yandere ever?\
Alas, Yuno cannot rescue MN from itself. Yuno has a great backstory, but the problem is, MN has set up a scenario which ought to be essentially _Death Note_ where everyone has a different kind of Death Note, and this comes with expectations of brainy strategizing and thinking - and MN generally fails on this note gets sloppy; by episode 10, I kept thinking: 'has everyone but me forgotten about Dead Ends?'

An arrant example of arbitrarily breaking a constructed universe to *force* a totally happy ending. 'Happy End'? More like' Stupid End'. Yukiteru being emo was fine; even _Madoka_ didn't feel the need to bring Madoka back after her sacrifice. Disgusted.\

    STORY - 9\
Let me start right off the bat with the biggest flaw in this anime: it takes itself a little too seriously. Mirai Nikki is not a story that is meant to be taken seriously. Nobody who has seen this anime can disagree with that statement, and if anybody wants to try, your arguments are invalid because #SPOILER ALERT# TWEEEEEEEEEE! #END SPOILER# It's an anime based on A) an absurd idea of psychic cell phones wielded by B) a hilariously disturbed cast combined with C) a silly and arbitrary premise for a battle royale orchestrated by D) a laughable deity with a giant chin,\
          \
        yet its inability to recognize its own inherent silliness results in more than one cringe-worthy moment, usually along the lines of, \"Yuno does [insert horrific/unrealistic action] while saying, 'Yukki [insert affectionate action] me!' with a really creepy smile.\" The sad part is that the exact same scene would have been laugh-out-loud funny if the writers had contrasted the stark, horrifying reality of that image with a 5-second \"bullet time\" of the same scene from Yuno's perspective, which I strongly suspect would resemble a \"Magical Girl\" show where Yuno defeats her enemies with the power of love.\
That aside, the rest story is practically flawless. I was especially impressed by the concept of \"a diary that tells the future\" because it is handled quite expertly. Specifically, it recognizes the paradox of seeing the future--i.e., you can't see the future without simultaneously giving yourself the opportunity to contradict that future--and cleverly works around it: \"seeing the future through the diary via the diary entries that I would have written.\" In other words, the Future Diaries do not truly predict the future, because Diary users are free to disobey their diary entries.\
ART - 8\
Good art with some really standout shots here and there.\
SOUND - 9\
\"Kuso Mesorogiwi\" is still my guilty pleasure. Also, the \"inspired albums\" are nice.\
CHARACTER - 8\
Yuno is amazing and everyone already knows why.\
Yukki is underrated in my opinion. He has such subtle, complex character growth that I think is lost on a lot of people. One of the things I liked most about this series was how Yukki is forced to act braver than he actually is, but eventually he catches up with his braver image.\
Mur Mur is also a brilliant character, despite having a smaller role.\
Deus Ex Machina is only important for his name and his giant chin.\
Most of the other characters are pretty throwaway ... but what do you expect when Yuno and Yukki (more like just Yuno) have to mow their way through ten other Diary users before the end of the series?\
One thing I do like about the characters in general is how deductive and logical they tend to be (aside from a few token idiots). Pretty much all of the Diary users are very clever when it comes to using their diaries, and battles between Diary users tend to focus on preparation, tactics, negotiations, and superior position.\
ENJOYMENT - 10\
I enjoyed it a lot. This is probably one of my favorite animes--and favorite stories--of all time.\

    Ok, this series is fantastic. But it's also heinously demented in a way that only some people are insane enough to comprehend. While even the minor characters such as \"other diary owners\" have very good backstories, THERE IS TOO MUCH RAPE.

I absolutely LOVED Mirai Nikki. This was actually my first time watching a psychological thriller. Usually I try to keep safe and watch action and romantic-comedy with a wee' bit of drama. But I ventured out my comfort zone and I was very impressed.\
The story is a bit confusing, there were times were I had to look-up the plot online, especially when time-travel was thrown in. The only thing that truly bothered me was the main male protagonist being sorta wimpy and winy, having to rely on Yuno through the entire series, except for an episode\
          \
        or two. \
To be quite honest, despite her being insane, I could really sympathize with Yuno throughout the entire series as well, I was rooting for her and her conquest to win Yuki's (Yukki) heart. \

Spoilers are present!!\
Scrolling down my facebook news feed, I've seen pictures of a pink haired girl who looked adorable and at some point she looked completely creepy! which i found very odd. So, when I looked up what anime it was, I stumbled upon the tittle 'Mirai Nikki' . Before watching it, I collected information and read a few details that left me dumb founded. And the curious child inside me made me watch the whole episode only in a day.\
After a few episodes, I told myself that I've\
          \
        understood the blot and the ending is really predictable. Yukiteru and Yuno will eventually kill all the other diary owners, Yuki will kill Yuno and Yuki will become god. And possibly a press of a button will bring Yuno back to life and they will live a happy life. But I was wrong, I have never been so wrong in my whole life! \
STORY 8- The story itself is really impressive. Considering all the twists here and there. There were some parts where the characters seems pretty calm  and laid back after a big disaster happened, and I personally disliked that--they acted as if nothing bad just occurred.\
But I have to applause all the diary owner's story, each individual had a unique and touching story which i love very much. Though it's genre doesn't cover comedy, there were a lot of parts were in i laughed my ass off. 'm giving Mirai Nikki's story a 9 and not a perfect 10 because there were moments as if you feel lost, wondering if you skipped an episode or not. It's story was fast and I admit I hardly kept up with the pace. During episode 18 and above was a bit over the top and made me wonder if i'm still watching the same anime. Though, I really liked the idea of having a future diary :D\
ART 10- The animation is satisfactory, though I really hated how Deus was animated, it seems lazy and he looks like his movements were limited  but I really liked how each characters are designed. Even the coloring and shading is really magnificent. But I was a bit confused with Eight's character design, it had no sense at all.. she was so huge! but the fighting scenes were all good. Especially the expressions ! Yuno's expressions are still widely known all across the internet.  \
SOUNDS 10- The first opening song made it's way to phone's playlist and also my heart. The ending songs were good too ! And I would once again applaud the people who picked the soundtracks, they were all perfect! \
CHARACTER 10- The character development is really amazing and maybe that's one of the many reasons why I liked the anime. Especially, Yuki's character gravely changed after his parent's death and made him more like Yuno which I enjoyed a lot. Even his scumbag father really had a character in him. And Yuno was outstanding, how easy it was for her to cut their necks and stab their stomachs and I really liked how she acts when she snaps out and gains her sanity. She is completely unpredictable! \
ENJOYMENT 9- I really enjoyed watching Mirai Nikki but I got a bit sleepy at some parts. But I really love Mirai Nikki and I'm hoping to watch more YanderexGorexBloodxRomancexContinuumxTimeTravelxFeels in the future!\
OVERALL 9- Mirai Nikki has a unique story and each character has their own deep secrets. The ending was simply perfect and I almost died from all those plot twists. Even after all the years that have passed, Mirai Nikki has engraved a deep mark in the ones who have watched it. \

The series starts off relatively mediocre. I'll admit it was quite a struggle to get through the first 15 or so episodes, but at one point the series magically gets extremely interesting. Its like a lightbulb went off in the mangaka's head while scheming this up.\
Story: The premise of the story is relatively simple. God gives 11 people a \"Mirai Nikki\", a future diary. These people are to kill of one another and the last one standing is to become the new god. But if it was just that I wouldn't have given the story a 7. The plot\
          \
        twists are numerous and unexpected. I marathoned through the last 10 episodes without realizing that I had stayed up all night. This is a thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat, which has never really happened to me before in an anime. \
Art: Good art, characters are drawn well and fight scenes are done well.\
Sound: The bgm is well chosen for each scene and adds emotion to them. I'm a huge bgm buff and I think that the important scenes had the perfect bgm to accompany them. \
Character: Ahh, my favorite part of anime and any story: characters. In this series, the characters start off really static and dull. Yukiteru, the male lead is basically Ikari Shinji. This is basically saying he is the biggest p*ssy ever. The female lead, Gasai Yuno is adorable, but a crazy psychopath. Here is where the series can either make or break. This series managed to show each of the main characters' reasoning on why they are fighting, and why they act like they do. It was a work of art turning what seemed like a disaster into what it ended up being. In the end I was pretty attached to each character, even the psychopath. \
Enjoyment: I gave it a 9 because of all the above. I enjoyed the series and I wish I could watch it again, but all of the excitement is in the thriller elements. So I hope you all enjoy it like I did. \
Overall: Although I enjoyed it, there are still some major flaws in the  plot twists. With plot twists, you have to fill in those holes that you just opened up. That never really happened. Still a good series though, and I would recommend it to anybody who is in the mood to watch something dark and twisted. \

    1st review ever\
The story for mirai nikki is more or less if you were to take death note and fuse it with the hunger games, and it works pretty well. The show has particular fancy of bringing you down when you are up making it a bit of a roller coaster. The ending does't destroy the show but I can see it getting in the way for some people.\
Action anime requires great animation, mirai nikki has amazing animation. The characters like great especially Deus and the world around everyone looks great too. But hey that's not where the animation shines, the fight scenes are. They're\
          \
        bloody, they're gory and they're awesome.\
I can't say much about the dub considering at the time I'm writing this review it hasn't came out but nothing from the trailers say that the dubs going to be terrible and if it is sorry guys... as for the sub everyone sounds great. The OPs for compliment the well, first one coming a little bit on top of the other. The EDs don't work as much but there is something there\
Yukki is a bit of a wuss but he doesn't complains less as the series goes on. Yukkis friends are fine as far as comic relief is considered, except for Akise. AKise is one of the more interesting characters in the show, as for why I can't go into it that much because of spoilers. Ones opinion on Yuno can change with the flip of a dime, you can love her at one moment or hate her at another, is their ever definitive time where you know whether to like her or not? no. With all that being said the character in the series who stands out the most is uryuu minene. I cannot tell you why due to spoilers but know that out of everyone she stands out the most.\
If you have a show where you need to watch the next episode immediately after watching the first episode you know the enjoyment that pursues.\
If your looking for a show with interesting characters and a lot of action this show is right up your alley.\

    Im someone who likes the occasional dark harem \
This series wasn’t a harem.... it was so much better \
I have a couple of roomies and there big on anime like me and this series had me running back and forth  going omg omg dudes guess what just happened \
The story is a deep and dark twist tale... ep 1 spoiler-\
so ok your a loner you have no friends but you record your every day life on your phone but its ok you have a “imaginary” friend call Duex who happens to be the god of time and space.... yeh right (well that’s what you\
          \
        think)\
he has this idea \"ok so you want your life to mean something ill give you the ability to predict your future through your mobile phone, sounds cool, sweet...... oh by the way there’s 12 other people that have this ability as well and you all have to fight to the death so you can take my place as a god but that’s ok don’t sweet the small stuff no biggy.\"\
The story is fantastic and the creativity of the writers is fantastic it keeps you on the edge of your seat turn after turn.\
Yuno the main female protagonist is a great addition to the cast i fell for her \
She’s a devoted cute and sweet character that has a dark twisted and sick personality.. (yes she is both). You’re left asking your self during the whole series, is she friend or foe?\
Would really recommend it if you like a love action with a dark twist\

    MIRAI NIKKI (AKA FUTURE DIARY)\
A very addicting anime, has many positive things as well as negative things.\
Being a survival game type anime, you already know you are gonna be hyped up.\
BUT question is, does it portray it well? = YES AND NO\
YES because the story is quite unique and it is a survival game type anime and so it automatically gets a 9 from me bros. It is quite emotional at some scenes as well and comedy is decent. \
NO because the comedy presented can sometimes be viewed quite lamely, the characters and their designs make me want to puke and vomit so bad\
          \
        sometimes, it just ruins the seriousness and dark tone of the anime. \
Story 9: Win, like I mentioned above, it is about diary holders who have been given diaries and each diary has specific different abilities and uses and can predict the future in different ways. They have to kill each other before the deadline, where the God dies and thus as a result, the world is destroyed as well. For that reason, one winner (a diary user) will have to be the last one remaining so they can become the new God of a new world.\
Art 7: There are some evident mistakes in the art at times, and it isn't really beautiful like some art of some anime can be (e.g psycho-pass, guilty crown and angel beats) and the art is a bit un-elegant and old. it looks childish in many aspects. \
Sound 9: me gusta\
Opening 1 and ending 2 were good, and also the emotional soundtracks that were used during the sad scenes. \
Characters 3: LOL There are like 12 diary users and about 5 die off already in the first 5 episodes when there are 26 LOL. Pacing is done badly, and could have been better.\
 The character designs make me laugh like cow and sheep stock. Makes me vomit on the screen, and piss on the floor. The main boy protagonist is a wuss  and the only likeable character is Yuno, who is a freaky psycho maniac good looking girl with mental issues. The horrible designs of some of the diary holder characters drive the dark and serious mood and atmosphere away from the anime. \
Enjoyment 9: Gets Really addicting like MALTESERS chocolate~\
Overall 9: Sure, why not? it is a good anime despite the flawswhich make you become cows used on a field for agricultural reasons. \

    Okay so first of all: I made a video review (check that out if you don't like reading!)\
---- Read note at bottom ----\
(videos and sound on background is owned by other people! Just my voice belongs to me!)\
So now for the people who do like reading. Or just don't like watching videos\
Storyline&Characters:\
The storyline in combination with the characters really make the anime. The plot is great and can be (for some people) disturbing. However that doesn't change the fact that Mirai Nikki is still an awesome anime to watch.\
In my opinion there is not much character development (You'll have to see for yourself what changes)\
          \
        but that doesn't make the story less interesting whereas it does with a lot of other anime. The storyline really finishes the anime, because in my opinion it's the most important subject.\
Art&Sound:\
I'm not a pro on the art and sound part, however, the art and sounds were fine and fitting! Nice opening and ending song. What made me finish the anime in the end was the intensity and the interest in the storyline.\
Enjoyment:\
In my opinion this is the most important subject. But there's not much to say about the anime. Yes, I did enjoy it. Very much to be completely honest. Here and there it freaked me out but then everything just made a turn and my mind got blown away and it was just awesome (this probably doesn't make any sense, but if you get it, you'll eventually agree with me!)\
Make sure to check out the review VIDEO that  made too!!\
Let me know if this was helpful or not! Not just a 'no', some feedback will be appreciated! Thanks!\

    I love-loved this series! The emotional hooks sunk in deep and I bought it immediately afterwards with no regrets \
Mirai Nikki revolves around Middle-School student Yukiteru, a social recluse, and the \"Survival Game\" he ends up participating in. With the help of a unique \"Future Diary\" Yuki must outsmart the other eleven diary owners to achieve the crown of \"God.\"\
I felt the pacing of events was great, but hiccuped at points, seeming to accelerate and brake to simulate a bit of whiplash for the viewer. Mostly because some characters are lovingly explored while others that are just as important fall by the wayside. Overall though\
          \
        it was enjoyable experience of twists and turns, with the last few episodes introducing a remarkable departure. \
The animation was good, without helping or hindering the series in any substantial way at any point in time.  \
The sound was well-done, though none of the music sticks out. The openings were catchy and enjoyable. I much preferred the sub voices over the dub, I felt that they better represented the characters...\
...which are strong and diverse! As speculation might hold, Yuno is a personal favorite of mine, and I found watching her to be an absolute treat. The main lead can occasionally become overly whinny and maudlin, but this is usually understandable if taken into the context of his character. Otherwise the supporting cast is fun and in many different shades. My other criticism is that some characters end up being thrown-away without much thought because of how little they were developed or had to offer. \
I enjoyed watching the series immensely, and look forward to the possibility of alternate plots and stories that I believe were recently announced!   \

    before i start, i'd like to list what genres this anime includes: action, horror, psychological, romance, supernatural. it does have ecchi, but i'm not including it since it is not your usual sensles ecchi, i say more below. \
\
I started watching this anime because i loved eden of the east and saw that this was supposedly like it. Well, it is the same in that there are awesome cellphones....and thats actualy about the only important similarity there is. Let me tell you now, if you came here because of eden of the east, these animes are basicly completely different. eden of the east is about\
          \
        a nice, cocky guy trying to save the world. it's a happy anime. mirai nikki, or future diary in english, is dark, bloody and there is one twist in the plot after another. and let me tell you this: IT WILL BLOW YOUR FREAKING MIND!!!!\
story:9 \
it has a very good story, there is one plot twist after another, one second you think it's all lovey dubby, the next you will try to pull out your hair because the story got so messed up. the story is not meant for younger children, 14 and up is fine, but there is a lot of violence and blood and grown up topics.\
art: 7\
the art was fine, you'll be satisfied. this anime is often described as ecchi. for those that o not know, ecchi is a term that we use to describe anime, it means that there isn't any nudity in this, but it gets pretty close. fortunatly, this isn't your usual ecchi anime, it is supposed to symbolize that the characters are more grown up,and in one case more insane. again, a lot of blood=don't let small kids see this.\
\
sound:5 \
normally i am very picky about the sound, but in this anime i didn't really seem to notice it. iwasn't actualy paying any attention to it, it doesn't play an important role, and i think thats good. i put a 5 for sound, but i am using it in the sence that 5 is between 0 and 10, i really doesn't matter to this anime, it is insignificent\
\
character: 10\
this is was makes this anime great. the mail main character is good, he goes through some great development to the end. but the female main charater is what makes mirai nikki mirai nikki. she's literaly insane. one moment she is this swee teenageed girl, the next she kills to save her love. she's a stalker, and a sccary one at that. and here's where the action comes in, because it turns out she's also an insanely good fighter. you will be so frustrated with this girl because she pretty much turs arounnd the whole plot every few seconds, you'll never see it coming. this girl will blow your mind, you'll be sitting at the edge of your chair trying to figure out what she'll do next. but yu won't:).\
enjoyment: 10\
i watched this anime in two days, and only because i had a lot of other stuff to do. but every free second i had i watched it. i havn't enjoyed a anime this much in a long time.\
overall: 10 \
this is an amazying anime, don't heitate to watch it.i know that my scores wern't all streight tens, but i had to give it a 10. i read that something like this or a season 2 or something is coming out, and i can't wait. if anyone knows more about this, please don't hesitate to write me. \
\
i'm sorry for any grammer errors or misspeling, i'm in kind of a hurry, but i just had to write this. this is my first review, but i started doing this just because of this anime.\

    I have a question to ask you: what would you do if you could literally read your future? \
I would always know the answers to tests,I would always win at gambles and I would do a lot of other cool stuff. Amano Yukiteru has that advantage and he is able to read his future from his mobile diary but with a cost. If his mobile phone is ever broken he will die. \
But that isn't all. He is forced to play a death game with 11 other people who can read the future in a different way and 1 of those people is his classmate\
          \
        and stalker Gasai Yuno. But he isn't fighting for his life. He is fighting to become the space and time god. The person responsible for this game is Deus Ex Machina and his helper Mur Mur. This Deus guy is about to die so he is trying to find a new god.\
Will Amano be able to survive this death game?\
I finished this anime a year ago and I LOVED it. It's my favorite anime of all time and I got so hooked with it that I have watched it 4 times. The story isn't very original but it got me excited to see what will happen next. \
Some of the characters were really interesting and others not so much. \
Graphically it is very impressive, smooth and clean and the sound is pretty much the same. The opening and ending songs are amazing. So amazing if fact that i have downloaded the on my mobile phone.\
Overall it is a great anime and my favorite and I recommend it to everyone that likes action, supernatural and a little bit of blood.\

    So after watching this anime I can safely say this: Much like movies such as Face Off with Nicholas Cage or The Room by Tommy Wiseau, Mirai Nikki specializes in the art of being so bad it's actually kind of amazing\
Everything about this series is insane to the tenth degree and that's thankfully what makes it so enjoyable: It knows it's beyond fucking stupid but the whole anime plays out like it's aware of that fact and just says \"if we're not gonna make sense then we're gonna have shit tons of fun not making sense\" and that's essentially what I got out of this\
          \
        series \
The premise: What can I say it's every death game competition story you've seen before but what does distinguish it is that the characters are just having such a blast with playing this game and that's where the bulk of the enjoyment for me came from is that I was just having such a fun time watching these people act like total raving lunatics\
Now where do I stand on recommendations of this series? Well unless you haven't been paying attention  the recommendation criteria is pretty simple: If your looking for a balls to the walls fun ass time anime without having to think too hard then this is the anime for you\

The way the Characters evolve just makes you want to watched it even more, And some episodes keep you on the edge of you seat, I wont lie and say this Anime made me laugh, cry, angry (About some of the other player's), upset and sad.\
My favourite\
          \
        character is Yuno because of her personality she has good character development and her past/back storey makes her even more awesome.\
The art style is absolutely amazing and beautiful, the sounds is absolutely outstanding and the enjoyment level for me was though the roof. So if you get the chance do watch the main series  because it is worth the watch and you might enjoy the experience of this Anime\

    Survival anime, one of my favorite genres, I love stories where a lot of people die just to reach the goal of the game, then we have Mirai Nikki, or Future Diary, if you like the dub, which is actually pretty bad.\
Our protagonist Amano Yukkiteru is put in a survival game which will choose who is the new god of time and space, you have to kill eleven players in other to win. The only tool you have to prevent you from dying, is a diary that tells the future and what's to happen to you. Yukki doesn't want to become god or get killed,\
          \
        he later meets a girl named Yuno Gasai, aKa the queen of yanderes, who is willing to kill anyone who touches Yuki, mostly because she's crazy for him.\
Now let me tell why this is on my top 20 favorite anime series.\
First thing to start off is the characters. My favorite character is not Yuno, it's the 9th, Uryuu Minene. She's such a badass and a character that I can relate when it comes to death situations. Another character I admire is Akisa Aru, he may not be part of the game, but he plays a huge role in the series when comes to keep Yukki alive. I like Yuno too, but I wish she was less horny for Yukki. I like Yukki too, he starts off as a wimpy crybaby but he later becomes , determined guy every since, well, the incident happened, but he's a still a crybaby.\
The setting is ideal for a story like this, a normal city in Japan where probably nothing bad will happen, well, you can guess what happens next, lots of psychological shit.\
Overall, a great psychologic survival suspence story with an amazing plot and characters. Defenently a highly recommending serie for people who love survival anime or guys with insane lovesick girlfriends. \

    Mirai Nikki / Future Diary\
    Well, can’t say I wasn’t warned. I read the reviews. But let me tell you, I was not expecting this. For an 8/10 anime, this is easily one of the worst shows I’ve ever finished. Let’s jump right in, shall we?\
First thing’s first, what’s this show actually about? A bunch of crazy people trying to kill each other. A death game, essentially. At a glance, this show is almost like a character study, pitting different personalities against each other to see how they clash. The visuals are alright, if average, and the show is good\
          \
        sub and dub. So what went wrong?\
Pretty much everything, sadly. A big part of what ruins this show is the rating. I was expecting something far more potent and intelligent than what I got. I was expecting something like From the New World or Psycho-Pass season 1. The reality is that this show probably has less intelligence that the first season of Sword Art Online. Allow me to break it down for you. \
\
VISUALS [ 7/10 ]\
    A decent looking show, all things considered. Backgrounds aren’t totally barren, animation is smooth for the most part, although you’ll see some minor inconsistencies- this is another one of those shows where the close-ups look totally different than shots farther away. Future Diary is in no way perfect though. Character designs are shaky, with a lot of inconsistency that makes the anime look like it was made by two different teams. One team is solid and modern, with everything you’d want from an anime with a serious tone. The other is very vibrant, bright, and cartoony. Combine these two together, and you have the earliest warning to the show’s true nature later down the line. \
SETTING [ 6/10 ]\
    Our tale takes place in generic urban area, Japan. A combination of skyscrapers, business complexes and suburban sprawl make up the entirety of the show’s setting, with little in the way of creative or original ideas. Backgrounds are there, but don’t add much in the way of storytelling. This show knows how to set the tone, if nothing else. \
PLOT [ 5/10 ]\
    As stated earlier, this show is very much a death game. With a twist, however. Early on we find out that each of twelve participants possess a future diary, which takes on the form of whatever their original diary was written in. These diaries tell the future, and change accordingly when one of the diary holders changes the future. That is the basis of the game- kill everyone else while avoiding death yourself. The main tool used to accomplish this is, of course, their future diaries. The catch being that nothing unique is brought to the table here at all, other than the fact the participants in this game know the future. In addition, characters seemingly pull weapons out of thin air several times throughout the show, souring an already generic plot. Be prepared for a less than competent chain of events. \
CHARACTERS [ 2/10 ]\
    This is the biggest hit to the whole show right here. At a glance, Future Diary seems to have a unique and... quirky cast of characters. The further you get into the show, the worse the characterization gets, however. Yuki and Yuno, the show’s main pair, are rather inconsistent. Their best moments are often the ones that hurt the most, as both lead C’s get their screentime. With all that time to develop both Yuno and Yuki should be complex, multifaceted human beings with understandable motivatio- Okay, I’ll stop. Look, Future Diary has bad characterization, plain and simple. The entire supporting cast stays pretty much static for the entire show, but I’ll need spoilers to talk more on the supporting cast, so more on that later. Without giving too much away just yet, the cast is generic and disappointing both. You’ll figure out how each character pieces into the puzzle at a light pace. Future Diary will teach you what bad character development looks like, whether you wanted it or not. Absolutely no new ground is broken in this show. The characters themselves are either cardboard cutouts or are so inconsistent you couldn’t hope to figure out what their personalities are really like. Future Diary is definitely one of those ‘turn your brain off’ shows, so if you want competent storytelling, look elsewhere. \
PACING & PRODUCTION [ 4/10 ] \
    A well directed show... Right? Future Diary is alright- on the surface at least. The reality is much worse, to the point where it’s hard for me to explain exactly where the show takes a turn for the worst. Other reviewers describe this show as a trainwreck. Blunt, but accurate. But it’s fun to watch stuff explode. Well, take that clip of an exploding train, and hand the keyboard over to a monkey and you’ve got Future Diary. The pacing is random and disjointed. At the very start, the show seems promising as it seemingly finds its groove. About four episodes in, that groove has smoothed out and the marble just keeps on rolling. To who knows where, because the pacing sucks! Speaking Broadly, you’ll watch 2-3 episodes where crazy shit goes down, and then there will usually be an episode or two where it calms down a little, maybe introduces a character or two. And then back to the insanity, as the plot progresses rapidly and in a way where it’s hard to tell how much time has passed. The show straight up tells you the day and even the time quite often though, so don’t you worry about figuring anything out yourself. The show will handle it for you, which in the case of a thriller, is a very bad thing indeed. Be prepared for blatant stupidity, in addition to the already poor direction the show is taking. Without any further delay, it’s time to wrap review up in a nice little bow. \
STORY [ 2/10 ]\
    Time for spoiler territory. I’ll try to keep things vague, but read on if you want a complete review. If, after all this, you still want to watch the show, skip this section. \
    To truly understand the level of failure Future Diary delivers, you have to know about a few key twists. Which suck, by the way, just like the latter half of the show. My first major complaint is actually one regarding characters. I watched on FUNimation Now, so I saw the blu-ray version. Let me warn you all now; this show has obnoxious fan service scenes. Allow me to paint you a vivid picture from the show. A pair of youths fall in love at an early age, and spend a large chunk of both their lives casually dating. Eventually, this pisses a lot of their classmates off, be it from jealousy or just flat out hatred. Some girls arrange to set up the young love-struck lass, and she finds herself surrounded by thugs, who proceed to start molesting and raping her. The young lass is a girl named Ai, who really grew on me over time. Probably because she was my type, but enough of my personal attractions. Her boyfriend arrives just in time to stop the main course, and beats the hell out of all the thugs. Not before she gets thoroughly molested, however. At the end of this whole mess, the two lovers are sitting outside feeling sorry for themselves. Dudebro feels really bad that he left her side, and through some unrelatable, borderline retarded train of thought he decides he feels bad enough to kill himself. By stabbing himself in the neck with one of the thug knives. Girlfriend leaps over in time to stop him and they cry and be all sympathetic towards each other. There’s another catch, as if all I’ve described isn’t enough. Ai’s shirt got torn to shreds, and so the only thing on her top half is a jacket. When she leaps over to stop another teen suicide, the jacket falls off and camera makes a point of focusing very heavily on her chest. Amazing. Just what I wanted after watching this same cute girl almost get raped. It’s rare for Future Diary to use nudity, but when it does it’s always at the worst possible moment. Distracting, unbefitting and awkward, Future Diary demonstrates yet another part of anime production, and flawlessly shows us all how to do it wrong. \
    Oh yeah, and let’s not forget the scene where the show pervs on a pair of side character girls while they’re in a hot tub. \
    Anyways, let’s touch base on anything I have yet to mention. The gore. So this show has a strange bipolar personality- half the time it’s a goofy, colorful comedy that seems to almost be making fun of this type of normally very serious anime. The other half is, of course, incredibly violent and often gorey. Lots and lots of decapitation in this show, excessive and downright ridiculous death scenes, especially at the end, and an end body count that easily rivals most shows that are actually about war. Future Diary doesn’t know when enough is enough. The writers and directors were absolutely convinced that you just couldn’t get enough of the bloodshed, and so they just keep it coming. They kill off random characters left and right without taking the time to make us care at all, and often in outright stupid ways. They abuse not just fan service but outright nudity, and always with the worst timing humanly possible. The writers couldn’t even come close to salvaging this mess of a script, and no matter how much I think about it I have no idea how this show got the green light to be produced at all. Future Diary is a clusterfuck, through and through. It is the result of throwing a bunch of script writers and screenwriters in a burlap sack for three days straight, and then immediately producing whatever came out of that bag of cats, no matter how awful. \
    Future Diary truly is the perfect example of what bad anime is like, in every way possible. That really is the bottom line here, tragic as it may be. No amount of ‘But look at this!’ or ‘Hey, this particular moment was cool, right?!’ is going to make sitting through everything else worth it at all. The fantastic OP and EDs are the only thing keeping this show from being a 2/10. That’s enough ranting and raving for one review, I think it’s time for the bottom line. \
OVERALL [ 3/10 ]\
Tl;dr-\
Terrible story\
Awful characterization\
Generic Setting and plot\
Infrequent but intolerable fan service scenes\
Messy, half-baked script\
Inconsistent visuals\
And no redeeming qualities to speak of. Stay away from this beast, unless you really want to see what it looks like when a dreadful script curls up in a dark corner and dies. \
    For alternative options, look to Btooom! for your action/survival fix, hit up Danganronpa: The Animation if you’re a mystery/deathgame kinda guy, and go watch Fate/Zero if you want a good thriller/suspense series. Good luck and remember- You were warned!",

    I usually don't make reviews but this anime is really good that triggers me to write my first anime review.\
Story: 9\
I really like the concept of the story. A battle royale where each participant can see what will happen in the future. The last man standing will be the next God of Time. I love each logic and plot twists they emit in every episodes that makes the anime more thrilling. You'll be curious what will happen next so you'll watch then next episode until you'll notice that you are on the DEAD END of the anime.\
Art: 7\
For me, the art is a bit old.\
          \
        But they don't lack of FPS.\
Sound: 9\
Sound is great for me. Voices, sound effects and opening and ending theme fits perfectly in each episode.\
Character: 9\
My  favorite character is Gasai Yuno. She is so cool, scary and kawaii in the same time. She always have a plan and almost can predict the future without looking in her future diary. ( Sorry not mentioning other characters, I actually write a review because of my Gasai Yuno ^3^ )\
Enjoyment: 8\
I enjoyed and loved each episode of this anime. plot twists, concept and ideas makes my brain spin.\
Overall: 9\
This is an anime you should watch if you want something gory, psycho and battle royal. Beware of horrific characters. This anime is my current favorite. Hope you will enjoy them too.\

But now that I have grown...well...\
I can't say much, but, the only thing that bothers me are Yuki and Yuno\
Their existence ruins everything\
Yuki and Yuno are really, but really shitty characters\
Yuki is just useless and dosen't really do much than being the protagonist and winning because he is the protaggonist \
And Yuno is strong because\

    to my surprise, it's pretty average.\
I seriously don't get why did it started as a love story in disguise. Sure Yuno is pretty interesting and her character development is well executed. I still think that she is just the one character that pretty much trying to use Yuki as her only lover to protect (Or trying to kill him in the process). She maybe the one that started the Yandere trope of a nuke and memes, but I just see her as a girl whose mind and heart just goes too far in a person than many people. Should I say that she's the antagonist\
          \
        of the whole series or the protagonist of the series? Either way, I can't tell\
Yuki at first, I thought he's pretty cool. And I did feel sorry for him when the 'hunger games' started. But as the show went on, he's pretty much easily manipulative and a bigger jerk as I can imagine. I mean, geez, why would you trust Yuno over your friends? It's like eating bunch of Chalks over a Pizza. \
Most of the supporting characters and diary holders are cool and interesting. Some good or bad. Reisuke is cute. Has a decent backstory and the character that I like the most. It's too bad that he had to died by Yuno (The one who killed his parents). Marco Ikusaba and Ai Mikami are pretty funny and cool. I did get the feels for them and it's touching but a bit bittersweet I guess. Yuki's friends are cool too, alot of them could've been the central thing that makes Yuki stand up for himself. But nope, the second half blew it and Yuki will forever known as the most stupidest character ever in my book. Even the ones that believe him till the very end like Hinata.\
The ending was, pretty questionable. But you know, the previous world are dead anyway and the third world is normal now. But I was watching those 2 worlds and still left empty.\
Overall, if you like edgy stuff and characters died randomly, this is for you. Just don't get too excited with the story. It's pretty unbalanced.\

    There is always a catalyst that provokes the journey that a person takes to become wicked and twisted. This could not be more true for Future Diary. Yuki is an observer in his own life, not really interacting greatly with the events around him, simply watching and recording the events of his day to day life in his diary on his cellphone. When he finds out that he has been placed in a survival game of life and death with 11 other players, Yuki must  defeat the other players so that he can replace the current deteriorating God of the world. The only twist\
          \
        is…all the other players have diaries of their own, each with a unique ability that depended prior to the commencement of the game.\
In this game, we have two main characters, Yuki and his crazy, stalker classmate, Yuno. With pink hair and matching pink eyes, Yuno claims to be in love with Yuki, yet it’s not clear exactly how far she will go to secure their relationship until Yuki develops the literal skeletons in her closet. \
Yuki, as a protagonist feels way too unreal. At the start of the anime, he was unobtrusive, mostly indifferent, yet also cowardly. When he gets chosen to take part in the game, finally he begins to interact with people and make friends and foes. As he is socially inept, his malleable nature allows him to become a tool in the game, able to be wielded by whoever he can easily come to trust. The viewer is always waiting in anticipation for when he will finally snap and become the victor, by taking a stand for his desire to win the game. The events that provoke this certainly do come, yet his personality switch feels so sudden and unnatural that it messes with the flow of the anime. He feels little to no remorse for the events that follow after he switches off his humanity. The crazy personality that he begins to adopt is ill-fitting because he didn’t have an abusive childhood, mostly a neglectful one, where he didn’t get the attention he most desperately desired. Yuki himself begins to do things without reason which is at war with his seemingly moral personality at the start and the transition does not seem to make the most sense. \
Finally, he finds someone willing to give him the attention, Yuno. Though she is mentally very unstable, can kill with glee and wipe her memory to allow her ultimate ruthlessness, Yuki grows to develop a real connection with her because she goes to any length to protect him. The story is truly about Yuno and the mystery surrounding her because she is able to manipulate Yuki to her will once she establishes a strange sort of trust between them. Yuno is a cleverly crafted character. Though she is mostly a love-sick puppy at her core, desperate herself for emotional support, the journey that she took to become the person that she is in the survival game is an intriguing one that certainly keeps you guessing.\
The well developed characters do not stop there! With 11 other players, we certainly have a lot of names and identities to keep track off throughout this anime. Though some are more forgettable than others, the unique motives behind each character’s desire to become God and the distinguishing character design keeps this anime entertaining. From the creepy and weirdly intelligent Rei, to the seemingly simple, yet complex Minene, to the one with hidden motives, who seems to have his fingers in a lot of pies, Akise.\
There are definitely a lot of characters to keep track off, but this anime does a good job at reintroducing them and weaving them expertly into the appropriate moments of the plot. The art style is really well done in some aspects, especially towards the end when the action escalates with the stunning battle scenes, yet some of the character’s facial features begin to look a bit uniform at some points. The soundtrack is top notch, with the final ending song being my favourite, as it is super atmospheric. \
This anime is dark, twisted and a mystery, yet it somehow manages to weave in moments of comic relief in there. We, like Yuki struggle to hate Yuno, yet still keep her at an arms length after discovering her crazy nature. Go check this anime out to find out who will win the game of survival to become the ultimate God for yourself. \

    Mirai Nikki TV (why is TV there anyway?), aka \"Future Diary\" is a psychological thriller. The anime's basic premise is about a god who gives a dozen players phones which can tell the future. They're ordered to kill each other and the last man standing will assume Deus Ex's place as God. The protagonist is Yuki, someone without friends and anti-social in general.\
The first episode blew me away. It moved quickly and smoothly. It gave us a strong premise. It had strong action and thrills without being mindless. Unique players and a mysterious cute girl determined to help Yuki. Finally, I thought to myself, I've\
          \
        found another masterpiece.\
Well, not quite.\
The story shows a lot of promise early on, yet shortly thereafter some scenarios play out poorly. Not necessarily in their outcome, but in design. More than once, you'll be asking yourself \"How did that happen? Is that even possible?\" It takes away the \"psychological\" part and just turns it into a thriller at times. Some scenes aren't explained clearly and there's even some jumping, making a few parts confusing. The main character is a whiney wimp for most of the story until the final part begins. This didn't bother as much at first- it's a tough situation he was put in, after all- I just wish he would have evolved as a character sooner than he did.\
Mind you, despite all of that I was able to thoroughly enjoy several aspects of the story and characters. Although some characters only last an episode or two and don't receive more than basic backstories, each character is uniquely designed and gifted with interesting diary powers. Yuno, the mysterious, psychotic, cute girl who aids the protagonist Yuki throughout will keep your eyes glued to the screen as you watch her decimate enemies with a knife, and outwit them with her cunning, even while you constantly question her motives and history. \
Action sequences are also a blast to watch despite the suspended disbelief, not due to the action itself but watching the people trying to overcome obstacles with a limited future-seeing ability (or even without it in some cases). And indeed, even despite predicting the final big twist (I got it in the right ballpark, anyway), I was left nearly speechless by it's ending. The story and characters managed to punch me in the gut enough to genuinely care about the outcome, something I can't say about many stories, plot problems or not.\
As already stated, the character design is fantastic, and art is well done throughout. Sound-wise, only one or two tracks stand out. The dub is good and I can recommend it. \
If you can look past some plot problems while stomaching the blood and gore, you'll have loads of fun. Enjoy the mystery, thrills, \"crazy\" romance, and unique characters (mostly Yuno). I give this one a hearty recommendation.\

This is one of my favorite anime of all time!\
It was extremely captivating and had me guessing all the way through. \
Also, although possibly not the case for everyone, this was one of the most moving anime that I have watched and changed my perspective on life and therefore it instantly receives a high score from me. However what gives it my highest score of all time is that it was almost impossible to fault in my opinion apart from maybe the poor development of other characters.\

    The chill and thrill in this anime is significantly amazing! \
Mirai Nikki was never the same to any of the anime or manga i had read so far. The twists are great and the plot is a creep!! It had brought me into another dimension of anime. I could not even remember how many times my heart had skipped a beat throughout the series. It is a great anime for me!!\
The story envisioned on how fates had changed through decisions and evasion from death. The only thing they had? the things they called their Mirai Nikki or their future diary which tells them when ,\
          \
        where and how their lives will end. It was whole lot of mess for a story and as far as i could remember this was the first anime by which i am uncomfortable with the female lead. She was a psychopath and her clingy attitude is beyond obsession, it is already a disease. A cliche beyond hope. \
I am hoping for more of this anime because i am not satisfied on how it ended. The explosive type of plot should also have a explosive type of ending. It is an amazing anime and watching it is not a waste of time. Take it from me.... \

    So, I liked the character designs and the ideal that they weren’t super humanly powered battling one another. Having said that let’s focus on what I didn’t like. \
First, i want to state that I initially dropped this series after 12 episodes. It became clear that Yukiteru and Yuno would be the last two players in the game (that is NOT a spoiler it’s just common sense) and I did not care if they lived or died. Yukiteru is a terrible person and Yuno is worse. But I picked it back up, finished it and now I can conclude this is the second most overrated\
          \
        anime I’ve watched. Yukiteru becomes wishy washy over the whole homicide thing. Sometimes he’s crying and hollering how killing is wrong and takes drastic measures not to. Other times he gleefully commits murder with his own two hands. It doesn’t fit with him being partnered with the human homicide machine Yuno. Either you’re cool with murder or you’re not. One could even be on the fence about it or even feel one way about it then another. But no one switches back and forth on the matter. Yukiteru is a child, I’ll grant you that, but shouldn’t that put him at a huge disadvantage?  Yuno is his advantage, I’ll grant you that too. And the diaries and the manipulation of them are core to their survival. I just feel as though nearly every other diary user would have won this game. But Yuno’s homicidal devotion to Yukiteru got on my nerves. There’s nothing else to her character despite all her backstory. It’s just Yuki and kill. That got boring fast. Back to my first point, I counted four diary users (including Yuno) who simply didn’t kill Yukiteru because, well he’s the main character and it ruins the story if he dies. But that belittles the stakes of the game and the motivations of the other player. Kill 11 others to become god of the new world, what’s the hesitation or hold up? Deus Ex Machina indeed. Maybe I would’ve liked it more when it first came out or I was an adolescent with a grudge against the world, alors I am neither. It was entertaining and annoying at the same time. The end however seemed hokey and contrived when they literally could have had any ening they wanted. Plenty of better anime to watch out there.\

    Just finished this anime. Terrible. My advice would be to skip this anime and watch just about anything else.\
I hate the characters. One of the least likable main characters I've ever seen. He was weak, whiny, wishy-washy. Actually every character was deeply flawed, but not in a humanizing way. Hard to stomach. \
I hate the twists. \
I hate the resolution. Still hated the main character at the end.\
Most of the time I hated the story. It didn't make sense. It required generous leaps in logic. It has too many \"deus ex machina\" (often literally) resolutions whenever the main character(s) got in trouble.\
Having forgotten how many\
          \
        episodes there were, by the time I got to around 20, every time I went to the next episode I kept praying it was the last. I just wanted it to be over. Wish I hadn't wasted my time watching it. Can't understand why it has such a high overall score. Terrible.\

    This was another anime that I finished quickly, two days I think.\
Mirai Nikki, or Future Diary, is... interesting. The character of Yuno Gasai is remarkable. If you want to feel morally ambivalent about liking a character, then see this anime to see Yuno Gasai. This is truly an example of the things we do for love. Is her love for Yuki extreme? Is it justified? This anime is one of the more mature I've seen -- it has its fair share of romance and blood. If you like stories like Hunger Games, Fate/Zero, or other fights to the death, then you'll surely like Mirai Nikki.\
          \
        Time and space are somewhat blurred in this anime -- it has its plot twists and time twists and character twists.\
The sound is good, as all anime OST is pretty much good. The art is not particularly memorable or illuminating but it fits the purpose -- kind of stark, painted-like, which fits the blood and stark reality of the anime. Reality? Hmmm...\
Quite an interesting show. Definitely something to rewatch at one point. The ending brought some tears to my eyes. Love is powerful, that it is.\

    To everyone who likes blood and gore, this is the anime for you!\
Story: A bit confusing to start off with, but by the time you finish the series it all makes sense and has a cool ending. The story is about using cell phones that can tell the future, think hunger games meets the present. As a certain amount of people are selected and have to kill each other, and only one can win.\
Art: The art style is really good! My only complaint was that they censored (blurred out) some of the more gruesome scenes like severed limbs. But i'm guessing when its released on\

        dvd that will probably change\
Sound: In my opinion the OP and ED were terrible goth style music. Granted it does fit the style of anime as it is a really dark demented anime, so i guess it fits.\
Character: Not much to say except i really liked the main characters the supporting cast was good too. \
Enjoyment: I REALLY enjoyed this!! It was super high action and gore, and just over the top from start to finish, really good anime!\
Conclusion: I would recommend this to a mature audience, as it really is pretty messed up. There is ALOT of killing and most of it is just senseless murder. But to those mature folks out there give this one a try! This really pushes the barrier on gory/ horrifying thriller animes. \

    There’s a long review coming…………………\
About the STORY\
The story is honestly somewhat like Eden of the East. It is similar in the sense that it is also a survival game with randomly chosen players who are promised a reward when they become the winner. They are also using cell phones to monitor each other. The thing about survival stories is that the storyline is not the conventional or your everyday kind of story. It is twisted and complicated yet so interesting at the same time. You’ll really have to work your brain with this type of story. The drama is also in the heavy-side as the\
          \
        storyline is really tragic. The original part of it is also the most interesting part of the story which is the unique and so interesting plot. There are countless twists in the story which is really making every revelations anticipating. \
About the CHARACTERS\
Another great thing with survival games are the very interesting characters that comes with it. Because it’s a gathering of complete strangers, each of them has interesting and unique back-story. Each has their own interesting circumstances which led them to use and take the survival game seriously. And if there’s one similarity they have, majority of them are insanely twisted which no doubt making their characters more interesting and exciting. You would anticipate the next twisted and insane things they will do. The protagonist is definitely not your everyday self-righteous, heroic, reliable, and cool type of protagonist. In fact, there is absolutely nothing particularly memorable or special about him. You’ll even get irritated by him at times. And the funny thing is, almost other characters are way more interesting than him who’s supposedly the main character. At least all of them are doing things which they believe is righteous and put their convictions into it unlike Yukiteru who just go with the flow and let others pushes him around.\
About GASAI YUNO\
The most interesting of all is the character of Gasai Yuno. She’s twisted, crazy, smart, scary, and mysterious. She has almost everything a character needs to make them interesting and memorable. Her very unique form of love is what makes her interesting as because it is literally the catalyst to her every action. It’s obviously her strength and makes her really amazing. Oftentimes, her insanity can become comical because she can just say morbid things very casually and acts like its nothing. And even with her craziness, she’s usually right with her suspicions of others unlike the very dumb Yukiteru which keeps him safe. She’s a bundle of mysteriousness as you really can’t tell what she’s up to. She’s the main source of excitement in the series with all her insanities. Her character proves that women are extremely dangerous when they are crazy “in love”.\
About the ANIMATION\
The animation has a strong feeling of “now”. It is quite obvious that it is a latest series. The details to the insane and creepy expressions of the characters are nicely done.\
About the ENJOYMENT\
It’s definitely not the conventional anime. It will give refreshment to your usual and very cliché anime that sometimes makes you so fed up already. Another reason to go back to the anime world. The storyline and plot that the series has is one of the best and one of the most original I’ve ever encountered. And with this series, I found my new favorite character; Yuno. For whatever its worth with all her craziness and insanities, she’s one hell of a very interesting and badass character. If majority of the characters will give you mix emotions, she’s the primary character that will give you so many emotions. I just love her so many different crazy and creepy expressions. She may be badass but I really pity her character. And as much as I like Yuno’s character. I hate Yukiteru’s character so much. One of the most irritating characters and protagonists I’ve ever seen. I’ve never seen a character that gets manipulated and fooled so many times in a series and a protagonist at that. And what I love the most with the series is what it’s trying to convey. This series shows the extent of what human beings can become and can do to make their wishes come true. And no matter how much they justify their actions or put silver linings to their reasoning, at the end of the day each of them are still doings things for their own wish at the expense of the lives of others.",

The only words I can use to describe this show is as follows: Oh. My. God...\
This is honestly one of the best animes I have ever seen, it is a gut wrenching roller coaster ride of drama, betrayal, love and psychopathic murder. When people tell you that Yuno (the Second) is a psychopathic fucking batshit insane character, you just need to watch a few episodes to realize that.\

1.) Yuno will always out crazy herself in a future episode.\
2.) You'll still love Yuno after.\
She's a character you wont just love to hate, but you'll have to love\
          \
        her too!\

    This is one of those series that I would only ever watch once. I liked some of the characters as characters, though i couldn't relate to a single one of them, i still enjoyed them as characters. The first half was great but the second half was horrid, which lead me to create an anime syndrome because I've noticed a trend with this series. And before I start, as will all of my reviews, there will be spoilers.\
Future Diary is about a teenage boy being thrust into a fight to become god against his will. There are 12 other people fighting to become god, some\
          \
        of them for selfish reasons such as the want of power or the ability to cause mass destruction and some for selfless reasons such as helping orphans or ridding the world of crime (yes that was 12's goal). The series revolves around this kid as he is forced, again against his will, to fight along side an insane woman named Yuno Gasai, who is quite literally the worst Yundere in all of anime, but more on her later.\
So time to talk about the massive upsides of this series, it's first half. In the first half we get Yukki putting up with the insane urges of Yuno and her delusions that he agreed to marry her, which he didn't, he said it jokingly 4 years before this series takes place. But we get a lot of good and realistic character interactions between Yukki and all of the other characters in this series, whether he is protecting them from Yuno or being protected by them he always reacts in a way that is realistic and entertaining to watch. And even finding out how each character's dairy worked (the blind man making recordings that talked about crime, the child with a picture diary that allowed him to see what would happen between meal times, and the scroll read by the Shinto Priestess with a horribly sad back story that tells her when people will arrive in her shrine). The first half of this series had a lot to off.\
But as i sit on my porcelain throne like a do when writing reviews I sit and think. Why have I been saying the first half this whole time instead of saying the entire series. Well I'll answer that now.\
This is going to be the first time that I am going to use the term anime syndrome in one of my reviews, because this seriously did start a trend with anime that I've noticed. The first half of this series was great, and if it weren't for the second half it would be on my favorites list. In the second half Yukki turns from a nice guy who actually cares about human life to a mass murdering, child murdering, psychopath. And he goes for Yuno, the person who kidnapped him and put him and tied him to a chair and force fed him soup after drugging him, saying she only wanted what was best for her. And in this part Yuno becomes more insane and literally kills everybody. She goes from an insane human being to a forced villain, who they then try and get you to sympathize with. And he ignores all of his friends who haven't actually lied to him and saved his life on numerous occasions. And the ending is shit, I mean that is the worst ending I have seen. It is a literal Deus ex Machina and i hate it. Though it wasn't as bad as some of other series's second halves. the next bad review is going to be alone the lines of online virtual reality video games that kill you.\

    What is Mirai Nikki you ask?\
Can be answered in one word: YANDERE\
Yandere means obsessive love, stalking, and a certain measure of brutal insanity. \
I have always had a soft spot for totally up-the-wall completely insane anime characters, Haruko Haruhara of FLCL being the first I can remember. But I never knew what Yandere was, or that I LIKED yandere until I watched Mirai Nikki. I was instantly hooked. \
Mirai Nikki's Gasai Yuno takes the insanity cake. A character so insane I'm not sure how anyone cannot be entertained by her. The way she seesaws from cute anime girl to slasher serial killer is trance inducing.\
          \
        When it comes to being insane, cute, and creepy all at the same time it is hard to top Yuno.  \
You are often caught up in the suspenseful mystery around yuno, why is so crazy? why is she obsessed with the male lead? What else is she hiding? As creepy as Yuno manages to be in episode 1, somehow she gets even crazier and scarier the longer the show goes on.\
Throughout the series you are guaranteed to go from feeling bad for Yuno and cheering for her to thinking, 'christ run the hell away!'\
In the end though; everyone loves yuno :D\
My TWO big gripes with Mirai Nikki? The male lead is boring as hell, and once you know all of Yuno's secrets the show has poor re-watch value. It's not one of those shows that somehow blows your mind every time you see it no matter how many times you do. But the first time you watch it... buckle up. \

    Mirai Nikki if I had a phrase to sum up this series it's what the hell did I just watch this romance survival game anime in one word is psychotic manipulative interesting the only flaw is its main character which is yuki poor guy this dude is a definition of a wimp but at least he knows it which I can respect at least. The problem I have with this is there's so much murder in this story  it becomes retarded how they don't get caught by the police but don't get me wrong it's not a complicated anime it's basically  kill or\
          \
        be killed just with phones the premise is basically easy to follow cell phones tell the future in text form protect ur cell phone at all costs or u die winner becomes god pretty simple to follow right the main characters are yuki as previously mentioned is a young boy who is basically a loner and a wimp if I had a nickel every time they had a protagonist that was a wimp in a anime I would be rich lol anyways got no problem with him being a wimp but I did have a prob with not his whiny personality it's his sudden oh my god he grew some balls in late in the series cuz I'm so used to the main character being a pussy that him being a sort of bad ass is just down wierd and hard to comprehend but I guess if u have to grow some balls eventually right if its kill be killed right well anyways his cell phone is pretty standard tells the future blah blah on to the other main character which is yuno she is what u called a yandere but a psychotic one with a touch sweetness wrapped around with her obsession and stalker issues and much more she kinda creeps me out but anyways she is part of this series because she is madly in love with yuki to the point it even creeps out the boy too and both hold future diaries the whole survival game is 13 cell phones tell the future given by god named deus kill everyone that has one of those 13 cell phones or future diaries till one is left and he or she becomes god simple and straight to the point well all can say without giving u any spoilers it may annoy u sometimes but will never bore you so peace that's all \

    Personally I've never read the manga of Mirai Nikki, like many others, an such I review it as the main anime, not comparing it. The story of a boy, who, by God, receives a Future Diary. That alone makes quite a chance for a good story, yes, but it is not even close to what this is about. Yes, those diaries create all the situations, but, in my opinion what this really is about is... Yuno.\
Past her having a diary too (and it being only about the main character, Yukiteru), she would do about anything for him. And that's where the fun begins.\
From killing dozens\
          \
        of people here and there, having a twisted love and basically living because of him.\
Why see it? Yuno. She is the main character, the way the story turns because of her, knowing how she will react but at the same time don't knowing what's going to happen really makes a good story. The way her mind process works, at knowing the weaknesses of the other diaries, and owners, really works up for a good anime.\
So if you want to she a pink haired girl chopping some people off (that's what it is about most of the times), saving a boy who cries every once in a while and doing it nearly without breaking a sweat, I'd say this is for you.\

    This will be my first review, so this may be kinda subjective/wrong on some aspects, but this is what I thought.\
This was something definitely worth watching. I watched some other anime, which were more fighting-based, but this anime did that in a different way. The fights are not going all out and smashing other people's heads in, but instead they're quite tactical. It's exciting to watch every \"fight\" and they all seem to have a small plot twist in them, which made the anime very enjoyable and anything but stale.\
The plot twist you get at the ending completely stunned me, just by how unexpected it\
          \
        was to me. The last few episodes are a good ending to the anime, and they satisfied me.\
I say that this is definitely worth watching: 8/10.\

    So... I've completed this anime today and I just want to write a short review about it. I'm not really into this thriller genre but I've found this one quite interesting so I've decided to watch it. I found that like after the 3rd episode it becomes also a little addictive. I had all the time a feeling that it's really similar to Deadman Wonderland, which I really disliked, but luckily this turned out to be a lot better for me.\
The story is quite ok. Well, I don't really like the main idea of the survival game and all but I admit that most of\
          \
        the shocking or at times disgusting events are necessary for the character development. What makes the plot actually pretty great are the several twists and the unpredictability of the storyline. Whatever you think, you can be sure that the anime won't fail to surprise you. Also, the idea of the future diaries brings with it that you can expect some ingenious tactical moves. (Sorry for comparing again but I couldn't help to mention Death Note and Code Geass at this point. While they are mainly based on strategies, Mirai Nikki is more like a perfect mix between genres, including the one with a genius MC with supernatural abilities.)\
The MC, Yukiteru seems most of the time a little pathetic but he is the most realistic character in the whole story, so you can say it's quite normal that he just won't act like a badass. Yuno's character development, on the other hand, is really exciting to watch. Most of the characters are really well-made. Most of their deaths or their situations at the end of the anime turn out to be a satisfying alternative. This is what keeps this anime from sliding  into the ultimate thriller genre and what makes it enjoyable also for people who like the shounen-type stories more. \
So overall I would rate it 9. Because once you start watching it, you'll just have to finish it.\

    A survival game involving handphonnes and diaries? Well then, mine would only be useful for telling cup sizes of women I'm about to meet, nothing more.\
So, Mirai Nikki. This is in fact another one of those animes which I sincerely enjoyed. I mean the concept if it is amazing and it somehow correlates with the real world. Don't believe me? Smash that smartphone of yours and see if you can survive. Dickhead.\
Aaanyway, Mirai Nikki presents an interesting and well thought out storyline. Its never boring and it has that mysterious vibe that keeps it going and peaks the audiences' curiosity. It also has an intersting\
          \
        script.\
The art and visual effects make this anime all the more better with their creative dynamic lighting and light ambience. This make Mirai Nikki all the more fun to watch.\
The sounds and ambience on the other hand always fit the scene and is never annoying to listen to. Although it is not as wow as Guilty Crown, its something.\
Ah, the plus point and minus point of this anime on the other hand would be the characters. Mirai Nikki features interesting and unique characters, each set with their own special personality and that makes them one of a kind and not like your typical anime characters. BUT there are certain characters which make me sick and on the top of my hate list would be Amano Yukiteru, the main character. The dude is a f*cking crybaby and it makes you wanna kick him in the balls....IF HE HAS THEM! Next would be the yandere charecteristics of two of the characters and that really bugs me. But other than that, its all good.\
The enjoyment factor is there and this anime has managed to become succesful even without a comedy factor. Good show! The violence factor is at a medium level and the fan service is at a minimal level (unless you like fapping to pink haired school girls in bikinis, you sick bastard).\
In short Mirai Nikki is a good anime to watch and is also a worthwhile one. Suitable for teens and adult or the like. 8/10.\

    1st thing first, this story contain many gore scenes so I don't recommend kids under 15 years old watching this.\
 Story:\
To me this romance story is just different from the others. There are many twists in the story which 1 find it interesting because it made me want to think of what would happen next even tho in some cases is not logic that came to play. It's just hard to guess of what the story is leading to but that what makes this anime intresting.\
 Art:\
The art is fine.To be honest I hate seeing blood been shed too often so it makes me the\
          \
        uncomfortable feeling while watching this. For you people who don't mind seeing people being killed in this anime  then this anime has a good story for you to watch.\
 Sound:\
not much sound effect or that kind of stuff. It would be thrilling if there are more background songs before the kill or stuff like that.\
 Character:\
The character development was very good: their past n reasons of being in the scene were very detail.\
 Enjoyment:\
I quiet like the mystery solving story of this anime but i hate the gore soo much and the last 3 episodes were so dramatic almost made me cry. So overall the enjoyment was fairly good, worth the watch!\
I'm a beginner review writer so if there're mistakes or comments please don't hesitate to give me feedbacks and comments. Thanks! Enjoy Mirai Nikki!\

    To start off with, let me just say that this is the most THRILLING, INTENSE, AND MYSTERY UNRAVELING SHOW I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME! THIS SHOW HAS SOO MANY STRONG POINTS THAT DRAWS ME INTO IT AND MAKES ME LOVE IT EVEN MORE! The story is very original and not like any other I've seen. The art is very vivid and great; and the sound effects and music makes it spine-tingling ;P \
The characters each have unique personalities that makes the story more alive. If I had to say it, the only weak point of this story was that the main character, Yukiteru\
          \
        Amano, was too wussy and always scared of things, so he always had Yuno to protect him. Overall, I give it a 10/10! I HIGHLY recommend this to people who love suspense and thriller animes.\

    Mirai nikki aka future diary is a mystery/suspense/horror, all packaged in a love story. (a twisted messed up love story). pretty good. full of ecchi tho, not sure if ur into that(not judging) so maybe its not for all crowds. But excellent ending, really all comes together at the final episodes. you will be smacked by that ooooooooooooh moment towards the end. \
This anime follows a young boy whose anti-social behavior brings him an obsessive girlfriend. Together they enter a contest(not willingly) for the right to be the next god (each contestant has a future diary that tells them the future, which each contestant uses\
          \
        cleverly to try to win the contest). \

    First of all let me say this is my first review, so keep that in mind.\
Story: 10/10\
This story is brilliant in my opinion.  Without revealing anything I'll say it's like the anime version of the hunger games (the manga was written first, I am aware) except instead of simply trying to survive, the participants are also trying to become god of time and space and stop the apocalypse from happening when the current god, Dios, dies.  There were plenty of twists, some are a bit more obvious than others, to keep me interested through the 26 episodes.\
Art: 8/10\
The artwork was really good. \
          \
        I only gave it an 8 because I think only anime that have as detailed of artwork as Vampire Knight (not the best anime, but definitely has gorgeous artwork) or are as appealing to the eye as Fullmetal Alchemist deserve 9's and 10's.  Mirai Nikki was not quite as complex as those two and therefore only received an 8.\
Sound: 9/10\
I'm assuming this means music.  I loved the first opening song (Kuusou Mesorogiwi ).  It's one of my favorites now.  The second ending song (Filament) was also really really good.  The soundtrack itself fit the theme nicely, but I'd have to say it wasn't my favorite.  It deserved a 9 for the mood it accomplished, but not a 10 purely from personal preferences.\
Character: 9/10\
Again, this is only personal preference.  I was a huge fan of the character development.  Every character developed in some way.  (People may argue that Yuno doesn't develop, but just watch how her crazy factor increases.  That is also development)  The best development was Yuki's.  His transformation from my most hated character to a pretty cool one started around episode 14, where events conspired that will not be revealed.  But the real turning point occurred at episode 18.  Yes, he was constantly in a state of development throughout the entire series; those were just the moments that he developed into a character that I personally liked better.\
Enjoyment: 10/10\
Call me sick, but I really enjoyed this anime.  The suspense was great, the action was well drawn, the voice actors were good.  It made for an enjoyable anime.\
Overall: 9/10\
That seemed to be the average of what I rated everything.\
I would recommend this anime to anyone who enjoyed Higurashi or the Hunger Games or something similarly themed.\

    From reading the synopsis, this show The Future Diary doesn't sound all too appealing. The Future Diary is filled with twists and turns which will stop you from predicting the end. The story was great (9), it kept me interested in it. After watching each episode I just kept wanting more. The sound and art (9) were really good. The characters are well drawn and the voice actors were great for their characters. I pretty much liked all of the main characters, which is why I give it a (9). There will probably be one or two characters you will dislike, but most of these\
          \
        characters are likable, although there will be one specific character that you will find yourself from time to time asking if you are fond of them or not. Enjoyment (9), I really did enjoy this anime, there were 26 episodes which is long enough and it kept me well entertained. It also kept me guessing on what's gonna happen next. Overall (9) the only reason I rated this a 9 is because of the ending, but I really did enjoy watching this. I recommend this to anyone who's looking for drama, action, a little romance and an anime that's a little psychological. \

    Outstanding anime. I just watched it in 1 day.\
 The story is simply amazing. It's quite obvious (at least for me) 'till the end, that made me mourn (I don't usally mourn with an anime :P)\
The art is quite simple (tons of blood everywhere that's why I love it so much). It's really traditional way of drawing manga (not crazy stuff). Although I decided that a 9 would be fairer because it needs more kind of drawings (not just the typical long-faced big-eyed guys).\
The sound is AMAZING. The first intro is just too awesome for a human. The first time I heard it was like\
          \
        \"fuh what's this? I'll skip the intro\". But the second time I was like \"*w* OMG That's too damn good!\". And the story music is amazing too. Everytime there was X moment the music was outstanding. It would be the kind of music that I would put in that moment.\
And finally the characters are *w*. Really, I've no words to describe them. I really love Yuno, and Yuuki it's a bit baka, but it's k. You'll see when you begin to watch it. \

    It's an anime that everyone would enjoy. If you loved Eden of the East and Elfen Lied, then you would love Mirai Nikki too. The ending left me all curious and with a lot of thoughts.\
Story: Very entertaining plot twists, something like a japanese version of Hunger Games. Anyway, it's a game and only 1 person out of 12 can survive and take the place of God. That's what makes the story so good and addicting. \
Characters: The side-cast in particular really needs a long while to get going, but in the end, the character development is pretty good all around. There is a lot\

    So, first of all, I would like to compliment Mirai Nikki of it's success on making me a fan of Yuno.\
I think the story is pretty good. There are things that I would never consider of happening and surprised me. Though it focuses mainly on the main characters, it manages to cover the stories of other characters. This is good, because it would make the viewers understand better of each character. But there are some parts that are not logical and seems pretty forced.\
In my personal opinion, there are not enough action here. The action scenes are not long enough. The action only lasts for\
          \
        about 3-5 secs and that's that. This is a shounen anime, but most people thinks that this is shoujo. Probably because of the lack of action. Not that I really mind it.\
But then again, Mirai Nikki is one of my all-time favorite anime.\
I personally think that the anime is doing very well on bringing the emotions out of the viewers. There are scenes of gore and craziness, of course. But there are also sad, heart-warming scenes on it. The anime is not all about insanity. It also carries an amount of good things.\
The humors are also nicely placed. I can laugh, cry, and enjoy them all the same watching this.\
I would say that this is a must-watch anime for those who haven't watched it.\

    Mirai Nikki, for the most part, is good. The story is thrilling, interesting, and not too predictable. The art and sound are good. However, the characters really bring this anime down for me.\
I won't talk about the story, art, or sound, since I'm sure you can gather that from other reviews, so I'm mainly going to focus on the characters.\
I really didn't have too much of a problem with most of the characters, since they were interesting and entertaining, but let's talk about Minene Uryuu and Amano Yukiteru.\
Minene Uryuu, while she was cool and awesome, doesn't really act her character. In the earlier episodes, she's\
          \
        seen as a sadistic terrorist that's really weird and obnoxious. For the next few episodes, she sort of becomes a recurring bad guy. However, by the end of the show, she's portrayed as a mature, mother-figure who's selfless. Wow. What a change. So, that was bad, but not nearly as bad as the next thing...\
Yukiteru. First off, Yukiteru was interesting and unique enough in his attitude towards life during the first episodes. However, Yukiteru gets more and more unrelatable and WTF later on. Gasai Yuno does something to Yukiteru that's completely unforgivable and wtf she should get arrested and put in prison for life for what she did. But Yukiteru forgives her... and ends up falling in love with her... to the point that he'd give his life for her. That would never, ever happen in a million years, and this really makes the audience think, \"what the hell is yukiteru thinking.\" So, Yukiteru's annoyingly undying trust for Yuno, really, brought this show down. Most of the time, I was just screaming at Yukiteru because of how stupid he was. And near the end, after a very thrilling and dark series, there's an episode that goes all rom-com on you and you're like wtf is this I'm watching the Future Diary not School Rumble. (School Rumble is good rom com i liek show)\
So, with character problems and an episode that put the brakes on this action train way too hard, the show's thrilling plot and good art/sound are pretty much negated. I give this show a 6/10. It's fine. Not bad, not good. Fine.\

    Very enjoyable show, with fantastic characters and very well done animation techniques. \
The first 30 seconds of the first episode were a bit off-putting but after that, I enjoyed every minute of it.\
The romance, art, drama and suspense parts were all really well done, with the pacing of the show done ",

    A show about 12 people who can predict the future fighting to the death. Tell me that did not sound awesome! \
Now yes I just explained the premise, the story is not too big, it`s just 12 people fighting to death, with one of them already dying in episode 1, the show is very gory, with blood lots and lots of blood. Even the openings are full if blood, heck the OVA opening is about things turning into blood. It also has a horror element to it, and a lot of times it even turns into thriller/mystery, and it`s also a bit of a psychological\
          \
        anime. The animation is great, it especially shines with blood, cause as I said earlier, they seem to love it a bit too much. The sound is great, the voice acting I superb, they feet almost perfectly, and while the dub only has 1 episode out, and is A LOT DIFFERENT THEN THE SUB, it is non the less amazing as well. And all the songs they have are just superb. The characters are probably the strongest thing about this series, as they are all very different in there own way, and not the type of characters you see in a lot of anime. Well except for the main guy...I enjoyed this anime a lot, and I guaranty that as long as you got the stomach for it, you will enjoy it as well, cause there is a lot of horror & gore in this show. Overall it`s a good show but not good enough, it ended with a lot of deus ex machine moments ( but I guess I should have expected that, considering that the one who started that deth mach is called deus ex... ) and because of that I have to give this anime an 8 out of 10!

    This is a masterpiece for me even though I'm not even the strongest fan of weak protagonists like Yukki, but Future diary beautifully describes what I believe one of the best depictions of forbidden love combined with an interesting battle of wits and intellect in a game to become god. At first I was put off by Yuno in the beginning of the show, but as the story unfolds and you learn more about Yuno, I began to sympathize for Yuno and what she goes through. Even towards the end of the show I was rooting for them to be together. I think Yuno says\

        it best towards the end, \"What's insane is that we can't be together!\".  \

       I have read the manga first, but don't worry no spoilers that I know of. For what I have seen, the anime followed the manga, practically all the way through! I am quite glad, since no t all animes do that. Like... dunno. I can't think of any on top of my head. \"sigh\" \
   Whatever, I love all the characters! My favorite character is Minene Uryuu! I love of tsudereness! If you didn't know yet, I love tsuderes!\

        to pee my pants. I get freaked out like that. But Mirai Nikki doesn't scare/ I thought it'll be a lot scarier. The only thing that I could see this would be a horror anime is because of Yuno Gasai. \
   I can definitely see why, but she doesn't freak me out. At the same time, if I was 10... I would be freaking out then.\
   Other than that, check this awesome anime out! Cool plot line how cell phones are used. Plus the cellphones aren't like iphones or androids, so to me that is even cooler... dunno, whatever\

    Love requires some blood, time travel, and future dairies.\
AUTHOR'S NOTE:\
Mirai Nikki is not a predictable anime. I watched the anime without knowing a single thing except that there was a yandere involved, which interested me at first. My expectations for this anime has been far exceeded as I made my way to the final episode. It is recommended that you read the manga first before indulging in the anime, as it will surely bring more understanding to the nature of the plot. Hopefully, this review will give you a good sense of why it is recommended for those who love anime. \
STORY (8/10):\
Mirai Nikki begins\
          \
        as a battle royale for the crown of the god of time and space. Dues ex Machina, the supernatural being and his servant, Murmur brings 12 chosen players together to kill each other Super Smash Bros. Melee-style, with Sakurami City as the battlefield. It is revealed that this battle royale has been specifically decided in order to replace an aged and dying Dues ex Machina, to prevent universal catastrophe and destruction. Armed with their own unique future diaries, weapons that transcends time and space, the 12 \"warriors\" are commanded to face each other to their dying breaths, until one stands victorious. With blood and violence being the main assets to the anime, Mirai Nikki surprisingly does a great job with story development. Every character is important and has had some sort of influence to support the grand scheme, which allows the anime to be a formidable psychological-thriller of its own kind. The twists and turns in the anime are heavily disturbing and many times, eerie, as it deals with psychopaths, serial killers, terrorists, and masterminds. \
Unfortunately, the anime is not perfect and merely matches up to the manga. If the anime was swiss cheese, it would be the most flavorful, as is its full of large plot holes that will confuse and belittle viewers if they are not aware of the manga. The characters seem to dodge unfortunate deaths with ease, until their \"time\" is up, and leaves the viewers out of the picture with no explanations. However, Mirai Nikki does paint the atmosphere of \"thrill\" quite well, revealing twists and cliffhangers at the end of each episode, so the audience will bound to be at the edge of their seats.  \
ART (7/10):\
The animation is predictable, but it is fairly well-played. Explosions and actions scenes are reinforced with fluidity and viewers will never miss out on them. However, censorship seems to be a big issue, as there are quite a few of them, especially when dismemberment of limbs are involved which sometimes takes away the reality of the anime. Understandable, as the anime world is now entering the regulation era with garbage lobbyists trying to prevent \"kids from being influenced by violent animations\". It is also notable that CGI is largely used, which can indicate laziness, but with 26 episodes filled with chaos and violence, Mirai Nikki does a fairly decent job of keeping itself natural.\
SOUND (9/10):\
\"Kūsō Mythology\" by Yōsei Teikoku is one of the best OPs I've heard in anime. It begins as a sorrowful melody then quickly transitions into a violent gothic-metal sound that perfectly paints the nature of Mirai Nikki. With the animation adding to the mix, the OP blatantly describes to the audience that the anime will be a violent pandemonium, and without a doubt, it is. \"Blood Teller\" by Faylan also does its job extremely well, with a creepy sample in the beginning and the riffing of electric guitars to back it up. That sample never fails to bring some sort of chill down my spine. And that end card, with all 12 characters as silhouettes, it has become one of my favorite EPs in anime. Faylan's soulful and clear voice can only make the EP much more dark and epic at the same time.\
The second OP, \"Dead End\" by Faylan surely targets the audience with an emotion that any psychological-thriller anime can only invoke. It has a pure metal-rock form and with Faylan's lyrics accurately describes what the audience will be indulging in. \"Filament\" by Yōsei Teikoku is the second EP and is a tragic song that brings Mirai Nikki to a tight close as the anime speeds towards the climax. The sound of Mirai Nikki is definitely the stronghold of the entire anime as it entices viewers and provides a psychological-thriller atmosphere that not many animes I've watch can rival.\
CHARACTER (8/10):\
Mirai Nikki's character development is profound and discerning. I won't go too much into details and will only cover the hero/heroine, as explaining more may give away spoilers. However, I will say that the support characters are extremely detailed and important to the story. They are all badasses in their own rights and are highly capable of being favorites compared to the main characters. Although we are forced to focus on the hero/heroine, the other characters have their own unique history and personalities that makes Mirai Nikki an imposing anime for those that thirst for a good storyline.\
Our heroine (or should I say, anti-hero), Yuno Gasai is one of the sole pillars the holds the entire anime from crashing down to the ground. A complete insane psychopath, stalker, and murderer, I have realized that it is not an understatement when one claims Yuno is the \"goddess of Yandere\". Whenever I need to describe a yandere, I point to a female figure with pink hair with twin locks in her hair and a knife in her hand. Yuno's character development is dead-locked and has a convulsing twist that not many yandere characters have up their skirts. In addition to her perverse personality, she is also extremely intelligent, manipulative, observant, and a versatile fighter which makes her one, if not the most dangerous character in Mirai Nikki. Her feats will not only impress viewers but her devised plans, accompanied by her tragic history, makes her one of the most interesting anime characters that I've ever set my eyes on. Her distorted personality and actions are uncommonly unique but intensely likeable. It makes me want to PIN HER TO THE GROUND, RIP HER SKIRT OFF, AND RELENTLESSLY FUCK HER AND MAKE HER CRY OUT MY.....AHEM.....cough.....\
.....\
SHIKASHI.....!\
The utter failure that is Yukiteru \"Yuki\" Amano makes me want to vomit piss and blood, then use my excrement and bodily fluids as an alternative to gasoline to burn Yuki with hellfire. Our hero is the mistake in Mirai Nikki, a defected, disposable product that the producers created. As the main character, Yuki is a boy who has strayed the social path of normalcy with his cellphone \"diary\" as his only escape. It is unknown to my knowledge why Dues ex Machina chose such a worthless piece of trash to be the \"First\". A complete coward and a baby at body, mind, and soul, it saddens me that Yuno has chosen to protect such a creature. When we think sheltered, Yuki is the best representation that I can come up with. Sure, Yuki does have some appreciative moments but his character development is arguably the most anti-climatic and disappointing. Throughout the anime, Yuki never fails to piss the viewers off with his ignorant and selfish actions which only makes us want to wish death upon our main character, even at the end of the anime. Too bad he's protected not only by the most badass character in the anime, but also by the plot holes. \
OVERALL (9/10):\
Mirai Nikki was definitely a thrill and I've enjoyed the anime until the very end, despite the plot holes and the unimpressive hero. The anime has a reminiscence of the Japanese cult-classic \"Battle Royale\" and it is also a love story that literally crosses dimensions, which can be a cliche, but still an interesting take, in addition, a well-deserved break, with the sudden increase of \"slice of life\" animes this year. I highly recommend the audience who are looking for something different (or violent) to pick up Mirai Nikki, as it foretells a fun, exciting, but perplexing story about an obsessive love gone wrong.\

    people that watched this anime seem to be of 2 types. those that loved it, and those it was awful.\
so that really got  me thinking, when i first watched it about half a year ago i fought it was great, and one of my fav animes, but when i look back at it its not that good as i fought it was.\
alot of the reason that i liked it so much i think is because of the music, it fits so well and sounds very good and i also often listen to it outside of the anime.\
i also really liked yuno as a character\
          \
        because of her totally being crazy, but the romance i did not like that much (but im just not a big fan of romance) the story what something that while i liked it even watching it the second time, it is actually true that there are alot of plot holes here and things that just flat out don't make sence. That being said, there was still a feeling that i can't quite explain but just kept me watching and kept it nice to watch.\
So to round up this review i think its a fun averige anime that is nowere near as bad as some people say, and nowere near as good.\
Im sorry if this review is kind of a mess, im still learning! i hope you enjoyed reading and please tell me if you think im right or wrong and what you fought of the review :)\

    Discussion:\
\"I laughed, I cried, I puked a little.\" Mirai Nikki is a thrill ride you'll never be able to get off of - whether you want to or not. Is it fun? Hell yes. Is it scary? Beyond belief. Is it sickening? Exquisitely. So if you enjoy rough turns and unexpected loops, disorienting corkscrews and dizzying helixes, then get on the Future Diary train. But if you're susceptible to any and all the things that make films R-rated, you might want to prepare yourself mentally first. This show will always take the laser to 11. If you aren't disturbed by this anime's content, then you\
          \
        probably aren't disturbed by anything at all. That being said, its enthusiasm in contriving absurd and thrilling scenes is so over the top that its plot becomes unrealistic and incomprehensible, and if you can't look past this fatal flaw, you won't enjoy the anime very much.\
Mirai Nikki's strongest quality by far is shock value. If you don't like being creeped out, don't even bother with this anime; it thrives on your discomfort. Without going into too much specific detail, I'll try and cover as many reasons as possible why it is so successful as a thriller. I'd tell you to expect the unexpected, but even with that mindset I found myself completely thrown off every single time a development in the story (or a scene) is made. Based on popular knowledge of the premise and the character Gasai Yuno, one is led to believe the anime would follow the direction of a generally comedic, cute, slice-of-life romance. Well, thirty seconds into the first episode would throw any expectations of that out the window. Even the synopsis on this very site explains that the story is a psychological thriller based on a psychic battle royale.\
But as soon as you think have a grip on what direction Mirai Nikki is going in, your expectations are instantly flipped. Battle royale doesn't even begin to explain the the series. Elements from many other genres, including slice-of-life, pop up extemporaneously throughout the anime. Zooming in, individual scenes are equally spontaneous and unpredictable. In fact, the one thing remains constant throughout the show is how quickly it can take a stunning turn in a matter of seconds. Between unexpected visual gags, vicious combat sequences, absurd gore, spontaneous nudity (usually clue-nudes), along with plot twists from hell, devastating backstories, and cringeworthy embarrassments, the series keeps you on your toes... and then makes you wonder if you still have toes.\
For all of that which works for Mirai Nikki, it can also be overwhelming. At times it's possible to become completely lost, due to the fact that there's very little consistency to the character of the show. While its capriciousness makes it fun and exciting, at the same it renders it almost unfollowable. There are episodes that make you wonder what the hell you're actually watching. Ecchi? Action? Romance? Shounen? Shoujo? The only consistently accurate answer is thriller. Even scenes which are entirely innocent and chipper on the surface are waiting to explode with spontaneous incredulity. The show is so erratic, it's not humanly possible to keep up with its behavior. Although Yuno is perhaps one of the better known examples of Yandere, I'd argue that the show itself is Yandere. Its juxtaposition of fan-service and bloody gore is almost incomprehensible. Does the mercurial nature of the series' storyline make it hard to follow? Often. But if you bear with the genre-hopping and general helter-skelter, the enjoyment reward is well worth the effort. A thriller at the core, this anime will keep your fingers clenched, spine chilled, blood curled, and eyes glued to the screen. \
I've gone on about its shock value enough, so I'll address the flip-side, which may detract from your enjoyment of the show. The show, for all of its whimsicality, is ultimately incredulous. Since many of the characters are literally insane, you have to suspend disbelief 90% of the time. This detracts from some of the more serious content by undermining its credibility. The characters' insanities are usually partially explained, but not to a degree which is satisfactory for a story that claims to take itself seriously. It would've benefitted considerably from more attention to detail with regards to its characters, and making them more believable would've helped it deal with the more serious subject matter. Some of the characters are explicitly archetypes or absurd exaggerations of such, while others have a single unique trait that carries their personality, which generally makes them seem somewhat shallow. There is one exception to this criticism: I found a certain diary holder (Minerva) to be by far the best-written character in the show. Since the reasons why are a minefield of spoilers, I won't go into detail. \
On the upside, there is at least one unique quirk for each of the entire cast of diary holders. What's most interesting is how this quirk determines their prophetic diary's abilities. For example, Yukiteru (the main character) has long kept a diary in which he wrote random events in, so naturally when it became endowed with foresight, it began prophesizing future events in his surroundings randomly, with its one exemption being his fatal weakness. Yuno is of course a highlight of the show, and although I felt her character was ultimately unfulfilled, her personality and her diary's powers are what drive the show towards insanity. I won't give spoilers, but the first three episodes should be enough to get grasp on how much fun she is. My personal favorite thing about the diary holders is their discreet parallels with the Roman gods of the Dii Consentes. Each has personality, history, or at least symbolism which goes along with their pantheon counterpart. In case you're wondering, in this review I'm referring to diary holders based on their equivalent deity to avoid spoilers - they aren't officially revealed in the anime, so it shouldn't be a problem unless you look it up on the wiki.\
The plot of the show is engaging enough, but definitely isn't one of its strong suits. I mean, at least it isn't shy about employing lazy writing - there is literally a character named Deus Ex Machina, after all. Divine intervention is consciously used way more times than necessary. The entire premise of the plot rests on will of a god to make it so. There is at least some motivation for Deus, but regardless, if there's a supreme being pulling the strings, the plot naturally loses dramatic tension. The flimsy plot construction gets even worse around the time you meet the equivalent of Dionysus, and you really have to wonder who would ever think it would be a good idea to give so many people power over the future and incentives to kill one another. The plot was fun and interesting, but to enjoy it, you have to forgive its flaws, which are pretty major.\
Fan-service tends to take over the plot more often than I would've liked, and I think it would've benefitted from making a decision to favor either fan-service or good writing. A lot of the show is 'just for fun', which would be totally fine by itself. However, it also seemed to overexert itself by trying to make everything fit into a neat and clean plot, after spending twenty-odd episode making it a mess. It suddenly takes itself very seriously, after having most aspects of the story be completely unrealistic. It's so incredible that it's hard to take the most dramatic aspects seriously. This weakened some of what was intended to be its strongest plot points towards the end of the series. That's not to say the ending was bad - in some regards it was amazing - but if failed to live up to the standards it set for itself in terms of conclusion because it didn't allow itself to make enough sense. It asks you to suspend disbelief at one point and then suddenly has you take everything for literal fact. I obviously can't specify what exactly bothered me about the ending, but often, the show tried to make the incredible credible, and although that has huge payoff when done successfully, it didn't work out because everything, from the characters, to the setting, to the storyline, felt contrived and unrealistic.\
Themes throughout the series were surprisingly well done. For a slasher thriller, that's a rare gem. The characters that were done well brought so much depth into the story, and even minor characters contributed meaningful vignettes. Loss of innocence is an elephantine theme throughout the series (well, what did you expect with serial killing middle schoolers), and Minerva gives one of the best soliloquies I have ever heard in an anime on the subject. Love is a strong theme, and it really isn't that surprisingly when you put together that Yuno is a phoneticization of Juno. Revenge and retribution is thoroughly explored throughout the story, leading to some very interesting character developments. The expectations for a boyfriend/girlfriend are reinforced by the story, but they aren't challenged or analyzed very much at all, which causes it to detract more than it added (or that's just my opinion, take it or leave it). Lastly, Sight, as a concept, is all over the place. Each holder's future sight, the things that their diaries let them watch over, as well as the entire stories of Yukiteru, Apollo, Pluto, Dionysus, and to a degree Minerva, all involve interesting symbolism, metaphorical value, and commentary about sight and seeing. Yuki's ultimate dream is symbolized by a telescope for crying out loud, and don't get me started on the quote: \"Suffering always comes from the unseen world.\" I was very impressed by all of the themes throughout the anime. Considering its strong suit is shock value, I suppose it's fitting that the theme's were so surprisingly well done.\
Verdict:\
Out of 100 points, because factors of 10 are easiest for grading.\
Plot - The plot was required to make the show as thrilling and shocking as it is, but insofar as the writing itself, it's pretty weak. It defeats the purpose to have everything be god's little game. Character motives were generally drawn for the purpose of making the plot move along, and because so many characters were unrealistic, they weakened the structure of the story. The plot wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special, and the for the reason explained in the discussion above, it felt pretty contrived. 5 points.\
Characters - Whoa, the characters in this show. Literally every person is a crazy person in some way or another. If they aren't crazy, that just means they haven't broken yet. If you can suspend disbelief, their absurdity is actually lots of fun observe; however, if you ever have to do so, some of their depth is compromised. Most characters have good backstories, and everyone has a least a quirk or two to make them unique. However, some are more shallow and unfulfilled than I would've liked, and background characters tend to not make any sense at all. Still, the main cast is generally very interesting. I give it a 7 in character, with all positive attributes being interesting, and the main drawback being credibility.\
Emotional Investment - This series will get you emotionally invested enough. Yukiteru is a likable protagonist, though you'll have to forgive his wimpiness, and his motives are reconcilable. However, that's only the beginning, since there are many, many different characters that you'll end up empathizing with and feeling for, including almost every single diary holder. It's not the kind of show that's going to rip your heart out or anything, but it's at least fairly strong in this category. 7.\
Action - If it weren't contending with my previous review of Death Note this could easily be a 10. This show's action is so exhilarating that it's hard to compare to anything else. You'll be screaming on the inside multiple times an episode, and every time a certain diary holder touches an axe should make your blood freeze. Even in completely pacific scenes, spontaneous twists of circumstance keep the show exciting. But sometimes it really gets dragged down by fan-service and general silliness. The confrontations could've been made more epic, and some of the fights felt too easy. It's very strong in the action category, but it doesn't quite pass the bar of Death Note, so I give it a 9.\
Thought Provoking - It's not the kind of anime to make you ask the deeper questions, but it has its moments of insight. It's mentally scarring to a degree, and that's pretty thought provoking. There's not much to say without giving away major spoilers, so I'll give a 4 and leave it at that.\
Themes - There are very strong themes throughout the series, which is somewhat surprising, considering it's a thriller. Loss of innocence, love, sight, etc are discussed above, but there are many more present throughout. If you're curious, check it out for yourself. I give it a high score of 9.\
Emotional Direction - The amount of times I laughed out loud, yelped, cringed, tried not to scream and failed are tokens of how much emotional shock this anime presents. It has moments which are touching, creepy, and both at the same time. It can also be very depressing when it wants to be. If it were a little bit better written, this could've been a 10 category. However (and this is mostly due to the nature of a thriller) it felt pretty haphazard, and as a viewer I felt I was often being led to feel things just for the sake of feeling them. I'm going to give it an 8, mainly because of the looseness and almost randomness of its direction.\
Originality / Surprise Factor - The premise of a 12-team death match is not very original; however, the Psychic Hunger Games is at least something we haven't seen before. Some tropes and gags were imported from past anime. That being said, with all of the praise I've given the ability of this show to surprise you, it would just not be right to give it lower than a 9.\
Animation - The action scenes and gore are literally perfect. Many scenes had too much attention to fan-service, but other than that, they very well done. I think it could've benefitted from more detail at times, but it was overall pretty good. 8.\
Soundtrack - I had to go back to even notice it, but the background themes (and sounds) were used pretty well to build drama, hysteria, or intensity. While they're generally good, they're not outstanding, I don't feel like they're worth writing home about. On the other hand, both openings and endings were fantastic. The first opening theme has already become one of my favorites of all time. Of course, music is one of the categories most subject to opinion, so it's always to judge. I enjoyed a lot of music in the show, but it didn't stand out as amazing. I feel like I'm erring on the side of underselling it by giving a 7 - you might be like me and absolutely love it, or it might not suit your taste at all. \
That adds up to a cumulative score of 73. Always remember that I will be as critical as possible in my reviews, and keep in mind that 73 is not below average. (49 is below average.) Mirai Nikki has a lot of great things going for it, and so if you like to be surprised, you should check it out. If you are easily upset by R-rated images, err... I think there's a censored version. In any case, I hope this review was helpful for anyone deciding whether or not to take on the absurdly fun adventure in obscenity that is Mirai Nikki.\

    Ah yes , Mirai Nikki . The anime that makes people love Yandere. Pff , yeah right. \
The story is , or should I say , could be interesting and awesome . And it actually is that way in the beginning . But then it all goes downhill . Why ? We'll get there, when I'll talk about the enjoyment. The story gets a 7.5 --> 8 \
The art is good , nothing to complain about . But , I'm not an art expert.\
I can hardly remember the sound , so it wasn't anything spectacular . But it wasn't bad. \
Now ; the most important\
          \
        piece of an anime : The Characters. \
Yuki. Hate him . I'm serious . I just want to beat the crap outta him . I hope I'm allowed with words like that .... Anyways , I'm gonna spoil you just a tiny bit. He's whiny and a chicken (was going to use a different word) . Watch and see for yourself . There's no need to watch more than 3 episodes to get what I'm saying.\
Yuno. Ah yes , the so-called Yandere-queen. She's alright at first , but then she becomes too obsessive. And it got on my nerves .\
There are two characters I truly liked : Akise Aru and Uryuu Minene .\
I enjoyed this anime the first half . Then , it got too ...yandere (?) It was all about Yuno and whiny little Yuki , and of course , I can understand that because they're the main characters . But it felt like the anime focused more on the ''chemistry'' (which didn't really exist) between those two than the game .And when Yuki tries to be smart , it's like you get punched . It hurts hearing him trying to be smart , if you can understand what I'm saying. \
If the anime focused more on the game itself , it could have been so much better. But ... it didn't . \
This is one of those animes where you either love it , hate it , judge it , watched it and never thought about it again .  It depends on what kind of a person you are. Most guys , wouldn't really like this , because of Yuki , but they'd probably like Yuno . Girls would also like Yuno , not all of them of course. \
So , why don't you watch 10 episodes , and decide from there ? But if you want some real Yandere action , watch Elfen Lied. \
That's all for me . Hope you found my review helpful.\

    Okay let me just say without a doubt this is one of the better anime that i have seen so far and got me interested in the 'yandere' characters by introducing the queen of yandere Yuno  Gasai. the story starts off as the main character Yuki Amano getting a diary (which is his cell phone) that could tell him future events hints the name of the title being future diary, but what he doesn't know is that he is being put into one of the most dangerous games of his life. \
This Anime had its creepy moments( What's not creepy about a girl that\
          \
        stalks you) and gross moments( i will not say) the story is just one of those stories that you cant stop watching till the end.\

    Hi. This review is to just express how i feel about this anime. I have not much experience in anime and have not watched many but recently i like it. And maybe this might be still useful for someone. So here i go. Very little spoilers in this review.\
Story:7\
Story short is about a lonely boy who goes to school, no friends and his only friend is an imaginary god he thought he made up. This god is actually real and he is going to die by old age somehow so he puts a few participants including the boy into a death game, using this death\
          \
        game to choose the last man standing to be the new god to rule the world. So the show shows the process of this game where the participants need to kill each other but they do not know each other's identity at first.\
So they have to find the identity of the other participants and kill them in their daily lifes. Setting is in the normal world.\
Main characters is the lonely boy, a girl in his class who is super extremely obsessed with him. She is kinda of mentally unbalanced at times who helps him in this battle.\
But there is more to the plot then just this.\
Story Quite DARK, with some romance on main characters. some action during the death game, captain obvious. Fast paced at first which i thought was good but then it became a little slower, still interesting. There were a few mysteries and plot twists which made the show interesting. Show was not all action, but when there is, it is kinda cool. A bit of humor. Only a bit i emphasize, maybe to not make the show too dark.\
Art:10\
It looked great. And i don't mind it, so 10. Its kind of new that's why.\
Sound 10:\
Good Opening. Sometimes nice OSTs, suits well for a thriller-kind of anime. \
Character:8\
Side characters are not developed well unfortunately but likable. Cause most of the showtime does not focus on the characters except for the female lead and male lead with Flashbacks and background stories.Male lead has some character development on how he is going to be braver and stuff like that which is good. I like yuno(female lead)'s behavior cause she is kind of crazy and it is very different from other anime girls. So kind of amused by it so it is a plus point. Most Characters are likable and some are so crazy and amusing. \
Enjoyment:9\
I thought i would not like animes that are too dark. Cause it makes you sad but i was wrong. \
Mirai Nikki is awesome and kind of scary for me sometimes in a sense of the characters' behaviors. Very weird behavior but amusing. It is a interesting show to watch.\
Overall: 9! I like it!\
however, some parts are quite unbelievable for some. In a sense, unexpectedly absurd.\

I can never figure out where creators have such great imagination. This is the first review I've written, so I'm going to keep this short.\
Mirai Nikki is very interesting with the twist of Thriller and Horror. It really made me sit on the edge of my seat at times because it was THAT interesting. It's funny, kind of thrilling and scary, and totally leaves cliffhangers everywhere. I loved this anime.\
I recommend this to anyone who likes Comedy, Horror, Thriller and Sci-Fi. This was a great anime overall.  \

    Mirai Nikki - Future Diary - is an anime with a deep plot. If you like story line's that are confusing and complicated then you'll love MN. It is twisted and insane in the most perfect way. \
If you are light-hearted, like me, you should think before watching, for it is cut-throat and no BS. The characters go all out with nothing to spare. It is extremely bloody, but not too graphic. Some parts are down right disturbing, but hey, it is what it is. \
The plot will leave you emotionally and mentally satisfied, for this anime is AMAZING!!\

    I saw a lot of very positive reviews about this anime, and I absolutely adore anime that are survival-based, so I was excited to watch this. However, after watching a few episodes, I found myself bored and annoyed with Yukiteru's attitude towards, well, everything. His innocence and clinging to one small, small hope got old, especially after all of the stuff he went through. However, I was convinced that it would get better, so I watched on.\
I do not find myself bothered by much, especially not gore. But there were (trigger warning) rape (and almost rape) scenes that I, myself, thought were completely unnecessary. I\
          \
        generally like anime with rape scenes a significant amount less than I do ones without them, and this was no exception to the rule. I cringed and skipped through that episode, but read a summary of it so I wouldn't be entirely too confused about what was going on.\
I thought the art was nice. Everything was well-drawn and well-animated. The characters had varying skin tones, personalities, though they all had the same, basic body type. One thing I enjoyed was how each character that died, early on or not, had their own unique backstory that was explained in relative depth, instead of them being random enemies. All of them lead their own different lives, had different styles of dress, hair, personality, and all died in a relatively different way. Some were harder to kill than others.\
There were strong female roles, and that was nice. Gasai Yuno is said to be the queen of yandere. She and Murumuru were my favorite characters. Would definitely consider cosplaying.\
The anime overall was average. It wasn't amazing but it wasn't horrifying. It was a decent watch, if you didn't try to go through more than six or so episodes at once, but some of it was still.. Iffy.\
I probably won't rewatch it. \

    This is my first review that i make on this web site so dont get  angry with me :b\
So this is my first thriller anime that contains on thing that i love: Survival ability.\
Lets start from the begining:\
I indentify Yuki as a guy almoust like me, in some situations i like to be the spectator not the actor. i dont write a diary but sometimes i write somethings just for relax my mind about my life but returnin to the sory : \
Yuki is a studant that doenst go along very weel with his classmates, he preffers to be the spectator in everyones life\
          \
        instead of being the actor, so he writes is day in her cellphone, like a diary, and when he gets home he \"dives in his imaginary world\" there he meets Deus - ex machina the god of time and space.\
But then theres Yuno. A beutifull pink haired girl that secretly is obecessed with Yuki and at the same time loves him.\
My personall opinion about this anime is that, in the end we can figure all things out about this love story, why i say this?\
We see during all the anime or manga, that Yuno is capable of killing anyone that wants to hurt Yuki our lie about Yuno's will with Yuki.\
It shows in the beggining a huge obcession of Yuno for Yuki wich ends in a killing spree for Yukis protection.\
When Yuki's mother and father dies, Yuki starts to relie more on Yuno's skills to win the game and bring back her parents to life( a lie that Yuno said to Yuki, its impossible even for God) \
So Yuno and Yuki starts to chase donw all the other players of this game, to bring and end to it and revive his parents.\
But during that Akise tells to Yuki that there was another Yuno ins his house and the living Yuno was fake. Wen akise realizes (after visiting Deus) that the fake Yuno is the first created world Yuno he wants to tell it straith away to Yuki beause Yuno's intention is to kill Yuki and start a new game in another world. That truth bring's Yuki's will to revive is parents even stronger because he realy belives that can bring them back to life so he kills Hinata, Kuosuke, Mao and the 8º. Yunos kill Akise for his onw sake for not letting Yuki know the real truth \
In the end (for take the review a little short) Yuki and Yuno be like a couple both knowing that one of them has to die. Yuki knew for akise that she wanted to kill him gets a litle unconfortable with the situation and gets Yuno angried after that Yuki belived in Akise version and  starts to fight Yunos despite Yuno already donest care for Yuki's safe now. Murumuru makes Yuno God and gives them powers to start building a new world.\
 But after Yuno's tries to lock Yuki in a imaginary world with the not existence of Yunos soul our name there. Yuki's love destrois the imaginary world and stops the 1º Yuno to kill the 3º world Yuno. \
Yuki confess is true love for Yuno and wants to die for her just to let her know before diying that he loved Yuno more that anithing.\
But Yunos stab herself and says that he his uncapable of killing Yuki because she loves him and she was all the time willing to die for him.\
My personall opinio is that this thriller anime in the end shows a beutefull love story. prof to that is  Yuno killing himself wen she had the chance to do the game and Yuki's love all over again, i just loved that finish.\
What i dindt liked: Yuno was all the time saying : Yukiiii with a irritating voice that made me some headache xD\
I loved the anime in a general way to the completely crazy and obcessed Yuno to the sweet and lovely girl that she turned out to be in the end.\
P.S in the OVA we see the true form of Yukis loves for Yuno. He wasant capable of building a new world without her, he only do that wen Yunos dies and meets him in the third unbuild world.\

    The story is alright i guess about a game and they have to try to kill everyone who has a future diary and the last one standing becomes god\
The sound was nice. It was scary and all and did the scary effects nicely\
However, the main character is pathetic and the girl is more strong than the guy is which makes the characters not that good. None of the characters were good and the girl is really crazy and mental and it's hard to follow. \
I enjoyed it a little i guess and for overall i'll give it around a 7 because there was a lot\
          \
        of bad parts and only some good parts.\
If you love blood and gore you should give this anime a try\

    This will be my first review on this site and I've been here for two years... anyways, where to begin. I was drawn to this anime by a Yuno Gasai page on Facebook. I was interested in some of the screen caps but had no clue what the anime was about so I decided to check it out and I have got to say, I was pleasantly surprised. I like to consider myself something of an anime critic, I haven't seen an absurd amount of anime but I definitely know a good one when I see it and Mirai Nikki is DEFINITELY an outstanding anime.\
          \
\
Story: 10/10\
This is where Mirai Nikki truly shines. Unlike many anime that follow the same formula, given the genre, this one really stands out through all 26 episodes. I didn't find myself growing bored at all throughout the entirety of the series (I finished it in one day). For nearly 10 1/2 hours straight, I sat down and watched as the story unfolded before me. The plot within this anime is definitely unique and extremely captivating. The fact that you NEED to come back to have your questions answered was very interesting for me. The future is constantly changing within this anime and with the story taking so many unexpected turns, I loved every minute of it. I'm normally not a fan of dark anime but this series definitely changed that. \
Art: 8/10\
I'm not too sure what to say about the art. While it was the art that caught my attention in the first place, the story is what kept me interested. Throughout the series there are a few minor dips in quality but overall it was relatively high.\
Sound: 9/10\
The first opening and ending had me hooked. They're catchy and very representative of the dark tone present within the central plot. \
Character: 10/10\
If only two qualities determined how great the anime truly is, it'd be the story and characters. The characters all have plenty of depth (save one or two) and all have their own unique roles to play. Following an arc type progression, each of the Future Diary holders has (at least) 2 episodes devoted to them, allowing ample time to provide complexity to each character. \
Enjoyment: 10/10\
I definitely found Mirai Nikki very similar to a book. It had me going through the episodes the same way I would go through a book. For almost 10 1/2 hours straight, I couldn't stop watching. The story's gripping premise, the excitement of the well paced action, the feelings of despair felt by the main character. The feeling of immersion set by this anime is truly amazing.\
Overall: 10/10\
I rarely give an anime a 10. The one's that I do give 10's stick out in a big way, whether they have a serious emotional impact, an incredible story, or just an astounding sense of immersion, they stick out. Mirai Nikki did just that; it stuck out and as such, I would highly recommend this anime to anyone.\

Perfect for people that crave a anime with a high paced and alot of action but also with happy romantic parts in it as well as a yandere character(Yuno) which is also a must have.\
 it is perfect for many viewers due to the blend of killing and blood in it as well as the romantic aspects between Yuno and Yuki, who at first uses Yuno to stay alive but later realizes that he truly cant live without her.

    I saw this line to describe mirai nikki on Facebook and I couldn't say it better myself \"dysfunctional couple participates in the hunger games\". There are people who like this and there are people who hate this but any way it is it's an anime you don't forget all that easily (even if you want to). Oh and there may be a few spoilers ahead!\
Story: the story was good. It was fun and entertaining (when I say fun I definitely do NOT mean funny 'cause it wasn't), not for light-hearted people but good for ones that are just a little dark and do not mind\
          \
        a LOT of death in their anime (I include myself in that category). It has flaws in the storyline but overall it is enjoyable and definitely not your usual romance anime, so do not expect the main female to be a weak and cute girl that crushes over her senpai if you want that then you are at the wrong side of mal. -8\
Art and sound: Art was good, nothing unique, nothing bad, just good. Sound was  ok in the dubbing but the males voice in the original was one of the most annoying male voices I've heard in anime so I suggest you watch it dubbed.\
Character: here is a bit of spoil so you might not want to read this part.... yuno was great a yandere for other yanderes to admire honestly she was fun in a disturbing way. I also really liked the other players. Yuki on the other hand was plainly annoying but the ones I found even more useless than him were his friends, the show would have been much better if they weren't in it! -6 \
Overall it was a good anime just not good for everyone, if you don't mind characters that are a little (or a lot) twisted than it's ok, but if you do than don't watch it!\

    (Spoiler-free) \"Maybe the future is bad. But there's a future beyond that, right?\"\
- Story: 3/10\
Well, all I can say is that the original potential of this anime is one of the only good points of its story. Battle Royale-style types of anime aren't that uncommon, but this one had a special twist that made it stand out: the future diaries. Twelve diary users are selected by Deus Ex Machina, God of the universe, to fight in a survival game to determine his successor. Using their own diaries, they can see into the future (albeit not without limits) and use this knowledge to either try and\
          \
        survive or hunt down their fellow competitors. Makes for a promising story, right? \
... Well, it does. But that's not what we get. \
My main problem with Mirai Nikki is that it's too focused on dropping \"OH SHIT\" moments on the viewer, rather than actually trying to develop its characters. If you are somewhat squeamish with blood and gore, I do not recommend this anime to you UNLESS you go out of your way to watch the censored version. However, the censored version still has a good amount of blood in it, but without as much gore and brief nudity. Yes, this anime has that, too. Also, there are rape and suicide triggers, so be careful with that. \
 Going back to the whole thing with the show trying to pull the rug out from under you ALL THE TIME, it gets annoying but it also makes the show fun to watch. After I got past my initial annoyance, I went into the next episodes thinking, \"Lol I wonder what shit's gonna go down this time.\" This is what made Mirai Nikki entertaining for me, and what made me keep wanting to watch it. Admittedly, near the end they drop a crap ton of mindfuck bombs on us that make the story take a 180 and next to nothing makes any coherent sense anymore. Characters are able to do stuff that they shouldn't be able to do just because it looks cool and badass and whatnot. \
And then there's the ending.\
I won't spoil anything about the ending since this review is spoiler-free, but all I'll say is this: It did tie up some loose ends and gave a sense of closure, but it was incredibly anticlimactic. They later try to resolve this with the OVA, Redial, which I feel gives a better ending to story but is still ridiculous in itself. \
Overall, the story had great potential, but fell short because of three reasons: 1) the characters, which I will go into later, 2) the focus being on pulling the rug out from under the viewers, rather than creating a consistent and meaningful story and developing the characters, and 3) using shock value as a means to make the actions of a character stand out WAY TOO MUCH. \
-Art: 5/10 \
The art style is meh, I honestly just don't like the way their noses look. Other than that, though, it gets the job done and actually depicts the blood and gore well. It's fairly consistent, although there are some derpy shots at times. Some of the effects were cheesy and made me cringe. Character design was fine, everyone was distinctive and their outfits and whatnot fit their personalities. \
The first opening is gold both visually and audio-wise, although I'll only mention the visual of it here. The opening is pretty much just black and white with only red highlighted, accenting the blood and the red sky depicted, which helps give the creepy and psycho feel of the show. It's great. If you decide not to watch the show, at least watch the opening. \
The first ending is pretty good. Visually, it's pretty simple with the diary users just fading from their scenes and showing a few other shots of of Yuki, Yuno, and Akise, but it fits the mood of the show. The first 16 seconds is my favorite part, personally. \
The second opening isn't as good as the first, and instead of highlighting red, everything has a blue tone. It also reuses some of the animations of Yuno from the first opening, but they don't seem to fit as well. Everything else is meh.\
The second ending is nothing special. It's literally just a bunch of shots of Yuno. \
- Sound: 7/10\
I actually like the Mirai Nikki OST. The BGM ranges from happy and calm to creepy and dark. It's not noteworthy or epic, but none of the music sounds out of place and gets the job done. The sound effects were good and didn't sound too unrealistic. \
Onto the seiyuus/voice actors. The seiyuus in Mirai Nikki did a good job, namely Yuno's. I doubt any English voice actor can do Yuno's voice as it was done in the Japanese version. This is one of the main reasons that a lot of people hate the dub. Yuno's high-pitched, creepy, and at times psycho-sounding voice wasn't present in the English dub. I've also heard the argument that Brina Palencia (Yuno's English VA) makes Yuno sound a lot older than she actually is and doesn't make her sound like a total psycho bitch. I agree in the sense that the Japanese voice of Yuno is better because it makes her sound like a creepy little girl, but I also believe that her English voice actor is not as shitty as everyone says. Like I said earlier, I doubt there are very many VAs who can pull off doing a voice exactly like Yuno's Japanese voice comfortably for twenty episodes on end. Most high-pitched female voices in anime are used to make the character sound cute, not creepy. A lot of English VAs can pull off the cute, but not the creepy. The solution? Drop the pitch but keep the creepy vibe. Did Brina Palencia do that? Yes, but not well enough. Her voice just isn't suited for it. This is the fault of the casting. \
Anyways, the dub itself was meh. The script was cheesy at times and made the story sound a lot more dramatic than it actually was. The voice actors did a decent job, but it's more a problem of casting. Like I stated before, Brina Palencia's voice just wasn't suited for a character like Yuno. I had the same problem with Yuki's English VA. He did a great job, but like with Yuno's VA, his voice made him sound like an older teenager (16-18) even though he's actually 14. I don't recommend the dub unless you're too lazy to read subtitles and don't mind the older-sounding voices. \
The only reason I'm giving sound a 7 is because of the first opening (and ending, but mainly the opening). If you have never seen it, GO WATCH IT. The music is epic and the visuals compliment it excellently. It's easily one of the best anime openings I've ever seen. \
The first ending is also catchy and sets the mood well, but isn't as epic as the opening. I still like it, though.\
The second opening and second ending are passable, but I prefer the first opening and ending far more. The second opening is sung in Engrish, but I honestly couldn't tell at first until I saw a version with subtitles. The second ending is meh. \
- Characters: 2/10\
Ugh. Given better characters, this could have been a great story. The two main characters, Yuki and Yuno, would have worked as characters if they weren't the MAIN leads. If they were just some random side characters, or even diary users with a minor role, them being in the story would be acceptable. Unfortunately though, they were placed in the main character slot, meaning we see the story through their perspective (mainly through Yuki's, though). \
Starting off with Yukiteru Amano, aka Yuki, he's an average 14 year old, but has no friends. As a result, he spends all his time on his phone (not unlike most teenagers nowadays). Not too bad of a character background, but my main problem with him is that he's a total wuss and can't get anything done himself. Seventh, aka Marco Ikusaba, another diary user, even calls him out for this in the show, which means the script writers intentionally made him to be a scared little kid who can't do anything without Yuno, who acts as his plot armor. This changes later near the end of the show, but not in a pleasant way. \
Now, onto the Yandere Goddess of anime herself, Yuno Gasai. At first we see her as a popular, smart, pretty, and sweet girl who has a slightly obsessive crush on Yuki. As the story progresses, however, she switches between this personality and the crazy yandere stalker who is completely obsessed with Yuki and basically forces him into a relationship. When people \"threaten her man\" in any way or try to hurt him, she goes psycho bitch on them and kills them. Literally. Also, whenever any female interacts with Yuki in any way, it becomes Yuno's new task to kill her. Honestly, about 90% of the blood spilled in the whole show is because of Yuno. And that's saying a lot. \
Now, the \"romance\" between the two is once of the focal points of the show, and... I'm kind of hesitant to even call it \"romance\". Yuno's obviously infatuated with Yuki to the point where she feels like her life would be nothing without him. To this end, she protects Yuki from the other diary users in order to keep him from dying. Her diary is literally called the \"Yukiteru Diary\" (or the \"Diary of Future Love\", as she likes to call it), and she gets to see entries about his future in ten-minute intervals. Now, when I said she protects Yuki from the other diary users, it makes her sound like a good girlfriend, right? I mean, who doesn't want a girlfriend/boyfriend who'll protect you when your life's in danger? While it's true that Yuno does protect Yuki, she also goes a little... Extra. A lot extra, actually. A girl invited Yuki to hang out after school? SLICE THE WHORE'S NECK OPEN. After visiting Yuki's house, she said she was glad Yuki's mom took their \"relationship\" well, because if she didn't, things would have \"gotten ugly\". I know it's a common trope for a girl to have a bad relationship with her mother-in-law, but killing your boyfriend's mom because she doesn't approve of your relationship with him? And that's just scratching the surface of her yandere-ness. \
Now, Yuki knows that Yuno's a psycho mass-murdering yandere. Why does he keep her around? Because he knows that without her, another diary user's gonna come and take him out. He doesn't want to die. But he doesn't want to fight, either. He's reluctant to get his hands dirty. So he lets Yuno take care of that. Their relationship is give-and-take. \"Alright, if you protect me, I'll let you hang around me and you'll get the occasional kiss.\" Yuno knows he's just using her, too, but she doesn't care; as long as she gets to be with him, it doesn't matter. The only time they actually start to act like a real couple is near the end, but then SHIT GOES DOWN and the rest is spoiler territory. Their relationship is like trying to make a smoothie by putting rocks in a blender along with some fruit and ice cream and expecting something good to come out of it. You can try to sweeten up their relationship with the occasional kiss and cheesy lines, but it doesn't change the fact that their \"romance\" is a huge mess. \
It should go without saying that they do some things that fourteen year olds shouldn't be doing. In other words, everything they do in the whole show. \
The minor characters aren't as bad as Yuki and Yuno. Some of them I actually liked. But they don't make the story better than it actually was. If anything, they're just plot devices used to try and develop Yuki and Yuno's relationship. This wouldn't be a problem IF YUKI AND YUNO ACTUALLY DEVELOPED AS CHARACTERS. Develop the characters well, and their relationship will develop too. Mirai Nikki does the opposite and tries to develop their relationship without actually developing the characters themselves. This is the the primary reason that Mirai Nikki failed story-wise.\
- Enjoyment: 7/10\
I gave a pretty negative review, so why am I saying I enjoyed it? Because even though it sucks as a show, it's still fun to watch, and that's the whole reason I watch anime. If you like watching anime to watch brilliant masterpieces with wonderful characters and interesting and developed storylines, you are most certainly going to hate this anime and should stay away. But if you like watching anime for sheer entertainment value, Mirai Nikki might be worth a watch, if you don't mind blood, gore, and brief nudity (although it is toned down in the censored version). It does a good job of keeping you in suspense and keeping you on the edge of your seat, though the story falls flat on its face because of its disappointingly flat characters  and its ending is lackluster, to say the least. \

    When the show first premiere, it was hyped for the anticipation and some horror it provided. In fact I believed that too since the opening was a bit creepy.\
Turns out it wasn't like that since everyone who wanted to kill each other were more or so people who were unsatisfied with their lives. As a whole, I felt the story was decent for the most part. Most people would be very disappointing with the protagonist since even at a point of danger, he is unwilling to do something out of his moral boundaries and even the person who he wants to avoid, he constantly uses\
          \
        her as protection. Having dealt with Shinji from \"Neon Genesis\", I was a bit sympathetic to why he behave that way. \
What I was very disappointed at what the ending and lack of explanation for why the whole killing game started. Questions I had throughout the series included by did God need a successor, wasn't he already immortal if he was God? Why take a suggestion from one of the creators of a phone diary, in which long term could bring about a lot of flaws? Those questions persisted and in the end, what I got was a somewhat cheesy ending, in which didn't affair to make the story flow. In a sense, it was sort of deus ex machina as a friend of mine would say. \
Since I have mix feeling about this anime through to the pros and cons of its storytelling, I would not recommend this to people who have watched a lot of anime. Your discretion is advised.\

    As a show on it's own, Mirai Nikki is a extremely entertaining show. But i can understand why people thing otherwise. Nothing is perfect, and we have to understand that. So i will point out the good and the bad. But first let me just get some details out of the way,\
The story is extremely simple, there is a competition (created by god or deus) with 12 people. These individuals gain the ability to see the future using their cellphone. If the phone or person gets killed she/or she is out of the game. The winner becomes god.\
Among those 12 people the story follows the\
          \
        footsteps of Amano Yukiteru, a lonely grade schooler with no one to turn too. Lucky for him one of the members of the competition is madly in love with him and is willing to do anything for him, her name is Yuno, a pink haired innocent girl on the outside but a insane killing machine on the inside.\
As a character i absolutely adore Yuno. It's nice to see how someone who bears the stereotypical female norms of society can become so twisted yet change to innocence in seconds. I love characters like this, they are the most interesting to watch.\
The sound and art is up to par. I found that the expressionism the character were slight different in this show compared to other anime. Mirai Nikki bears some wonderful art and sound.\
There are a lot of characters in this show. So there wasn't much room to generate some character development with everyone. But they did enough to tell what kind of person they are and stuff so it's not bland or anything. This show does have some memorable characters so don't fret about that. Many people complain that the characters are either really dumb or they change personality instantly constantly like Yukiteru. Yes Yukiteru is a EXTREMELY dynamic character no doubt about it. It could be a be a bad thing for some people but i kind of like it considering that the kid doesn't know what he wants.\
Now the problem that quite a few people have with this show is that the producers implemented elements from other genres to the show. And yes I agree to a certain extent that this sours the show. But in my opinion, it's really not that bad. To be honest it could have ended up much worse.\
\
Overall, this show is not perfect (no anime is) but it is extremely entertaining and worth a watch.\

    Very polarizing anime, and it's not hard to see why. Mirai Nikki is an anime suffering from genre identity crisis, poorly written periphery characters, and a plethora of plotholes. That tends to lead people to hate it....... Except for the people who are so completely wooed by the show's legendary female lead that they're willing to disregard the series' problems.\
\
Where do I stand? Well somewhere in the middle. I think that, by and large, Mirai Nikki had vast potential that it squandered horribly. The anime is guilty of careless attention to detail, time and time again. But I can't bring myself to rate it as\
          \
        terrible because I know I'd be lying if I said there weren't times I got exceptionally invested........ Let's try a detailed breakdown. \
Story: 4/10\
For starters, it's just.... so full of plot holes guys. Not to mention the pacing problem: Mirai Nikki's arcs mostly last about two episodes usually. In other words, the antagonists are dispelled shortly after being introduced. As a result character development is practically nonexistent, and the suspenseful setups we get are typically resolved in disappointing ways that are often the worst possible combination of boring and prepesterous.\
In general, things are left unexplained, and NOT in a fun ambiguous way, but rather a \"Wow, this writing is lazy as fuck\" way. So much about virtually every major event in this series simply doesn't make any sense at all. Police are exceptionally incompetent, character motives turn on dimes without explanation, settings aren't handled with care..... It's a freaking mess. \
It's also worth pointing out that the OVA is, for whatever reason, actually a vital part of the story (and was the actual ending to the manga). While I personally like the OVA's ending (one of the story's few redeeming qualities), I'm unclear as to why it wasn't simply included in the final episode.\
In summary, what saves the story from being a total disaster is a well-executed endgame. It's just too bad that this does nothing to keep you from shaking your head at the finer details of the show, especially in the beginning as a first time viewer. Mirai Nikki simply didn't seem to care much about details, and it's noticeable and bothersome.\
\
Art: 7/10\
Mirai Nikki is mostly well-drawn and well-animated. Nothing is groundbreaking, and a few characters look odd, but the styling is consistent and at no point a real liability in any way. \
Sound: 6/10\
Meh. Some of the effects are odd, but my main issue is the music. While the piano tones can be effectively haunting, they're a bit overdone, and some pieces are just straight up cheesy. Furthermore the second opening and second endings both come off as being very lazily done. Still, there's no glaring awfulness I suppose\
Character: 6.5/10\
Yuno Gasai brings this score up significantly by being a near 10 herself. I will say that [slight spoiler in the remainder of this sentence] her character gets in my opinion a bit cheapened at the end of the story by some weird revelations, but she's still exceptionally fun to watch and shockingly lovable for such a dark individual. \
What's absurd to me, then, is how the same writer who put so much care into writing Yuno Gasai could be so UTTERLY CARELESS when writing just about everyone else. \
Our male protagonist, Yukki, is often horribly inconsistent. He will inexplicably make 90, 180, or even fucking 360 degree turns at random. It's bizarre and makes him hard to empathize with. How are we supposed to get behind a character whose motives we really just don't understand? Granted he comes around and is somewhat charismatic at the end, but it's not enough to forget how bothersome he was before. Much like with the story, Yukki is well-done in terms of the \"big picture\" but just so awfully done in the little details that it's hard to ignore. \
Most other characters are flat as pancakes and only half as interesting. Occasionally we run into some fairly interesting folks, but the thing is that these type of characters are still only 7s at best, and for every one of them is three 2's screwing everything up.\
In summary, if not for Yuno, I would have given this a character score of 3/10.\
Enjoyment: 7/10\
For a long time I was willing to mostly look past all of the plot silliness and character issues because I got invested in a more simple aspect of the show that was mostly handled with great care [SPOILER AHEAD]: the romance. I watched because I wanted to see what happened between Yuno and Yukki and I felt I would have a strong reaction. But the ending really only left me scratching my head in a bit of confusion. I'm not sure how I feel, and to me that's not good in the world of entertainment. Still, I'd be lying if I said I didn't have fun watching Yuno go apeshit throughout most of this. But for every Yuno-is-awesome moment, there was a moment of Yukki godawfulness or annoyance at details that honestly I can't say didn't screw with my enjoyment a bit. \
\
Overall: 6/10\
Is Mirai Nikki worth your time? Well, that depends: what are you expecting? If your'e expecting an all-around solid show that handles plot, characters, and everything else with care and attention to detail, you'll be massively disappointed. Mirai Nikki, simply put, is not a show which pays careful attention to detail. Plot holes dominate, and so much is left unexplored, unexplained, or simply unjustified. \
But if you're looking at this show primarily because you want to see what all the Yuno Gasai fuss is all about? Well then maybe you'll find that it is, in some way, worth your time. I'd be lying if I said Yuno Gasai hasn't earned her place as one of my all-time favorite characters........ She could've been done better, imo, but so much of her is done so well. \
My guess as to why this anime tends to attract a slew of both strongly negative and stronglypositive reviews is that, essentially, its viewers can be divided into two groups: Those who felt Yuno Gasai lived up to the hype and those who either didn't or didn't think it was enough.\
If you DO decide to watch this, be sure to catch the OVA after you're finished. To not watch it is to not get the answers to the questions you'll have.\

    Well I believe I was generous rating this anime a 6. When I started watching it last year there was quite a bit of hype surrounding it. \
Well I guess the start was good with an original concept. Every phone user thing had there own little power if you will. There was quite a good depth on the characters with there one parts and full episodes showing their origins.\
Later in the anime I felt like the writer/team had ran out of ideas as the plot began to diverse from making sense. I seemed that the anime became more sexualized of lots of blood to cover\
          \
        for the similarities of each episode. \
Every character you met in the later episodes felt they had the same back story and same personalities. I was also very disappointed with the ending as if the team had just gave up.\
Wouldn't recommend this anime. Might as well go watch Tokyo Ghoul instead \

    There are a lot of “high stakes game” anime out there that really aren’t that high stakes, nor contain the kind of drama I’d expect of something executing the genre. I’m looking at you Eden of the East. And while I have had a few run ins with series with great ideas for these games, but terrible execution, Mirai Nikki has broken that trend and given me both an interesting plot, as well as a good execution of said plot. That’s not to say that Mirai Nikki is not without its faults, for it does inevitably have many areas where it falls short.\
Mirai Nikki translates\
          \
        to Future Diary, which is what is given to twelve contestants in a game to win the seat of God. All twelve of the participants of this game are given various forms of diaries (whether they be scrolls, a sketch book, or cell phones) which tell them different things about what will happen in the future. For instance, our hero, Bitch Boy…I MEAN YUKITERU AMANO, has a diary that tells him about his surroundings. Meanwhile, his stalker, Gasai Yuno, has a diary that tells her all about what Yuki is doing. The different holders of the diaries are made by God, named Deus, to fight for his position in the universe as he is dying. Why did he pick twelve random people to fight to take the place of God instead of find a worthy candidate through an application process or something like that, who knows. But for the purposes of not going into too much nitpicking, let’s just go along with this.\
From the start, our heroes (or hero(or anti-hero(this show gives us a cast of very gray characters))) are made to fight some strange characters, including a teacher who kills on the street, a terrorist who has a seemingly infinite number of explosives at her disposal, a cult leader, an insane super-hero, and a guy who has turned his dogs into mechanical monsters. All the while, Yuki and Gasai are establishing one of the strangest relationships you’ll ever see, as well as forming alliances, breaking alliances, and generally going insane with the fact they can trust no one.\
What makes the execution of this show good compared to shows like Eden of the East or Deadman Wonderland is that it creates a game, and it sticks with the game. It never goes off into side-crap and there’s never a point where everyone comes together and battles the big bad guy so that nobody has to die and everyone is happy. While the show does have a happy ending, the ending is attained through a lot of good ol’ fashioned violence, insanity, and gore. The gore is so bad that it has to be blocked out on Japanese TV. That’s not to say this is in any way competition for Tokyo Gore Police or any horror movie along those lines; the gore may be a little too much for some, but for me was just the right balance, never too disgusting, never too friendly.\
Another reason the execution is good is the psychological aspect that is played out throughout the show. This is especially prevalent in an episode concerning Yuki choosing his friends or Gasai. These moments are tense, dramatic, and slow; they play up the drama just enough, but never overdo it. They leave you at the edge of your seat, queuing up the next episode despite the fact it is well past your bedtime. This show has a real sense of drama about it, and it is character driven, but it’s also the basic psychological aspects of putting a bunch of people into a fight for their life. While much of the drama is forced, I must at least commend the portion spoken of before and a couple of points throughout where I did want to keep watching to see what would happen.\
One of the major factors to this show is that none of the characters are infallible. Every character has issues and problems that come up to either bite them or help them, and the fact that every character, even the bad guys, are given at least a tiny smidgen of exposition and backstory really helps us care more about them. And I know this is not true of the first bad guy we encounter, he was more for story exposition. Future characters are all given some time so you can figure out whether you like them or not. Of course, there are many unlikeable characters to be found (I.E most of them), but the fact that these characters are given a bit of backstory and humanity really helps Mirai Nikki not be totally unbearable.\
Our main character, Yuki, is a huge pussy. He’s a bitch who cries at the slightest inclination. It’s not fun to watch. There are some points, toward the end especially, where he does get bearable, but half the time you wish he’d just die so we didn’t have to deal with the torrent of tears that comes with every death, toe stub, toilet, and revelation.\
I much prefer Gasai Yuno, who I would like to consider the main character. She gets enough screen time and attention to be the main character. She’s a creepy stalker at first, then she’s an insane creepy stalker, but she slowly grows on you if only because she is the complete opposite of Yuki and provides some insane bloodshed, rather than some little bitch baby tears. That’s probably the only reason I liked her was the respite I was given from dealing with Yuki.\
Minene Uryuu was my favorite character. While Gasai is a badass, I thought Minene was even better. From the first time seeing her blow up half a fucking middle school, I knew she was going to be amazing. As the series progresses she lightens up a little and takes on a certain humanity that is both touching and well executed, but watching her go insane and hearing her scream is pleasant. She’s a no nonsense kind of girl, kind of like Gasai. But more badass. Because she has an eyepatch.\
Let’s talk about the ending, which is truly where the show loses itself and becomes a bit sloppy. Now, people have complained about everything about this show from the poor art to the poor direction. I didn’t really give a damn about either, because I was just here to see people get the shit beat out of them. What I have a problem with is the overly complex and almost Madoka-like ending. What is up with time travel in anime recently? A second world and a third world? It wasn’t exactly confusing as much as an excuse to create a happy ending. And while I love a happy ending, I’d have been perfectly happy if Mirai Nikki didn’t attempt to be smarter than it was and instead ended the tournament, explained Gasai’s intentions, created the infinite loop that was sure to come, and then ended it there. I didn’t need to have the Dragon Ball Z style fighting between Murmur and Minene…that kind of killed her character for me (I preferred the explosive part of her, not the panty shot flying part).\
And on top of that, the ending…is weird. Not weird because it is strange, it’s weird because it ends five pages before the manga does. Instead of just showing Gasai and Yuki living happily ever after, it teases this, then ends. YOU COULDN’T FIT THE LAST FIVE PAGES OF THE MANGA IN? SERIOUSLY?\
Mirai Nikki is bound to get a lot of shit, but as far as entertainment goes, it’s got that in the bag. The plot could be considered stupid by some, but I thought it was decent enough. The characters can be considered bad by some, and I can see that. Yuki is a horrible main character and Gasai, while a badass, is very inconsistent in character. This could be attributed to her insanity, but I like to attribute it to bad writing. That goes double for the romance, which seems to develop out of nowhere. Yuki pretends through most of the series, yet  suddenly falls for Gasai? For no reason? He even asks why he fell for her at one point and doesn’t come up with a clear enough answer to give me any sort of warm feeling. And of course, the ending becomes something huge and painfully broken. If it had ended with a bad ending where everyone dies and Gasai keeps replaying the past over and over, it would have left a better taste in my mouth than the ending I was given.\
It’s not amazing, but, at least for me, I found myself really enjoying a lot of it. I’m a sucker for dumb violence and gore, and Mirai Nikki provides in that respect. In the respect of good characters and ingenuity, it doesn’t have much…other than Minene.\

    I think almost everyone heard for anime series called Mirai Nikki.This anime is quite popular amongst fans,so I'll write my opinion.\
My review won't be really long and I won't write so much about content from the series,I just want to make it as short as I can because I don't want to repeat what's said in description of the anime.\
Story: 7 \
I think story is good.When I first watched this,I was actually really interested and I couldn't take my eyes off of my computer.Anime has a lot of flaws, but pllot is actually good, so if anything, watch it for the plot.\
Art: 7 \
Art is\
          \
        okay,it's a little older but characters have good design and overall it's okay, I am not really impressed but I don't have anything to complain about, so I'll just say it's good.\
Sound: 6\
I didn't really pay atention to sound, it didn't left any impression on me so I'm giving it fair six.\
Characters: 3\
I think characters are the main problem of this series.I don't know if people agree with me or not, but personally I didn't like characters at all.I'll write my opinion about few characters who are the most important.\
Yukiteru Amano: Well, for main character, he is pretty useless and I didn't find him interesting at all.I don't even understand who Yuno fell in love with him, he is clumsy, his personality is boring etc.I don't need to write more about him, he is pretty annoying guy.\
Yuno Gasai: And here we go in discussion about yandere queen(if you don't know what yandere is google it,I'm too lazy to write it here,but I guess everyone know what yandere means).I personally don't like yandere characters so much, but I usually can stand them.In case of Mirai Nikki, I really couldn't stand Yuno.Yeah, she is badass, she can kill, she can fight, but her obsession with Yukiteru is so freaking annoying.I know that's a part of being yandere, but I really couldn't stand this,especially because of Yukiteru's poor written character.At first, she wasn't that bad but after some time her level of obsession got higher and it got annoying as hell. iknow she is the one of the most popular girls on MAL but I just can't force myself to like her, like it or not.\
Minene Uryuu: When I first saw her I was like who the hell is this crazy psychopath but as I watched more and more episodes I started to really like Uryuu,she is my favourite character from the series.I like how she is kinda tsundere, but she is not really annoying like some tsundere girls are used to be.\
Akise Aru: I like him too,he is badass and cool in his own way.I won't talk so much about him, I'll just say he is pretty good character.\
Enjoyment: 6\
\
I gave it six because two main charaters are really waste for the plot.I guess if Yukiteru was better written, I think this anime would be a lot better,so would be enjoyment.\
Overall: 6\
In short, anime is okay and I recommend you to watch it because plot is interesting and it is not a waste of time, and even though it has bad written characters I think it is worth watching.\

    Mirai Nikki was a show that sucked from the beginning til the sweet final \"role credits\". The show tried and miserably failed to have any character development beyond \" Yuno is a psychopath\" and \" Yuki is a loser \", almost every plot point crumbles under its own absurdity.\

    Very minor spoilers.\
It's my second review and I can already feel myself becoming a jaded anime guy. Yikes. Let's get into it.\
Mirai Nikki is really popular on this site, so I'm assuming there's some kind of cult following but that's not really what this is about. We grade on merit only, baby.\
When I review, I like to see how well a show reaches the audience's ideal version of the show. What is the ideal version of MN? I'm not really that sure. I think it would be very gruesome (R-rated level), have a lot of twists, and be thought-provoking to some level. MN is mostly\

        a thriller, and it seems like it wants to have drama and action elements mixed in. It only accomplishes this mix-in to limited success. What it boils down to is that most of the production attributes don't allow MN to really be what it wants. If MN were what it wanted to be, it would be really good. There are a bunch of good ideas and missed opportunities in here, but they don't get fleshed out enough, for various reasons.\
\
Story: 6\
Real quick, you have a bunch of people who get diaries of a certain aspect of the future. They play last-man-standing, and the winner becomes the god of time and space.\
While watching, I was very bored with the story for a while. For a greater chunk of the story, the plot is just about fighting through a gauntlet of diary users as they each try to kill Yukki and Yuna. I found this phase to be just... really boring. There's not much going on. It's the beginning and I can understand that being very slow. It helps you ground yourself in the world. But nothing new is happening. You get used to Yuna being crazy a few episodes in (or at least you think you do). That's all these episodes accomplish. There's no character growth. It's not really action-focused. There's no interesting interplay between diary users. There's no forward momentum, to feel like they're scaling up to fight a big boss. It just feels like they're setting the stage of the story but it is really taking too long. \
When Yuna and Yukki finish fighting the 7ths, the plot starts to ramp up. Characters start getting developed a bit, mysteries surrounding Yuna get brought into the spotlight, and the bigger questions regarding the end of the survival game get murkier. Once this happened, I took a liking to the series. It's interesting because the reminds me exactly of my experience with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I was very bored for the first 40ish episodes, but once we reached the final act I was on the edge of my seat seeing the various conclusions for each group of characters. MN doesn't succeed nearly as well as FMA: B, but it's the same idea.\
From here, we see dramatic changes in our characters and get more exposed to the background of Yuna, until we reach the real final act. The real final act is more supernatural than the rest of the show is, but I think it's a totally fine ending. There are a reasonable amount of questionable plot developments (they don't call him Deus Ex Machina for nothing), but none of them are that bad. I think if you're willing to jab at a show for minor plot inconsistencies, you already don't like the show for other reasons (unless the plot inconsistencies are fueled by character inconsistencies, then you're in the clear). The pace picks up a lot from here, and it's sort of a mad dash to the finish line. Yuna reveals a lot about herself and her motives. There isn't much time to meditate on that, and that's OK. \
Overall, I think the plot could use a little trimming. The first half of the show is slow and the few plot points that are generated here can probably be boiled down by reducing the number of diary users and maybe squishing a few unnecessary characters together. The latter half was 'good'. The whole thing is 'fair'. In an ideal MN world, you'd want to see more action, more diary interplay, or more character development in the first act.\
\
Art: 6\
I don't think the art is really that bad, but it doesn't serve the ideal MN experience. Let's start general. Some of the CGI is annoying. The modeling is often unrefined. I'm a stickler for models that don't look like they fit in well enough. Character drawings get really lazy if they are far away from the camera. Looks very sloppy. Character design is... sometimes stale, but generally good. Sometimes characters just look bizzare and have poor proportions/angles. \
Furthermore, I don't think the style supposed what MN wants to be. A big thing with MN should be gruesome, impactful, scenic violence. Tarantino-type stuff. The action isn't fast, but you want to feel it. Firstly, blood in this series is pretty poorly done. Most of the time it looks like dark-red smudges. I want to see satisfying, gruesomely red blood. Make me feel it. Same thing with the knives. There are so many slicing objects in here and they don't really shine. Animating metal like that can be tricky, but it is worth it. It makes a huge difference. A super cartoony knife just doesn't feel like a knife, it lacks the proper lighting and angles to really believe it. Also in general, the style is pretty bubbly and doesn't use shadows and dynamically as it should. A dynamic art style, like the kind you see in One Punch Man, does wonders to set the tone of the scene. When MN tries to be a thriller, I want to see dark shadows and contrast, dramatic cuts, and disturbing detail. When it's action, I want to see fast-paced tracking shots and crazy motion blur. It matters. MN goes too bubbly, for a style which is totally average for anime. But that's not what's best for MN. \
\
Sound: 7\
OP1 and ED1 are good. ED2 is fantastic. OP2 is weird and in English with heavy accent, not sure how I feel about it. The score pieces are hit and miss. Some are pretty good, others are pretty awful. My least favorite part is the screams in this series. And there's a lot of them. Anime screams are a big deal because they are easy to do sooo poorly. They're bad in this. They need to be good. It's a thriller! That's all. Everything else is totally average from what I can tell.\
\
\
Character: 7\
I was going to give this like a 4 but many of the longstanding characters redeemed themselves by the end. In the gauntlet phase of the plot, nearly all characters are forgettable, since they don't impact Yuna or Yukki in any meaningful way. There are some decent character moments though. 12th, 7thM, and Kousaki all have some pretty funny/unique scenes, which I think more of these background characters could do with. A different show that does this well is My Hero Academia do this well. But really, Yukki's friends and a majority of the diary holders are super, super bland. 7thM and Minene (and Nishijima, I kind of count him as part of her character) and pretty decent characters that feel like the impact Yukki. The rest of the side characters are worthless. \
Yukki starts off super annoying. He starts getting involved with 11th, his personality dramatically changes, and for good reason. He turns into just one of those I'm-a-heartless-know-it-all main characters, which sucks, but then he softens up again so it's OK. During the final act, he has to do a lot of shit, and his character gets put to the test. In the end, he ends up being a pretty decent character. I just wish he would shut up about stargazing. Seriously, that hook got so old. Something that I resonate with is that when Yuna tells him why he loves her, he doesn't put up a fight at all. It seems like he accepts it. But even waaaayyy later, he is only thinking about her. Even if what they had shouldn't be unique. To me, that's pretty relatable. Them's some damaged good. Maybe I should get myself checked out.\
Yuna. This is my first super yandere-focused show. This show is ALL about Yuna. Like, you can tell by just how much spotlight she has in the OP and EDs. You just don't really understand the extent of her involvement in the plot until the endgame. At first, I found Yuna to be a super intoxicating character. Yandere are entertaining, and she starts off a good one. Then, like everyone else, she is annoying for a majority of the show. Her actions are totally predictable and there's very little change in the types of situations she is put in. She is crazy, we get it. But you don't really get a sense for HOW crazy she is until the final act. The mysteries surrounding her life and the survival game really start to balloon, and this is what sets the pace for the ending episodes. From episodes ~19 and on, I quite like her character. She seems thoughtful, and the situations she is put in are more nuanced. I just wish she were less of a binary switch in the first 18 episodes. Her personality is entirely based on if she is alone with Yukki/if Yukki is in danger. It's a drag. I honestly would've liked to see more of her violent tendencies and for more fights.\
\
Enjoyment: 7 \
I feel like I've covered this in the other sections. Pretty much the first half was a drag, but the characters and intrigue pick up in the second act. Your first half should be good! Also, when the show tries to be an action thriller, which is often, it doesn't really succeed. Seriously, the visuals and pacing need more weight to them. A lot of the drama doesn't work either. But in the end, I'm glad to have watched it. The ending parts will give me something to think about for tomorrow. \
\
\
Overall: 6\
Well, that's that. I've been over pretty much everything I can think of. The biggest thing holding this down is the first act, but I really don't see this ever getting higher than a 7 from me, even if my enjoyment were more consistent. The elements of the work just aren't very cohesive and there are too many missed opportunities when trying to execute on tone and mood. Honestly, as I continue doing these reviews and reach peak jaded anime nerd, this is a series that I could see myself re-scoring as low as a 4, but I need more samples to be sure. \
Oh, and the little character samples after the credits are a neat idea. Not necessarily executed well in this show, but it's a cool idea that I would like to see more of.\

Story: 7\
Let's start with this. Ok, the setup is good, basically an idiot gets a diary that makes his life easier, but soon understands that he's probably fked up. Then something similar to a battle royale starts, and the one of all the diary possessors that survives become the next god (Not powerful enough doh). The plot is overall nicely executed.\

OST is nothing particular. Kuusou mesorogiwi saves the day.\
Voice acting in the japanese version is perfect. \"Yukki yukki yukki\"\

Character developement sucks. In 1 episode Yuki becomes a bastard, and Yuno backstory is so generic and doesn't explains her yandere mode for Yuki. The plot twists made character ridicoulous, like Mikami, for example, or Akise and Murumuru.\
Enjoyment: 8\
I can't say that i didn't enjoyed Mirai Nikki, finding flaws is so funny for me. Overall the series doesn't suck that much, it's ok to watch it, and you may like it if you're a newcomer.\
Overall: 6\
I know that Mirai Nikki is somewhat a Love or Hate series, it has been praised or just demolished, but i am in the middle of the cyclone, and i give it a 6. To me is a 6.5, but i can't give it 7, so here i am. Every anime fan needs to watch this show, just to go on reddit and discuss about it. AAAAnd if you are going out with an anime fan that happens to be some1 who you like just ask \"Did you like Mirai Nikki?\" and repeat what he says, it's a bang in their heart.\

Its a Gory, but Fun anime.  The story was amazing, art, sound, characters, everything was great!  I loved every bit of it.  If you haven't heard of Yuno, or seen any of the poster things that have Yuno in it, then you should watch this, and understand why she's so feared.\
I wasnt expecting the anime to have as much depth to it as i thought it was.  It was great, and it kept me wanting more.  Infact, they leave it off to where they can do a 2nd season,\
          \
        but i dont see that happening.  I read somewhere that they might be doing a live action version of it, but i dont want them doing that.  Leave it as an anime, and continue the story that way.\
All the characters were different in that each of their Future Diaries were different in the way they worked, and the way they interacted with each character.\
The Ending is Fun, but i wont spoil anything about it.  Because to feel the full effects of the ending, I wont tell you How it ends, or how it made me feel.  You'll just have to watch it for yourself.\
I enjoyed it 10/10.  Every time someone's limb came off, or someone got stabbed, i would freak out!!!  Explosions where a common occurrence as well.\
Mirai Nikki (The Future Diary).\
WATCH IT NOW!!!!  ITS REALLY GOOD AND TOTALLY WORTH IT!!\

 The main male protagonist of the series and the First Diary user. Also known as Yuki (ユッキー, Yukkī), he is a 14 year old middle schooler who is a rather quiet boy with an anti-social behavior who doesn't talk much. He mostly sees things around him as a bystander and writes it down in his cell phone diary. Yuki becomes involved in the Diary Game when to his shock that Deus, a god-like being whom he thought was an imaginary friend turns out to be real, selects him as one of twelve contestants in a 90 day battle royale where they must kill each other using their special diaries where the last survivor becomes Deus' new heir. Yuki's diary is called the Random Diary, which written from his point of view, gives a detailed explanation of his surroundings very accurately whether it be the present or the future. While versatile in any situation, the main disadvantage of the Random Diary is that it doesn't tells him what is happening to himself which leaves him vulnerable. Furthermore, since the diary is written from his point of view, Yuki can be tricked into thinking something he sees is true without realizing it which is a disadvantage for other people who use the Random Diary.\
 \
 Unlike most of the contestants, Yuki doesn't want any part of the game as he just wants to live peacefully and doesn't want to kill anyone, but is forced to play to survive and will only kill as a last resort as he is the main target by the other diary users because Deus sees Yuki as his favorite to win. Because he is weak, in order to protect himself, he quickly makes friends and allies to help him including Yuno Gasai, a girl in his class who is madly in love with him and is another diary user. Yuki is kind person yet is naive for quickly trusting people whether they be friend or other diary users as they may have ulterior motives. The most complex relationship he has is Yuno, while Yuno is a formidable ally, her mad obsessive love for him to the point she is willing to kill or use anyone so both of them can survive scares him yet despite the many things she does that shocks him. Despite this, Yuki still relies on Yuno in order to protect himself.\
 \
 Originally, Yuki's main goal was to find a way to end the game peacefully without killing anyone but that goal quickly changes when during the middle of the game, his mother is accidentally killed by his father, who is also later killed by agents of John Bacchus, the Eleventh Diary user. Grieving over his parents death, Yuno seduces and convinces him that in order to bring his parents back to life, he should win the game and once he becomes the new God of Time and Space, he can use his divine powers to bring them back from the dead. With this new goal, Yuki becomes determined to win no matter what including lying, killing, backstabbing and destruction. His new behavior shocks his friends as his and Yuno actions cause a series of terrorist attacks across the city.\
 He is named after Jupiter, the Roman god of the sky, weather and lightning.\

 Famous quote: <i>\"I'm crazy!? What's crazy is this world, that refuses to let me be with you.\"</i>\
 \
 Yuno Gasai is obsessively in love with Yukiteru (Yandere) as one can safely guess from just the simple name of her future diary. Yukiteru's condition and actions are recorded every ten minutes in her \"Yukiteru\" diary, it also provides small commentary made by Yuno in some of the entries. Its most obvious weakness is that it does not show Yuno's future at all&mdash;her condition, situation, or surroundings&mdash;unless it somehow involves Yuki. Working with Yukiteru's \"Random Diary\" diary, however, covers both of their diaries' individual flaws; as it has been said the two make for a perfect combo.\
 \
 Smart, beautiful and diligent&mdash;those who don't truly know Gasai Yuno would simply see the model student role she plays while at school. She is secretly obsessed with Yukiteru and would do anything within her power to assist him. She can be quite clingy and is highly fond of stalking him. When obstacles arise that either endangers Yukki's life or threatens their relationship, her thoughts turn murderous and she lets nothing get in the way of her path. Yuno is also able to quickly analyze and adapt to unexpected situations that may arise, and she puts thoughts into action without hesitation, performing what needs to be done without ever losing her nerves. These traits make her one of the strongest players in Deus's game, despite having one of the weakest diaries for providing self survival aid. And while Yukiteru is credited for triggering the greatest shift in future occurrences, Yuno is the one who has created the largest influence in those events. Yuno tends to carry around a box cutter with her at all times, though she will make use of other weaponry such as kitchen knives, hatchets, etc, when required.\
 \
 Near the end, when Yuki and company begin to seriously question Yuno's motives, Aru Akise investigated the 3 nameless corpses in Yuno's closet. He discovered two were Yuno's parents, whom she had accidentally starved to death, and that the last one was a perfect DNA match to Yuno herself. While Yuki shrugged this off initially, Aru investigated further and discovered that the Yuno Gasai he knew was actually from a separate dimension that had already won Deus' game and become god, at the price of Yuki's life. She then set out to the dimension where the story takes place, killing this worlds Yuno and taking her place by Yuki's side in her second game. Yuno kills Aru before he can specifically tell Yuki about the situation.\
 \
 \
 After a final confrontation between herself and Mur Mur against Yuki and Ninth, she heads to a third world where she hopes to try again, trapping Yuki in an alternate reality. Yuki is able to break free and manages to save the third world's Yuno before first Yuno attempts to kill her. Yuki talks her down, and first Yuno commits suicide by stabbing herself in the abdomen, causing Yuki to become god.\
 She is named after Juno (pronounced yu-no in Latin), the Roman goddess of Motherhood and Femininity.\

 A classmate in Yukiteru's school, Aru Akise dreams of one day becoming the world's greatest detective. The student detective is able to correctly deduce the culprit behind the serial dog murders even before the police. \
 \
 He is mistaken for being a future diary holder due to his quick wits and superior deduction abilities. An additional evidence of his supernatural intelligence is shown through few arcs, where only Akise is able to compete against Yuno's analytical, deceptive mind. His physical prowess is nothing to scoff at either as he is able to overpower and out maneuver a psychotic Yuno in two encounters. \
 \
 His reason for involving himself with Yukiteru and the Diary affair is left vague at first. But as he participated in the investigation of the Diary Holders and worked with Masumi and Minene, and after revealing himself to be apart of Nishijima's plan to eliminate the 11th, Akise calls a meeting at his house and reveals his intentions of wanting Yukiteru to become god, yet stating his deep distrust of the 2nd, Yuno. \
 \
 In chapter 17 of Mirai Nikki, Akise admits in secret to Yuno that he likes Yukiteru beyond friendship, leading her to panic momentarily when he purposely wraps his arm around Yukiteru's waist to aggravate her. This might be one of the reason why Yuno is so anxious and aggravated whenever Akise is appears in front of Yukiteru. \
 \
 Finally, in chapter 48, Akise admits to Deus that he is in love with Yukiteru, however Deus revealed that he only made him believe he did. Akise, desperate to prove his independence from Deus' will, claims a future diary and returns, attempting to convince Yuki that Yuno is using him. \
 \
 Yuno attempts to kill Akise, but his diary's power allows him to forsee her actions and guard against them. \
 Mirai Nikki Paradox\

 He is the main character in a spin off series (Mirai Nikki Paradox) where Murumuru accidentally destroyed Yuno from existence, meaning Yukiteru is still vulnerable from the Third. So until the damage is fixed, Aru collaborates with Murumuru and together, take the place of the First and Second. \
 \
 When Akise sees Yukiteru for the first time, his heart thumps, causing him to wonder out loud \"Is this love?\" leading to confusion on Murumuru's part. He also states that his reward for killing the Third is for Murumuru to save Yukiteru. By the end of second chapter of \"Paradox\", Murumuru suspects he is gay because of his strange actions around a recovering Yukiteru; refusing to leave his side because Yukiteru's just too cute, stating how he could kill all the diary users to make Yukiteru 'God', and so on. \

 While trying to kill himself, Yukiteru, Yuno, and Tsubaki through the use of a bomb, Yuno manages to stop Yomotsu and he ends up killing only himself as the bomb explodes. \
 Yomotsu is quite possibly insane and fancies calling himself a Hero of Justice. He talks using katakana and not the more common hiragana. He defines justice as always being on the side of the winner. He wears spandex along with a toy transformation belt as seen in many super sentai series, as well as a strange one-hole mask which bears similarities to a large eyeball. \
 \
 He is named after Pluto (Hades) &mdash;the Roman god of the Afterlife. \

 Tsubaki Kasugano is a maiden and figurehead of the Omekata religion. Her \"Thousand League Eyes\" diary is unlike the other diaries, as it is a scroll, rather than a cell phone. As its name would suggest, it is able to report the future of all her followers. Unlike Yukiteru's diary, it is not limited to just her surroundings, but also sees far events, such as seeing the events Yuki had accomplished a great distance away from where she resides. Her diary can also record near events; the short-term future that will occur after only a few seconds away from the present. This provides Tsubaki with massive amounts of information to work with. However, it can pose as a hindrance in times where a situation changes constantly or when she needs to react quickly.\
 \
  She was born with bad eyesight, only able to see a few feet in front of her. Her parents capitalized on this by setting her up as an \"oracle\" and creating a cult around her. After her parents died in a car crash, however, she became a plaything for the Omekata and was even raped by it's members. As a result of her experiences, she has become jaded with the world beyond her vision, and wishes for it to disappear. Tsubaki wants Yukiteru's abilities in order to avoid the prediction her diary made about herself. As she is able to control her worshippers, Tsubaki does not make use of any weaponry.\
 \
 When Yuki and Yuno travel in time to the next world their actions shape a future in which Tsubaki's parents never take their fatal car ride. This prevents the cult's transformation into an evil cult, and Tsubaki is spared from her horrible fate.\
 She is named after Proserpina (Persephone) &mdash; roman goddess of Underworld.　The characters of her name mean \"Spring\" (春), \"Day\" (日), \"Field\" (野), and \"Camellia\"(椿), respectively.\

 Due to having blogged many times on his cellphone, which is connected to the Eighth's diary, he becomes a \"Diary Holder Apprentice\". His diary helps him save his friends, but it only reveals his successes, not his failures, which makes Yuno able to shoot him with a crossbow. Since he is inadvertently working as the Eighth's spy, Yukki destroys his diary in chapter twenty-seven, though does not die because it was not a true future diary. \

 Keigo Kurusu is a police officer, so it follows with reason that his diary relates to his work. The \"Investigation\" diary gives Keigo information of future crimes and activities committed anywhere within the prefecture he is assigned to. Whether or not this means his diary can record events that will happen simultaneously in different locations is still up in the air. Its major flaw is a location issue; his diary is rendered useless at predicting anywhere outside his patrolling district.\

The latter rank appears to give users the same abilities that the original diary holders possess without the drawback of the user dying if his or her diary is destroyed.

 Minene Uryuu is a terrorist bomber. Like the Fourth, her \"Escape\" diary goes along with the type of profession she is involved in. Whenever Minene faces a dire situation, the diary will chart out the best course of actions she can take in order to get out of a tight spot. Based on the function of her diary, it might even help reduce the chances of her receiving a Dead End and it is probably one of the best diaries to have in Deus' game of survival. The diary's only shortcoming is that there are some circumstances where the odds are too heavily stacked against Minene to the point where the diary won't be able to secure an escape route for her. \
 \
 An infamous atheistic terrorist, Minene is a young woman who bears a strong hatred for organized religion, particularly God. \
 \
 Her hatred of religion stems from her past when she and parents were traveling in a city in the Middle East but got caught in a battle, which is hinted between Israelis and Palestinians, where her parents were killed in the crossfire. Blaming God for her parents' death, she leads a crusade of destruction against those associated with God. \
 \
 Minene got involved in the Diary game after a failed assassination to kill a Catholic Cardinal. She tried to escape but almost fell to her death and was saved by Deus, who gave her an offer to save her if she joined his game. Minene's diary is the Escape Diary, which will chart out the best course of actions for her to escape whenever she finds herself in a dangerous situation. While it means she can escape anything, it is not perfect as the diary can only tell her how to escape if there are favorably conditions that allow her any chance to escape. \
 \
 Originally, she wants to win the game to destroy religion worldwide but later mellows out after befriending Yuki and his friends. While she began as an antagonist against Yuki, she later became his ally, becoming a big sister figure to him and both of them hold no animosity with each other despite Minene was responsible for the destruction and deaths at his school and Yuki was the one who blinded her left eye. She shares an interesting relationship with Masumi Nishijima of the police whom she met during her failed assassination of the Cardinal. While she constantly dismisses all of his attempts to get to know her, she finally relents and eventually falls in love with Masumi. \
 \
 In the anime, during the last episode it was shown that Minene, from the second world, and Masumi, from the third world live together and have two children. Third world Minene is still a terrorist. \
 She is named after Minerva &mdash; the Roman goddess of wisdom, commerce, weaving, crafts and magic. \
