    'Mushishi' is an episodic anime that has only one main character~ Ginko.  Ginko's purpose is to travel from town to town, researching a phenomenon called 'mushi' and their effects on humanity.  He also helps the different villages deal with any mushi 'problems' they may encounter.\
Story:\
This is the SINGLE MOST beautiful and original story I have ever seen, both inside and outside the anime community.  The concept of 'mushi'~ an entity that is neither human, plant, or animal, that affects the daily lives of humans is intelligent and thought-provoking.  How Ginko deals with these phenomenon, whether he is just researching or 'treating'\
          \
        them is even more compelling.  Mushishi's stories have great life lessons hidden within them, and they are brought to life beautifully.\
Art:\
Beautiful.  Gorgeous.  Breath-taking.  What else is there to say?  The scenery art for this series is some of the best I have ever seen.  My only complaints about the artwork in this series, is the character art (other than Ginko's).  The different characters who appear episode after episode seem to be drawn identically, but just with new clothes and a name tacked on to differentiate them from the last episode.  However, this is easily over-looked because of the characters themselves (which will be discussed later.)\
Sound:\
Well, I'm afraid my review will fall short here.  I'm afraid sound is not usually something I really pay attention to, typically.  I will say, however, that the OP song is one of my favorites (if not my favorite) among all anime I have seen.  Yes, it may be my age saying this, but it is reminiscent of the old 70's folk music that I love so much.  It really is a beautiful song.  I'm giving the sound a 10, though, based on this song, and the music I did notice through the series, which was quite appropriate for the scenes.\
Character:\
Aaaaaahhhh...  the BEST part of the series.  Ginko... Ginko... well, he's just awesome.  Sometimes he may come across as one of your old 'monotone' teachers/professors, but you get the feeling that he truly LOVES what he does, and the interest he has in researching the mushi is undeniable.  The way he sees mushi as neither 'evil or good' ... they 'just exist, like we do' is a testament to his character.  Another great thing about this series is the episodic characters.  Other than Ginko (and a doctor that shows up in 3 episodes), all characters are only present for 1 episode.  But as someone states in the forums, you come to care MORE about some of these 1 episode characters than you do for some recurring characters in other 26+ epi series.\
Enjoyment:\
Well, if it isn't obvious by now, I enjoyed/am enjoying this series immensely.  I was not sure if I could enjoy an episodic anime with new characters introduced each episode, but I was pleasantly surprised.  This series has become quite endearing to me, and has taken it's spot as my #1 favorite series of all time.  All of the different aspects of this series, good as they are, individually, combine to make one hell of an awesome and original series.\
Overall:\
The verdict... (as if it wasn't obvious)...  10/10.  This is definitely a series worth watching, and definitely one of THE MOST UNDERRATED anime series out there.  Please enjoy it, soon... and let's all spread the Mushishi &lt;3.  :3\

Everything is only as it is.&rdquo;\
\
Story\
Mushishi is essentially a series of stories styled after East Asian legends and folktales. In lieu of gods, spirits, and demons, the paranormal phenomena are attributed to more primitive yet no less enigmatic creatures called &ldquo;mushi&rdquo;. Dealing with their kind is the expertise of &ldquo;mushishi&rdquo;; professionals whose role may be thought of as an amalgam of healer, exorcist, biologist, X-Files investigator, and Jedi master (well, sort of). Ginko happens to be one of these mushishi and he wanders from town to town, looking for interesting cases and lending a helping hand\
          \
        to those adversely affected by these mushi.\
As formulaic as its premise may sound, no two incidents are alike and every episode features not only different mushi but a different setting and cast as well (with Ginko as constant exception). Because of these, the series is able to experiment with various concepts and human relationships and none of the stories ever end in a predictable manner. As such, there is little room for stagnation as each tale manages to be unique and refreshing. \
The title is often mentioned in the same breath as Kino no Tabi though Mushishi&rsquo;s oriental setting and animistic influences give it a more distinct flavor and theme. Whereas Kino limits herself to exploring &ldquo;what if&rdquo; scenarios by visiting different countries, Ginko takes it a step further by providing possible solutions and emphasizing the importance of living in harmony with nature, with fellow men, and most importantly, with the self.\
Characters:\
While not exactly an anti-hero, Ginko&rsquo;s personality is an unusual mix of benevolence tempered with common sense; a combination of &ldquo;grace to accept with serenity the things that cannot be changed, courage to change the things that should be changed, and the wisdom to distinguish one from the other.&rdquo; Saving lives is part of his job but he also knows when there&rsquo;s reason still to hope and when it&rsquo;s time to move on. He may break his own code at times for the well-being of the majority and he&rsquo;s not above fooling the gullible either just to get by. His expertise stems not only from his knowledge about mushi but also from his understanding of human nature. \
Similarly, none of these supporting characters are shoved into stereotypes which plague most anime and manga. No catgirls, lecherous geezers, or single-minded youngsters (Believe it!); just regular folks in unusual circumstances due to encounters with mushi. Consequently, it doesn&rsquo;t require much effort to empathize with these characters even if most only appear in their respective episodes.\
Art:\
Not only is the theme &ldquo;everything is only as it is&rdquo; evident in the content but it also permeates the manner in which the stories are presented. Mushishi doesn&rsquo;t try to impress; it simply delivers. While other shows of this era tend go overboard with the fancy CG animation, Mushishi&rsquo;s visuals remain spare yet aesthetically pleasing. Rather than filling up the screen with explosions and fanservice shots at every possible moment, vivid scenes of natural beauty such as raindrops falling from the heavens, cherry blossoms drifting in the wind, and sunlight penetrating the dense foliage are shown instead. Of course, the viewers are occasionally treated to fantastic scenes showing the surreal characteristics of the mushi but these are shown only when called for in the stories and nothing is done in excess. Even the character designs are relatively plain but perhaps these also contribute to the story in their own way since the audience is less likely to judge the characters based on their appearances.\
Sound:\
Likewise, the audio takes the minimalist approach. The soundtrack is comprised of simply melodies which are surprisingly effective in evoking various thoughts and emotions. Ranging from haunting and heart-rending to hopeful and bittersweet, the music often eliminates the need for more words in the most crucial scenes. Also worth noting is the lack of exaggerated voice acting which makes the cast sound more like real people rather than cookie-cutter characters.\
Overall:\
In addition to its enchanting audio and visuals, Mushishi also serves drama and thought-provoking content in balanced amounts. Its subtle content and execution never insult the intelligence and present several interesting ideas without drowning the viewers in philosophical jargon or sophistry. All in all, Mushishi truly is one of the finest anime specimen out there.\

    In spirit, at least, each episode of Mushishi strongly reminds me of one thing: A cave painting. A depiction of man and the outside world, brief and primal but perfectly expressive, radiating mysticism, perhaps possessed of more meaning than it initially appears to have.\
From minute one, Mushishi's representation of a vast world grabs the eye and doesn't let go. Lush forests with dew dripping from every leaf; barren winter mountains peppered with stubborn snow-covered trees; an innocuous pond with lilies on the surface of the still water. The series roams from setting to setting, and all are presented with a lifelike attention to detail. The\
          \
        color palette is richly varied, reaching from the brilliant emerald of vegetation to the deep turquoise of the sea to the dusky red of a far-off sunset. Lighting is used to strong effect, whether it's beams of sun streaming through layers of foliage and mist or a candle's flame struggling to brighten a dark old house. \
And within those habitats, the mushi themselves, creatively rendered as a strange mix of the familiar and the utterly alien—like shapeless blobs propelled by twitching motions, like phosphorescent insects scuttling along the earth, like great legless serpents twisting skyward. Some take the shape of a natural phenomenon, and the sight of a living rainbow exploding from the earth, or a long-restrained cloud breaking free, expanding and floating away, is bound to impress. The animation on the whole is excellent, but the mushi in particular seem to move with a vivid otherworldly fluidity. At least part of Mushishi is about making sense of the mysterious, bringing reason to something that seems unreasonable, and the designs of the mushi add some believability to this; it's quite easy to see how they could be thought of as ghosts, beasts, or legends, able to inspire both wonder and fear. The tranquility of the environments is consistently impressive in a low-key way, but the spectacle of the mushi can be eerie, majestic, and everything in between.\
Sound is part of atmosphere, and in the same way that cold urban horrors might use reverberations in dark alleys or the foreboding thrumming of electronics, Mushishi might use a chorus of insects or the roar of drifting snow to surround us, allowing the setting to speak its piece. The music is minimal but startlingly effective, in many cases fitting easily alongside and even seeming to mimic the voices of the earth. Slow piano notes overlap with rhythmic footsteps, a woodwind's sad screams resemble those of a forlorn bird. So, too, can the score sound almost unearthly, with an ominous progression of bells and chimes sometimes underscoring a haunting ending or signaling the arrival of the mushi. The result is an immersive ambiance where visuals and sound alone can convey dark, brooding tension or innocent curiosity with equal ease. It isn't just pretty, it's totally engrossing, exuding pure atmospheric mastery in almost every scene.\
Through this vast world walks Ginko, revenant of revenants, our looking glass. Perceptive of the nature of human and mushi alike, he uses words as careful and deliberate as his journeying stride to become the voice of reason and, with an air of serene confidence, impart his knowledge to others. To become a witness to needless death, a bearer of bad news, or a participant in deception is sometimes part of his job description. As an admirer of life and truth, he cares for none of these tasks, but he'll defy his own nature and undertake them with solemn dedication if he feels that it's necessary. He is wise, but not infallibly so. Nor is he a complete stoic; outbursts of childlike wonder at incredible sights, sarcastic retorts to smart-mouthed travelers, and emotion-laden shouts of panic and warning to his fellow humans all show him as a little more than just the nonchalant white-haired sage. His development, in the traditional sense, is sparse, but he is afforded a poignant backstory that makes him and his thought process a little less of an enigma.\
Of course, Mushishi gently pushes a picture of a sprawling and intricate world where all beings affect each other in ways both seen and unseen, their actions rippling outward in ever-widening circles, and in that sense, Ginko as a character is no different than any other living thing in the show, simultaneously of little and great consequence. He may be our guide, cursed and blessed to ceaselessly wander, but the world doesn't turn for him. Rather, it's in what he represents that we might find significance: The quest for knowledge, the insatiable desire to understand even while knowing that the sheer body of things in existence prevents total understanding. The need to capture the meaning of what surrounds us, spread our wisdom responsibly, and use it to form calculated reactions to the world instead of rash judgments. He truly is that silver fish swimming endlessly through dark water, opalescent barbels probing fathomless black crevices, illuminating them, if only for a brief moment. Much of Mushishi's strength lies in the ability to provoke thought without direct questions, to let an image serve as subtext, and Ginko himself represents an impressively seamless merging of humanity and idea.\
Mushishi is episodic, not bound by an overarching plot. It is a series of self-contained stories which vary in theme, but are always skillfully crafted. Most episodes consist of human drama, based on relatable and familiar emotions, infused with an element of the natural world. The episodic format delivers powerful and gripping tales in an extremely brief timetable, a feat which I have no problem appreciating. The scenarios are original, and the writing is rich with little subtleties and metaphors, but each episode can be understood and appreciated as successful story even if you've no desire to peer into them deeply. View Mushishi as a progression of intelligent parables full of interesting ideas, or as a bunch of moving and affecting tales; much to its credit, it is both.\
Part of what makes Mushishi work is its steadfast refusal to portray anything in terms as simple as “good” or “evil.” Stories where barbaric man stupidly abuses mother nature, or where nature is a hate-filled monster that comes from the hills to eat scared little man, are a dime a dozen, and while they might pass as entertainment, they often fail to say anything worth saying because they handle man and earth as if they're combatants in a holy war. Mushishi is not so black and white, and it has an idea that scales much better. The mushi are not red-toothed animals seeking to kill in droves. The humans are not greedy savages bent on scorching the earth. Both are just beings, trying to survive in the same place and at the same time. That they will cross paths, have conflicting interests, use each other, and hurt each other is inevitable; such is survival. Each episode is one meeting of mushi and human, one miniscule butting of heads in a massive world, with the implication being that this is simply what happens, everywhere. Instead of vilifying humans or portraying nature as a vengeful power, Mushishi whispers: This is just the way things are. It does give us a small shove by implying that, as the ones with the ability to reason and understand, the responsibility for mitigating the damage that humans inflict (and the damage that humans receive) falls on the humans, but it never degenerates into the preachy heavy-handedness or gross oversimplifications that plague many works with similar themes.\
It's that theme which allows Mushishi to navigate the spectrum of human emotion. Conflict in its world does not arise from moral failings or piggish greed, only from a lack of understanding, and understanding is a sword with many edges. Ask the child who learns of death, or the old man who learns of life. Sometimes the knowledge you gain is liberating, sometimes it's disheartening, sometimes it's terrifying. Mushishi can be all of those words and more, but even when it strays to one extreme, it never loses its humanity, its worldliness, or its feeling of being completely natural. Just as it can depict the warm orange rays of the sun and the cold white howl of the snow, it can depict innocent wonder and violent loss, and with equal sincerity. It has balance, and then some.\
As a caveat, I will say that this is the kind of series that practically begs me to use the phrase “not for everyone.” It's dialogue-heavy, more about the thought leading up to action than the action itself; it keeps the big guns of its visual spectacle on a tight leash, letting them explode only after a suitable buildup to assure the maximum payoff; it doesn't have the conventional storytelling satisfaction of explicitly coming full circle, instead simply tapering off and fading quietly, as episodic series sometimes do. A few episodes will likely be enough to inform you of whether or not it's to your tastes, and I've no doubt that many have labeled (and will continue to label) it as simply “boring.” I understand the origin of this opinion, but I just can't share it, because Mushishi is strangely beautiful and intensely fascinating on several levels. Imbibe it a little at a time like a fine liquor, or dive deeply into it and become drunk on its atmosphere, intrigue, and insights. In my experience, neither disappoints.\

    Some people will tell you Mushishi is great because it doesn’t contain action and fanservice. These must be the same people who praise a film for not including Adam Sandler. They also make Mushishi look more pretentious than it is. It’s far from it. The problem is, even though Mushishi has a worthwhile aim and the right methods, it doesn’t know how to use them.\
In order for something to be pretentious, it needs to put up a cover while not including the methods. An anime that has a realistic art style with dramatic characters is pretentious. It looks realistic, but the methods that are used\
          \
        are opposed to it.\
Mushishi makes it clear what it wants to be in the first episode. It’s a series that’s concerned mainly with men’s relationship to nature. The mushi are just the physical embodiment of what nature can be. Some have criticized Mushishi for creating a magic system that has no rules but leads to convenience, but that’s untrue. Mushishi doesn’t have an RPG-like magic system because it uses magic to explore themes, not to offer instructions on how to do battle.\
The rules the magic in Mushishi follows is the theme of nature. It’s successful in that department. We often see nature portrayed as a calm, peaceful place in contrast to heartless machinery. If the person is especially ignorant, we will even hear about the good old days when men was One With Nature and everything was peaceful and good. Most people see nature though the lens of the Garden of Eden.\
Anyone who ever bothered to learn a little about nature – botany or geology or zoology – will understand Mushishi‘s stance on nature. Nautre is unstable, mysterious, powerful and cares nothing about us. Volcanic eruptions and meteors crashing are terrible things, but they’re produced by an indifferent world that has no malice. They just happen. Then again, it’s the same world that gives us great food and visual spectacles. There plenty of time when the terrible and beautiful merge – how many dangerous animals are also beauiful?\
The series achieves that by the nature of the mushi. They often benefit and harm at the same time, like allowing people to give birth to a person that died. There is always a sense of wonder and mystery surrounding the mushi. Even Ginko, despite his cold demeanor is also startled by them. What people don’t say enough about Mushishi is that this is how fantasy should be done. It’s not like Martin’s world, which is full of details to make it clear and familiar. It’s truly alien and fantastical.\
Where the series falls is in all other departments. The series doesn’t put enough effort into the characters and the stories. They exist solely to present the varying mushi. There are films whose purpose is only to deliver a visual experience, so abandoning conventional storytelling can be a smart decision. It’s not here. It’s not just that 26 episodes make you demand more, but that abandoning conventional storytelling doesn’t help the series’ aim.\
The series forgets about the ‘men’ in the relationship between men and nature. The characters feel like they have an outer life. The issues spring from life itself – art, marriage, vision – rather than having a guy preventing another guy from Being the Best. There isn’t enough character psychology to make these issues feel important.\
The characters are all interchangeable. I kept waiting for a reason why this person is concerned with vision, or this one with marriage. Nothing is pointless in fiction, after all. In order to bring depth to an issue, you need to connect to the character. Something in the character’s personality needs to be related to the issue so it will affect it. A lot of shounen shows know this, so they tend to give a narcisstic nature to their characters. The character doesn’t just struggle with The Problem but with his own nature. Ikki learns to curb his narcissism and stop swinging between it and depression. Tai learns (or is supposed to) how being a leader works.\
Despite these two not being the most developed examples, they make for different stories. You couldn’t put Tai in Ikki’s story, because Tai’s personality is concerned with relationships with others. You couldn’t put Ikki in Tai’s story, because his story is about learning that sometimes you lose some and win some. I could not remember a character that had a situation concerned with his personality. They tend to have generic wants and needs, nothing that’s unique to them. They may be ‘ordinary people’, but people are not clones even when they follow patterns. Or if the series wanted to comment on that, then the similarity should’ve been made important. Nothing is there to emphasize how similar humans are. These are just empty characters.\
Ginko is not much better. An episodic series isn’t an excuse to have undeveloped characters. They may not change throughout the series, but they need a personality that will affect every story. A lot of Cartoon Network shows are purely episodic, yet they’re full of quirky characters who create the stories because of who they are.\
We get a backstory episode for Ginko, but it doesn’t reveal much. What’s his motivation? Why is he so into mushi? How does all this exploring affected his worldview? There are sometimes hints. In one episode, Ginko agrees with what I wrote above about the cruelty of nature. This is just one instant, though. All Ginko does is visit people, help them solve the problem and that’s it.\
That makes him a plot device, not a real character. He exists so we’ll have someone to follow, but how different would the series be if it was a random mushishi in every episode? I do not ask to immidiately reveal who Ginko is. If every episode gave a small piece, it would be enough. The collector, who appears from time to time is the only person with something resembling a drive. He’s really into collecting, and values it more than humans. It’s a little touch that makes him more real than anyone here. There are sometimes other mushishi’s who act a little different, but the difference is never wide enough.\
It’s a missed oppurtunity, sure, but not one without merits. It’s as original as people say it is, and a good example of how far storytelling can go. It didn’t live up to its concept, but it’s still good that it’s out there and that it found an audience. Hopefully, one of these someone will pick up these ideas and run away with them. It’s a fun series, but one that should be easy to improve.\

    This anime was a very  unique experience. The show introduces a very interesting concept called the mushi. It'd be very difficult to describe what the mushi are precisely. In a nutshell , they're essentially spiritual beings, but at the same time they inhabit the physical world ( Yeah I know what your thinking, you just completely contradicted yourself. I know, I know just go with it) and they use humans as a host ( very similar to a parasite). One aspect in particular that struck me about the show was how it was devoid of any western influences whatsoever. Many anime fans don't realize\
          \
        how anime is indeed heavily influenced by Western culture. But Mushi-shi primarily borrows stories from many east Asian folklore and myths. Although Mushi-shi does offer an original and innovative premise/concept, the execution is most certainly flawed. \
Story \
The story of Mushi-shi follows the exploits of Ginko, who is otherwise known as the Mushi-shi or Mushi master in the English dub. Ginko's job as a Mushi-shi is to go around and help people who have been infected by the mushi. This is one of the flaws to Musi-shi, which is it's formulaic plot. As you go through these episodes you'll notice that 90% of the them play out like this: Ginko is wandering around, he encounters a village, group of people or an individual who have had an encounter with the mushi. Which in turn, leads to them being harmed to the point were they're crippled or their lives are hanging on by a thread. Ginko attempts to save them. His efforts leads them to being cured or sometimes the episode will end off tragically where the one infected dies. Basically, this formula repeats for 26 episodes. \
\
Yeah.....the series is a tad bit repetitive. \
Notice how I said a tad bit repetitive and not overly repetitive. Because what saves it is the mushi themselves, there isn't a single episode where the mushi are exactly the same; it's always fascinating to observe them, because the way they interact and work with humans is so compelling. Oh and did I forget to mention that Mushi-shi has no main storyline ? Yes, this is an episodic anime where each episode is it's own standalone story. This wasn't a problem for me, but I know it will be for some. Because of course, most people generally prefer a main ongoing story. Again this wasn't a problem for me. Also, when I say episodic, I mean it. It's not like Cowboy Bebop or Samurai Champloo, where it's episodic in nature but it has an overarching story. That’s not the case with Mushi-shi. Plus there's no recurring characters in the show except Ginko. I mean, if someone was to walk up to me and say \"hey, I found Mushi-shi to be a phenomenal anime and I absolutely loved it,\" I'd completely understand. If somebody else walked up to me and said \"hey, I found Mushi-shi to be extremely boring and I didn't like it,\" I'd also completely understand. Because of how literally quiet and subtle it is (not recommended if you got A.D.H.D), which isn't a bad thing by the way. Mushi-shi is definitely not for everyone; it's not meant to appeal to the masses, its meant for a niche audience who can truly appreciate its fascinating concept and artistry. It's very reminiscent of an independent arthouse film. \
Characters & Themes \
Now on to the themes and characters. This anime excels in that department. Mushi-shi does a fantastic job of exploring themes of loss, despair, self sacrifice, suffering and tragedy. Whenever the mushi infects people, family bonds are tested and death is always around the corner. If someone does in fact die or suffer a heavy loss, it always resonates with you. So yeah, clearly the show has a lot of emotional depth. Lets get into the characters, now as I mentioned before there are no recurring characters except for Ginko, and for the most part the anime does a fairly good job of fleshing out these nonrecurring characters. Especially considering the fact that each has only about 21 minutes (excludes opening and closing songs) of screen time. On to Ginko, whose obviously the main protagonist. You'll definitely take a liking to him as he's a very kindhearted individual. He does get a good amount of characterization and we do get a back story as to how he became a Mushi-shi/Mushi master. But really compared to other main protagonists its wasn't enough in my opinion. That's another one of my problems with Mushi-shi, Ginko needs to be fleshed out more. Nevertheless, he's an all around good main protagonist \
Sound \
Arguably the best part of Mushi-shi, from the score, to the voice acting and even just the sounds going on in the back ground. The opening track is called \" The Sore Feet Song\" by Ally Kerr and its a solid one overall. You'll probably enjoy it if you like folk rock. Something that is also very unique about Mushi-shi is the ending theme, or should I say ending themes, because every episode has its own closing song and I got to say, I liked all of them. It's hard to describe them because the instrumentation is so unique and each one feels so surreal and atmospheric. They have an otherworldly vibe to them. Then we have the actual score within the show which is also great and complements the mood excellently. Like the closing themes, the score has an otherworldly vibe as well that I can't put my finger on. Finally on to the voice acting, which is outstanding on both the Japanese sub and English Dub. No seriously, it's that good, especially the English dub which in my opinion surpasses the original Japanese and it ranks up there with Funimation’s best work like Baccano, Yu Yu Hakusho, and Fullmetal Alchemist. Both Yuto Nakano and Travis Willingham embody the character of Ginko perfectly, and all the other cast members do a great job as well especially considering that fact that they only appear once. Also, pay attention to the tone of the voice acting on both languages and notice how monotone and subtle it is. Don't let it discourage you. This is completely intentional because it's meant to match the quiet and subtle tone of the actual show. \
\
Art & Animation \
Finally, we get into the last part of the review, the art and animation. The animation is very good and smooth, but the art (especially the backgrounds) is absolutely stunning. You'll know what I mean when you watch the series for yourself, just pay close attention to the detail that is given here. From the lush green vegetation, to the mountains and rivers. It's absolutely gorgeous. I recall when I was watching it, I had to pause the show for a moment because the backgrounds were so beautiful to look at. Hands down, some of the best you'll find in all of anime. I guarantee it. \
Final Thoughts \
When it's all said and done, Mushi-shi has it's flaws and at the same time it has a lot of good things going for it. It's formulaic tendencies really held it back. Plus, Ginko could have been fleshed out more. Regardless of that, this anime was a joy to watch and it's a good solid one at that. If you have an open mind, I recommend you check it out, especially if you want something that is unique and original.\

    It's pretty rare to see a purely episodic anime that isn't a comedy, and that's just another reason Mushishi was such a treat.\
STORY - The series follows the journeys of a traveling Mushishi named Ginko who investigates paranormal phenomenon usually caused by creatures called Mushi. Each episode describes one of his encounters with self-sustaining villagers in and around vast mountain ranges. Something is wrong, and Ginko does what he can. It's very straightforward, but even though each episode more or less follows the same format, it isn't a simple case of Ginko saving the day every single time. Sometimes things are beyond his control; sometimes\
          \
        nothing can be done regardless, and sometimes, nothing need be done at all. It can be frustrating sometimes when Ginko has revelations that he won't explain until later, and because of the supernatural nature of the Mushi, Mushishi has quite an expository air to it. The mysteries aren't of the sort you can really deduce yourself, and there's a lot of talking and explanation.\
Nevertheless, the way the Mushi and humans interact can be very fascinating at times, disturbing at other times. Sometimes Mushishi feels like a cross between a nature documentary and a paranormal investigation. Fans of either would definitely enjoy this.\
CHARACTER - Ginko is really the only reoccurring character in the series, though his collector/doctor friend, Adashino, does show up now and again. Each episode contributes a different situation involving different people in a different place, and they almost never have anything to do with one another. Naturally, this means the exclusive cast of each episode remains pretty generic. There is the generic little girl and little boy character, the young woman, the young man, the middle-aged woman and man, the old woman and the man. Sure, the individual characters may have unique characteristics depending on their situation, but for the most part, the cares, worries, and priorities of each of these archetypes are standard. I didn't really mind though. After all, their situations did set them apart from one another, and as almost all these characters lived in small, self-sustained villages, it's conceivable to say that their lifestyles made them similar.\
Ginko, as the protagonist, gives us a little more depth and insight into his personality, but even he remains a mostly enigmatic character for the length of the series. His intentions are generally altruistic, but there is more to his actions than that. Actually, I wish Ginko's thoughts and personal feelings about Mushi are touched on more -- there are definitely morals and deeper philosophies involved, but they're only touched on in one or two episodes. Still, those are the episodes that give Ginko the most personality, and I think it's very easy to relate to him as a result. His quirky habits and mannerisms are kind of endearing too, and he's just a fun character to watch. He's easy-going: very fitting for this kind of episodic series.\
ARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - Mushishi definitely has some of the most gorgeous backgrounds for an animated series (as opposed to an animated movie) I've ever seen. The forests are lush with detail and vibrant colors. It floors me the way every plant and flower and tree branch and leaf is expressed. Views from mountaintops are breathtaking, and the oceans glitter with tiny waves and light. Cloud formations are grandiose and powerful, and the night sky is always vibrant with stars. These are some really, really amazing environments, man. \
The character designs, in contrast, are pretty plain. Ginko stands out with his white hair and teal eye (which have a legitimate explanation beyond 'he's an anime character!'), and his face is pretty unique in itself, but all those archetypal villagers? In every episode, you'll have deja vu. 'Hey, isn't that the character from the last episode?' No. It isn't. None of the villagers get repeat episodes, but you'll think so for a while because all of them look the same! Every little girl character looks like every other little girl character, and every middle-aged man villager looks like every other in the same category. It's actually pretty amusing, and I didn't particularly mind this repetition simply because... well, it doesn't matter all that much. Since none of the characters repeat, it isn't like it's that confusing. Anyway, I can accept that they blew all their character design budget on the backgrounds; it's really not that bad of a trade-off at all. :P\
I also really liked that Mushishi had a very tranquil air about it. The title screens of every episode appeared quietly into the existing scene, calmly and without interruption. There is no bridge animation/page to frame where the commercial break would be. It just fades in and out very smoothly.\
MUSIC - Mushishi has some really minimalistic music. The soundtrack throughout the series is mostly of the traditional Japanese sort -- bells, gongs, bamboo flutes, biwas, and other string instruments. They're all very, very fitting to the series and definitely enhance the scenes they're used in. They're moody, eerie, calming, and occasionally cheerful. Sometimes there's only silence, but that fits too. For being so minimal, the sounds in Mushishi are incredibly effective. \
The opening theme is already an indication of this. It's soft and slow and reminds me somewhat of something they'd play in a yoga class: soothing. The lyrics are in English (not Engrish!) and also fit very well with the themes of the series. I love the name of it too -- 'The Sore Feet Song.' The ending theme is always an instrumental and changes with every episode, something you don't see often at all. The composer is none other than Toshiou Masuda of Naruto fame, and he once again does an awesome, awesome job (even if you don't like the Naruto anime, it's hard to deny that it has an amazing soundtrack). The end themes are generally very mellow, bittersweet, which echos the endings of many episodes. More yoga music!\
VOICE ACTING - I saw all of the series subbed, and interesting enough, Mushishi has a gigantic cast list because there's a different voice actor for pretty much every single random villager character in the series. I thought since many of the villagers are reasonably similar, they'd just use one voice per archetype. No! All of these people have their own voice! I guess that's a pretty good way of making up for the lack of variation in visual designs, and it works out pretty well. It's worth noting that a majority of the little kid characters aren't annoying! Some of them are actually... reasonably cute? I really did enjoy Ginko's voice also; it's pretty 'normal' sounding, but it fits his character very well.\
Edit; I just discovered that the entirety of Mushishi is available streaming off FUNimation's website, dubbed. As such, I took the liberty of checking out a few episodes, and it's pretty good! I really wasn't sure about Ginko's voice at first, but Travis Willingham does a pretty decent imitation of Yuto Nakano's voice and it warms up to you fairly quickly. Willingham also somehow manages the same quirky kind of tone. While the American cast of villagers isn't quite as extensive as the Japanese, there are still a good number of varied talents there so it isn't too much repetition. All in all, I'd say FUNi did a pretty swell job.\
OVERALL - Mushishi might be one of those series you should watch a bit at a time just because it's entirely episodic and might feel a little repetitive in large doses. (I watched it all in two or three days, but hey, that's me.) There is no ending, and actually, I wouldn't mind seeing another season of this. There is an origin episode or two to flesh out Ginko's past and development as a character, but while they do help the general story along and I'm glad for them, I don't think they're entirely necessary either. If you like scientifically presented supernatural stuff and don't mind a very easy-come, easy-go story, then I'm sure you'll like Mushishi. :3",

    This review contains no major spoilers. I was beyond thrilled when I had finally got my hands on Mushishi in its entirety. I have to shamelessly admit that I'm pretty dang easily entertained. So typically when there is a show that EVERYONE seems to love, I tend to enjoy it just as much. Unfortunately, once I got around to getting into the series I found a number of issues that others just didn't seem to have. I was entertained on a number of episodes, and definitely compelled to complete it. However, this certainly wasn't the masterpiece I thought I was about to watch.\
Aesthetically this anime\
          \
        is among the best of the mid 2000s. Everything in this series just looks so damn good. The quality ranges all the way from the characters, to the many varying environments, and especially the mushi as they are drawn in a seemingly endless variety of colors, forms and sizes. There is really no \"rules\" when it comes to mushi so the creators can just draw whatever the heck they want. This leads to many off the wall forms, colors, shapes, matter, you get the idea. One of my favorite parts while watching was waiting to see what the next episode's mushi were going to look like. The dub is on par with the animation in that it's completely flawless. This is undoubtedly one of the best dubs out there. The music never really clicked with me, but it never detracted from the quality either, so no complaints from me there.\
Now the episodic story design and lack of main characters are where my feelings of this series seems to steer differently from the mass's . As much as I wanted to love this series, I just never got completely sucked in like my favorite shows always seem to have a way of doing. My first complaint is Ginko. He is our protagonist, mushi master, and the only real reoccurring character of the series (save for very brief multi-appearance of another) . Ginko is completely lacking in any trace of charisma. Actually, he lacks just about everything.  He really never expresses happiness, sadness, any emotions for that matter. There are a few instances where he verbally exclaims he is concerned with something or another, but it certainly doesn't feel sincere due to his stone face and never changing body language. Even in one instance where his life is in serious danger, he just stoically thinks to himself \"oh I'm gonna die, I don't want to....this isn't good\" with no feelings of urgency or emotion, as if he were thinking of a chore he had to do or something. He has absolutely zero development through out the series, and even the relationships he forms from episode to episode feel superficial. Every new acquaintance is simply a means of progressing the episodes with no hints of any realistic bonds being formed. Considering every other person in the series only gets 20 minutes of screen time at the absolute max, these flaws with his character are kind of a big deal. I understand they most likely meant his passive presence to allow for the individual stories to take center stage, but it rarely worked well in my opinion. I feel many of the stories would have benefited if Ginko were written in a way that we could relate or feel towards him. You can't have a great vagabond story if you can't feel for the guy ya know?  \
When it comes to the other characters, most are fine given the little time they do have. They are mostly believable with ranging personalities so it doesn't get bland. But it's hard to really form a solid judgement towards them one way or another due to how little time we actually get to spend with them. As for the stories? To be totally honest here, a number of them can be just flat out boring. It would be inaccurate to say that they're \"bad\". But many just don't really drag you in as much as I anticipated that they would. The series opens strong, the first DVD is pretty entertaining. As we're introduced to the world of Mushishi, its design and uniqueness ropes you in at the beginning. But as the show progresses it never actually builds on anything. Every episode begins with an inexplicable conflict, and of course every conflict is revealed to be the result of some different kind of mushi. The situation is then analyzed and the mushi are taken care of in some overly convenient new obscure manner. Rinse and repeat. This formula begins to grow stale. Like I said earlier, there are no rules for mushi. This is great for the artist's freedom, but not so great as a plot device. I've never been a huge stickler for realism, but many of the solutions seem waaaayyy overly convenient, because previously unknown mushi traits always pop up at just the right time. For example all of a sudden a hopeless situation will be resolved because moonlight hits a mushi, or in another instance sculpting some pottery on the spot leads to the fix of an otherwise incurable ailment. There are just so many completely random and off the wall solutions to many of the problems that the viewer is expected to just roll with. I feel that it definitely detracts some from some of the show's enjoyment. With such short stories, it's also just really hard to get engrossed in the characters and their problems. The series does have it's highlights of memorable episodes, particularly in the first few episodes and then again towards the end, but these moments of greatness aren't exactly the norm. Many of the stories in the middle are just on the dull side unfortunately. Despite being only 20 minutes a pop, some seem to drag, moving inexcusably slow while not really offering enough excitement to make you actually care whether or not things turn out for the better.\
Overall Mushishi is a very chill and relaxing show to watch. The stories are always at least pleasantly humble despite all else. I also never grew tired of the fresh animation in each episode. However, given all the hype I had heard, I found myself disappointed and longing for something more. This is an okay anime, but not the amazing series I had originally thought I was about to watch. 6/10\

    So what reason could there be to praise a show that's been reviewed four times already, receiving highest marks? The answer is simple enough: it's been a long time since an anime has impressed me as much as Mushishi did. Going beyond the boundaries of the entertainment-based pop culture, this deserves the term 'art' in every aspect.\
The provided synopsis could hardly be more accurate, yet does it tell little to nothing about the series. The reason for this is that Mushishi, unlike usual modern entertainment, convinces the viewer through style - aesthetics. There is no flashy, grotesque or absurd story, competing for attention among the\
          \
        cliche-ridden anime market. The plot flows like a calm streamlet, contemplative in its very essence.\
Each episode tells us a fascinating, coherent, artfully arranged tale revolving around Ginko and the people he meets on his journey, who are facing different consequences through the confrontation with the paranormal.\
The way the protagonist Ginko approaches the phenomenon 'Mushi' is open-minded, enquiring, yet discreet. \
Maybe we can go as far as to assume that the paranormal allegorizes the beauty of nature which rarely receives attention in today's perception (in fact is invisible to most!).\
But the anime does not teach - it shows, implicitly. In a  meditative way. Hence, the impression it delivers is so very strong. The viewer does not reject the wisdom it provides.\
Every episode deeply touched me, not just through its profound story but as well by means of sound and animation. The music conveys the atmopshere modest, soothing, simply beautiful - and sometimes there is no sound at all. Minimalistic perfection.\
The animation is astonishing - detailed sceneries of nature in every thinkable facet, backgrounds imbued with life.\
It was an unusual, enriching experience. Philosophical and artful - opposing commercialism and qualitative decline. Timeless.\

    There are many who struggle with wrapping their heads around certain folklore that is completely different from the cultural roots of their own country. It can be a herculean task for the ill-prepared minds that nevertheless wants to explore all facets of any country’s folklore that captures the entirety of how it’s culture evolved from its roots to the present. There hasn’t been many shows, or anime for that manner, that have handled folklore with the level of atmosphere and creativity that the show Mushishi has to offer and for this we have to be thankful for its existence. It’s beautiful existence to be more\
          \
        specific.\
How Mushishi develops itself from the ground up, in terms of its overall narrative, is by separating plot arcs into every individual episode that have their own personal story that all feel very unique and thought-provoking. The people, who Ginko comes across on these individual episodes, are never seen again as he tries to make sense of how these “Mushi” behave and how they adapt in the landscape of Mushishi’s world by engrossing them into the people. What makes it extraordinarily admirable is the level of detail that encompasses the entirety of the show despite not having an over-arching “story” from how almost every single character feel like actual people rather than one-dimensional caricatures that shows, like Mushishi, typically fall into when they try to do the same formula. I wouldn’t go so far that it’s every bit as perfect as one would hope but it’s more than enough for it to be garnered anything but warm praise for its in-depth characterization. Ginko himself proves to be a very competent lead in giving him the great detective mind that is akin to other great detective characters in other mystery works in the past by giving him a strong back-story to his past life and how he came into being a mushi-shi himself.\
The absence of an overarching narrative in Mushishi, however, doesn’t bold too well for it since it is bounded by a slight disconnect of a tightly structured world that it wants us to feel engrossed and connected but it ultimately doesn’t come across as anything but average. While most of the episodes prove to be good in-of-themselves, watching them altogether and trying to encapsulate the very nature of the particular world they want to portray feels empty and shallow. It wants to make an episodic show but at the same time it tries creates this living, breathing society on a macro-level that doesn’t fit right on an episodic show. Its two properties of world-building that don’t really coincide perfectly and because of this, Mushishi comes across as far from perfect in this facet. The structure of Mushishi might’ve taken it took into a slight nose-dive, but there’s one true detail to the show that makes up for it, the atmosphere.\
In order to succeed in developing a relaxed tone, the atmosphere has to be just right for the viewer to be engrossed in it for which there’s plenty to go around in Mushishi. One other crucial detail that every person always mentions about Mushishi that comes from the melancholic atmosphere, is that there’s not one person who finds the atmosphere nothing but beautiful. It’s hard to make an atmosphere that is faulty but the one thing that would make it a disservice to any show of Mushishi’s nature is how poor it creates a mood that is too blatantly lifeless or absolutely monotonous in how it integrates with the tone to which I applaud Mushishi for bringing itself to its knees and flourishing. The lack of a lot of music actually helps in this aspect a lot in order to let us breathe in the atmosphere without any distraction for long periods of time while looking at the great artistry of the scene in question. In fact, I would’ve appreciated even more if there was no music at all since the random musical instrumentation spread out at certain points of the episodes don’t feel like they were needed at all.\
With something as slow and methodical as shows like Mushishi typically come across, Mushishi manages to pace itself near-perfectly in taking its time to let us take in the scenes at face-value without hinging on quick interludes that would hamper on every scene. Yet, despite its slow pacing, it never feels like a slog to go through. It’s like listening to really good drone/ambient album that goes on for 2 hours and once it’s done, you’ve felt as though only mere minutes have passed because of how entranced you were from the experience. That is one thing to describe Mushishi: Entrancing. Once you’ve set your sights and overall attention to the subtle details put into, not only the art, but how hypnotic the writing of the dialogue is and the amazing Mushi sequences are, you just can’t take your eyes off of it for one minute.\
Great care is given to the tone of Mushishi as it builds up the tone at certain points to feel very compelling and strong on a mental and emotional level into the stories. The Mushi sequences alone are all extremely breathtaking to experience because of their lucid creativity and imagination that was put into practice by the brilliant artistry of the show. They’re the types of sequences that will forever be burrowed into your memory just by the sheer awe-inspiring imagination that was obviously inspired by Japanese folklore with the designs of the Mushis themselves and how the sequences themselves were directed brilliantly by how tense and uneasy they were portrayed whenever they appeared on-screen or any of the mushi incidents.\
The artwork itself borrows heavily from influences of old Japanese artistry you’d see on an old Ukiyo-e print from early 17th Century Japan. It gives the atmosphere a much added bonus from the wonderfully detailed backgrounds and the creative animation of the sequences I mentioned beforehand. There’s not much in the way of overall breathtaking animation because of its very slow nature but it doesn’t do a disservice since it fits very well to the tone. The character designs themselves look like actual human beings and have very minimal detail to the foreground of the palette on-screen.\
Mushishi is a show that cannot be done justice by just talking about it and that you have to experience it for yourself to see the qualities come full force. It certainly did for me. Despite my thoughts on it not being perfect in how I view on all of its positive aspects, that shouldn’t be a clear sign to not go through a genuine calming experience that you’ll hardly ever see in most anime. Watch it before you go to bed or anything that has to do with trying to make you reach into a state of tranquility. It should prove worthy of any acclaim to people who’ve been interested in the pure Japanese mythology that this series has created for itself. If there should be an anime show that could rank along with “The Great Wave off Kanagawa” as one of the most important contribution to Japanese art that showcases its aesthetic insight to its own culture, Mushishi would be that anime, bar none.\

     A compelling, mysterious and thought-provoking anime on being's known as Mushi. This unique show proves that an anime doesn't need to have romance, action, comedy or something thrilling to be interesting to watch.\
Mushishi is comprised of a bunch of episodic adventures where each episode follows its own mini story of, Ginko's encounters with the natural phenomenon known as Mushi. Each heartfelt episode manages to cleverly bring a great deal of drama involving different types of Mushi, with different problems, and there are episodes that stand out from the rest. It's pretty unique how this anime is set out like 26 different Japanese folktales, which\
          \
        is a welcome change from the usual anime.\
Having every episode telling a different story there's always something new to expect however this also means that there are new characters to every episode. With only Ginko being the only character to appear throughout the series it's pretty hard to get emotionally attached to any of them but at least they make the most out of the time they have.\
Mushishi has some superb animation, which successfully makes the most out of the earth look and colors. So much detail is put into the environment; water and ambient lighting that even the slightly dull premise of the show can be easily overlooked. The music is a tranquil selection of guitar and age-old Japanese tunes that suit the calm nature of the show. Both the animation and music are the aspects that allow the viewer to be immersed into this deeply, compelling show.\
Overall Mushishi is a pretty amazing anime, with no beginning or end but just a collection of adventurous stories. It manages to bring something new to the saturated anime market, without any use of gimmicks. With all that said the only real reason why I didn't rate this any higher was due to the lack of everything; apart from adventure, mystery and storytelling. So this show really isn't suitable for people who require action, romance or anything thrilling in their shows, because Mushishi is really something that you can kick back and relax to.\

    Mushishi is, to tell the truth, nothing very special. It doesn't try to stand out, nor does it feed us with anime standards, like moe, or fanservice. it doesn't have flashy action - hardly any at all in fact - nor has it excessive amounts of blood. In fact this in itself is what makes it stand up. Its tranquility and taking things at a calm pace is what makes Mushishi so great, yet in a way it is also what makes it a bit offputting to some.\
Setting-wise, Mushishi is set in a world where being not human nor animal live. They are basic, pure;\
          \
        in touch with the very essence of life. They are called Mushi, as they are called, are often capable of performing supernatural phenomena, and naturally enough there are humans devoted to the study of Mushi. They are called Mushishi, and Mushishi follows one of these, uh, Mushishi. Eh.\
Mushishi doesn't have a continuous story, rather, each episode features its own small story, where Ginko, our Mushishi, encounters a new Mushi and the problems it causes for some humans. The two-three episode characters are usually portrayed very meticulously to the viewer, giving us decent enough information and emotion to make them realistic, an impressive feat considering they have around twenty minutes to expose them to us. Usually Ginko tries to help with his knowledge (and to gain more), but at this point Ginko is really set apart from the standard hero, becoming more of an antihero-type of person. Whereas most heroes would never give up and go all superdetermined, Ginko knows when enough is enough, and if he can't do anything more, or if it's pointless, he tells everyone that it is, and leaves. In that, Ginko, too, fits in with the calm of Mushishi; he never lets his emotions rule over his sense of reason; he knows when to stop.\
Accompanying this lovely setting is what most will probably remember Mushishi for: Its art. The landscapes and sceneries protrayed often - Mushishi takes place in natural/village environemnts only - are breathtaking. Yet, they are not extremely vivid; they don't hit your senses with avid coloring and all that. No; they are more pale, plain. While still procuring those memorable sceneries, this also allows it to induce a more peaceful expeirence.\
The soundtrack must of course not be left out, because that, too, plays a major part in Mushishi's calmness. The soundtrack usually bases itself on a single melliflous intstrumental theme for each episode, which plays throughout the episode and at the end credits. the opening song is also lovely, and as serene as the rest of the soundtrack, and the show as a whole. The voice actors, too, do a great job of keeping with the peaceful feeling of Mushishi. They have very calm voices, and even when upset, screaming or crying, it's not in-your-face or loud; it's calm, yet very evocative.\
Though, all this tranquility, while important for the overall feel of Mushishi, can also be the most deterring aspect of it. Simply because it's a tad boring. You don't really watch Mushishi for its entertainment value, which in and of itself isn't very high. It can be rather boring. However, that doesn't change the fact that it is a show you should try out at least once. Or twice. What Mushishi is best at is calming you down, letting you relax with some interesting paranormal mysteries and enjoying gorgeous vistas.\

    I heard about this anime a while ago, but the synopsis didn't seem that appealing to me.  So I basically forgot about it until recently and decided to watch a few episodes to see why it was so well regarded...\
It's beautiful.  It's like meditating.\
Story:  It's an episodic show that feels like a collection of fables or myths to me... almost as though these stories were from a world before science when people made up spirits or gods to explain life's mysteries.  That's not really the premise of the show, but that's how it felt to me.\
It's laid-back and meditative.  But\
          \
        I was riveted ...maybe because it is such a quiet sort of show, I'm not sure.  Absolutely riveted.  I didn't want to blink.  I wanted to see everything and soak it all in.  I think it's astonishing that something that lacking in tension is still that incredibly compelling.  It's kind of like when you see the Grand Canyon or sequoias for the first time, I guess. ;)\
Art:  The world is beautiful.  The people are all the same, except Ginko. ;)  They only bothered to draw, like, 4 different faces (or it just felt that way)... so just keep in mind that even though that woman in one episode looks just like the woman from that other episode... it's most likely not the same person -- just let it go. ;)  \
I thought the gorgeousness of the scenery more than made up for the lack of distinction in the humans.  And I also thought that there was a subtle message about the universality of experience and the concept of the 'every man/woman' in the uniformity of the way the people looked (which is also, I think, related to the lack of time in the show -- it doesn't matter if this is a century ago or today, and the story doesn't tell you).  And the landscapes are amazing.  I thought they did an incredible job of giving the environment the right feel and mood for the episodes.  There's so much personality in the environment that you could make an argument about how the landscape and the mushishi are the characters and the people are the background.\
Sound:  I thought the voice actors did a great job of expressing a wide range of emotions without going to extremes.  There's a mellowness and evenness to the show that's recreated even in the tone and pitch of their voices, which I really liked.  (I really love it when everything comes together like that.)  \
Character:  Like I mentioned before, you end up feeling as though the main character the world/nature and the people are just what trees and buildings are normally in other stories, which brings art and character closer than I've ever seen before.  Ginko is practically the only character you see in more than one episode and serves as a main character/guide/wise man/shaman during your exploration of this new world.  The experience of the show is the experience of his relationship with the world around him.  He is poised, calm and interested without being over-eager or overbearing.  There is such a strong sense of serenity and acceptance in Ginko and his attitude towards the world around him.  He makes you think of a time long lost where man co-existed with nature instead of destroying it.  And because of that he&rsquo;s soothing and comforting to watch.\
Enjoyment:  There is this wonderful, reverent serenity that permeates everything about the series: the lingering look at the landscapes; the semi-monotonous speech of the characters; the slow, deliberate pacing of each show; and, most especially, Ginko's quiet, unflappable calm.  All those elements help create this atmosphere of profound stillness and ease. I feel like I walked away from each episode somehow refreshed and rejuvenated. And I loved how everything in the series was fell in line with the theme.  It's not uncommon for the story and the characters to carry a show, but here the sound and the art are just as essential to conveying ideas and emotions to the viewer.  Like I mentioned before, I love it when everything points in the same direction and there's nothing superfluous tacked on to interfere with or dilute the message.  Brilliant.\
This isn't for people with a short attention span, probably.  I'm sure there's a big chunk of the population will find it boring as watching grass grow and that's fine; it isn't for everyone.  But if you'd like to take a deep breath once in a while... this is definitely worth checking out.\

 The Story… \
It tells about different tales that involves paranormal phenomena, phenomenon that has something to do with a so-called ‘mushi’. The story is about the expedition of a Mushishi named Ginko, whose expertise is on paranormal phenomena. On his journey he encounters various phenomena that have something to do about his expertise, making it as a part of his living, or a threat with uncertified safety. \
The main attraction would be supernatural and mystery of the story. It consists of long, serious and mind-boggling monologues that will never come up to boredom though it will surely hook to your senses.\
          \
        The way it attracts is through curiosity, curiosity that pushes you to find out what is the mystery behind it. It may be repetitive in such a way though the series make a difference to attract viewers as they fill tension to its drama and putting like a detective case through its mystery. \
The other uniqueness in this series is that there is no main plot though it only consists of short tales that will keep you accompany on not being bored. With this method even though you didn’t watched the first episode you will get the hang of the second episode, so that means in every episode there’s a twist and tale to tell.\
Art & Animation…\
All is good in art & animation. The backgrounds, the scenery, the people, other minor details, and even the OP and ED are all beautiful. The other characters are drawn in such a mysterious way and somewhat have identical figures that you may notice on their faces. They are drawn and animated based on each tale, faces and gestures that brings different feelings to it.\
Sound…\
A deep, calm, and soothing sounds and music will come up to your ears. Instrumentals that will surely bring harmonious melody that match to the era of the story. OP song that make the series something old but it’s perfectly match and nice to hear. ED that gives creeps though it also has nice sound and it’s related to its era.\
Character…\
One impression about the protagonist, Ginko, is that he’s not boring to watch even though he always appears on each episode. He’s an awesome guy who faces trials on his own way and he’s also a compassionate type whose life contains mysteries. And even though he’s quite a hardheaded, when it comes to his expertise he’s willing to help as soon as there’s a limitation on it. He’s living wanderer/doctor who seeks others assistance and to know the depths between mushi and human beings. \
Enjoyment…\
The enjoyment takes on how Ginko surpass all the troubles and mystery behind the mushi and as a mushishi. All went well, because it’s composed of a nice story, good quality art & animation design, soothing and matching sounds, and characters that show the phenomenon effects. It’s a unique kind of anime in short. \
Overall…\
Even though the theme is kind of old, still it’s quite a refreshing anime to watch, a definitely must not missed anime. 10/10 overall…\

    Mushishi was painful. I have never fancied that a day will come when I will drop a show, but alas, this day came. Mushishi is my first dropped show, and for a solid reason.\
First off, the story is non-existent. The characters have no motivation, and I have no idea where the show is supposed to go, even after watching 14 episodes of it. Hell, even the most generic shounen characters have some goal to pursue, be it to save the world, or to find something. The characters in Mushishi lack this precious substance.\
Second, the art and animation weren't anything special. Before trying to watch Mushishi,\
          \
        I've heard people say that it has magnificent art and animation - my foot! I watched HunterxHunter a week ago, and it had a way better animation for its 148 episodes than this wreck, Mushishi. In addition, half of the characters in Mushishi looked the same, and there were moments when I didn't realize I was seeing a totally different character from the one I had seen in the previous episode (or even scene).\
The sound was boring at best. Most of the OST lacked lyrics, which is a disadvantage to me. The Opening, which was the only piece with lyrics, which was dull and almost made me fall asleep. I can say nothing about the VAs, neither good or bad - they didn't need to do a spectacular job whatsoever.\
The characters were the worst aspect of Mushishi. As I already mentioned in the beginning, they all lacked motivations and goals, and wandered aimlessly throughout the story. Needless to say, no character managed to interest me, because of their monotonous behaviour - yes, almost all characters had the same personalities.\
I didn't enjoy Mushishi and I'm not planning to ever finish it. And, please, don't tell me that it gets better in the later episodes - a good show is good from the beginning to the end.\
Disappointed. Might watch To Love Ru instead - it may provide me with something substantial, unlike Mushishi.\

    Overview:\
Mushi-Shi is a a very unique series about microscopic mystical creatures called the \"Mushi\" and a man named Ginko that goes around studying them and helping people with Mushi related problems. Mushi-Shi tries very hard to be an artistic and sophisticated series and many hail it as a masterpiece. Whether or not it meets that criteria in your book of course depends on your answer to that eternal question of aesthetics, \"What is Art?\".\
Plot: 7/10\
The Mushi are said to be much simpler than bacteria or even viruses, but have intelligence and are sometimes able to take human form. In the first episode, a woman is\
          \
        asked to become a mushi herself at the behest of several mushi. The mushi often grant people magical powers, but more often than not act as a serious detriment and are technically parasites. Ginko is quick to explain though that the mushi aren't actually evil or malevolent. They are simply trying to survive. The Mushi exist between the worlds of the living and the dead and have magical properties. On the surface, the Mushi share many traits with the mediclorians from the Star Wars prequels. Interestingly enough, the Mushi-Shi manga was first published in 1999 only a few months after the release of The Phantom Menace, where mediclorians are first discussed. The story structure is purely episodic with Ginko treating Mushi problems. At times, it almost takes on the atmosphere of a medical drama , like a very metaphysical  House episode directed by David Lynch. Sometimes Mushi-Shi lightly touches on societal issues like family structure, loyalty, and child abandonment. However, Mushi-Shi prefers to raise questions rather than answer them. My first impression of Mushi-Shi was that the mediclorians from Star Wars had somehow invaded an Anton Chekhov short story. This actually isn't that far off in terms of its writing style, by which I mean a completely neutral author voice combined with an almost non-existent plot that basically just flows freely to create a \"daily life\" feel with everyday characters...only with magic bacteria! \
Characters: 8/10\
Due to the episodic nature of the show, the only character with development is Ginko. Ginko is by the way one of the oldest plant species in existence, and the character studies what are supposedly the oldest organisms. Now that the pun has been explained, lets talk about our man. Ginko is calm, calculating, and never seems frightened or shocked by anything that happens. He is an ideal doctor and someone that can work under any kind of pressure. Ginko is very laid back and displays no signs of anger, excitement, hatred, or joy. He is just very mellow all the time. He chain smokes in every episode and I don't think its tobacco. Of course, If I was the equivalent of an ER surgeon/ exorcist, I would probably go through life high as well.\
Art: 9/10\
The art is Mushi-Shi is absolutely gorgeous and is probably the highlight of the entire series. Every scene is this anime is beautiful. Sometimes it is haunting and even mildly disturbing, but most often it is serene beauty that we view in Mushi-Shi\
Soundtrack 8/10\
The soundtrack fits the mood of the series quite well and has an opening that is quite catchy (although very hipster indy pop). This is a very hipster series though, so honestly did you expect anything else?\
Enjoyment: 7/10\
Mushi-Shi can at times be gorgeous, thought provoking, and appear like an artistic masterpiece. At other times it can be insufferably slow and so pretentious I want to kick the writer's ass. Mushi-Shi is not for everyone, but it is a well done series and I think most people will at least get something out of it. I will give Mushi-Shi praise for having no instances of \"moe\" bullshit, fanservice, hyper violence, giant robots, or other anime cliche's. However, does that alone make it a masterpiece? Not really. That isn't to say many people won't love Mushi-Shi. I thought it was good, but it wasn't really my cup of tea. I actually like it when a story has concrete conflict and an observable purpose. I like it when the author puts forward their own opinions, so I can compare and contrast them with my own. Mushi-Shi has a very neutral author voice and is very light on plot and action. This is one reason I compared the way the mangaka tries to write to the style of Anton Chekhov. I am much more of a Dostoevsky and Tolstoy fan personally. I also prefer the films of Hitchcock and Fritz Lang to those Cronenberg and Lynch. This is simply my opinion. If you absolutely adored Eraserhead and Uncle Vanya is your homeboy, I would check out Mushi-Shi.\
\
Overall 8/10\
\
I actually didn't love this series the first time I watched it, but it has grown on me a bit. I may not be quite as huge a Mushi fan as so many other critics on  MAL, but it is a series worthy of respect. The art is amazing, the soundtrack is well done, and it tries to go in a radically new direction for modern anime. The main character was interesting, and moments of the show were truly quite good. Ergo Proxy is probably the series that is closest to Mushi-shi, but Ergo Proxy is more in your face confusing and repeatedly tries to rape your mind. Mushi-shi is a much more calm and in ways more sophisticated anime than Ergo Proxy. Although perhaps sophisticated isn't really the right word. I think I would rather say that they are simply different.\

    In the past science was still unknown, thus whenever an incomprehensible phenomenon happened, humanity attributed these incidents to supernatural occurrences. In the west gods were the main explanation, whereas in the east, particularly in Japan, such events were mainly tied to spirits and demons. There are quite a few anime that present such themes as Mononoke or Natsume Yuujinchou, yet in the case of Mushishi, it presents these topics through \"creatures\" called \"mushi\". Mushishi is a fantastic anime that displays these themes wonderfully trough a compelling narrative and presentation of the story, as well as wonderful character presentation.\
~Story~\
Mushishi follows the main protagonist Ginko, a mushi-shi\
          \
        or mushi researcher, who travels from one place to other in order to investigate the mushi. These are considered to be the most basic life forms of the world, including to be tied to the explanation or meaning of life itself; yet almost no information exists of these, as most people are unable to see them. Nevertheless, some people are aware of their existence, making the mushi-shi's job to investigate easier, as these may harm humanity as well; however, Mushishi's intention is to transmit the fact that mushi are neutral beings. It incorporates them as natural things that coexist with other life forms, different from other mediums where usually it is the root of \"evil\" as it disadvantages humanity, and thus needs to be exterminated.\
The anime is of episodic nature, yet does an outstanding job when it comes to narrating and presenting the story. The mystery buildup of each event is well done, by carefully introducing the viewer the circumstance of the village/people affected without revealing more than necessary to later unravel how everything happened and is solved. These incidents are varied, yet very human and realistic, at times being even a bit disturbing. \
Another positive aspect of Mushishi's episodic nature is the fact that each episode gives an insight on what mushi are, their variety, behaviour and habitat, as well as shaping the world and people in that era; besides, mushi seem to have a foundation in both science and fables, in which viewers may recognize some phenomenons in real world where the author decided to explain these through. As the show progresses, viewers may begin to appreciate it even more, as each situation is always different and leaves the audience wondering what is to be expected next.\
~Characters~\
Ginko is certainly is one of the most interesting characters in the anime scene. He is of benevolent nature, yet mixed with common sense and his own knowledge of the mushi, which consequently in some cases he may come over as a harsh individual. This is due to his conceptions and beliefs of life itself, which naturally includes mushi as well; in his eyes every type of life form is equal and should be respected. Some background story to Ginko is provided, yet is scarce, which leaves the viewer longing for more, but it doesn't influence the story in any negative way.\
There is no big cast of characters in Mushishi; in fact, Ginko is the only character that is present in every single episode.This doesn't mean that the supporting cast is dull and underdeveloped; these are very human and outstandingly well presented; in fact, you really begin to care and relate to the characters throughout the episodes, because of their struggle, the human decisions and hardships they have to endure. Other thing to note is that cast are not stereotypical in any way, they're simply persons with problems. There are the interactions of Ginko with the villagers, which could be described as a scientist who comes to explain to people who posses no knowledge on the subject, which is quite intriguing to see.\
~Animation and sound~\
The animation quality of Mushishi is well done, character's movement are realistic and well executed, as well as the scenery such as trees, clouds, rain and snow. The backgrounds are nothing outstanding, yet varied, well displayed and detailed, matching correctly with the atmosphere it is trying to convey. Character designs are nevertheless a minor drawback, as most are nearly indistinguishable from each other, yet fulfill their purpose. Nevertheless, it also avoids the issue of judging the characters by their appearance, enhancing the general atmosphere of the anime.\
The voice actors performed their role well, though nothing remarkable.The soundtrack used is simple, yet matched perfectly with the narrative and presentation of it, negating usage of any type of soundtrack when needed; rustling of leaves, conversations, which added to the general atmosphere it was trying to convey, some of them being very memorable. There is however a certain lack in variety of these, consequently hindering the viewer from fully enjoying the show.\
~Enjoyment~\
Overall Mushishi was a wonderful anime; it is an experience everyone should have had, it is a journey into the world of the mushi, based on science and fables at the same time. In addition to the fantastic narrative and execution of it, characters, soundtracks and animation used matched perfectly with the anime. I'd love to have seen more background story on the main protagonist, yet was easily overlookable. This anime is a must watch for anyone interested in the supernatural exploration, sharing similarities with Natsume Yuujinchou, yet more intricate. It is a series best watched when not marathoned.\

    It’s very nice that Mushishi had showed a great way of enjoying such scenery, environment, and culture of each passing scene as you might find yourself exploring its wonders and deeper meaning of it, which the series proves when you’re into this world. Starting with its bunch of supernatural and mystery that engulfs the whole series, it never crossed to my mind that it is dull, boring, typical, and all used up theme just like the others, thus, it has shown such different mixture of drama, tension, and unusual phenomenon that will surely be a factor why this show is worthy to be watched\
Now that\
          \
        you’re getting into the world of this show, expect some unusual sights that are being focused and centered all throughout the series. This is where there are such unexpected scenes to be seen and felt which will give a marvelous reaction to the viewers. In its beginning, it is quite enticing to find out what is hidden behind all of this creatures and how this creatures affects the movement of the show.\
Starting with the protagonist, a wanderer who seems fond with these kinds of things will bring the show to the extent that his purpose is not only seeing the creature itself but also to find out what drags their existence in the human world. This is where the mystery and solving out problems pops out that became truly entertaining, as they come up a variety of ideas in every episode, which they’re trying to show its different presence of drama, tension, and the unusual parts that keeps you wondering about. \
Mushishi isn’t only just a story based series that tackles about the unknown spectacles but it is also great in terms of describing a refreshing outlook for its viewers to enjoy. Honestly, all I can say to the series is that it’s great, complete, and bizarre in showing such wonderful art & designs that makes me be amazed into it. Using such sketchy, brilliant, and light colors really affects the view into the show, as it sometimes gives a deeper meaning and interpretation for the viewers to look on, which I myself am also amazed on how these things turns out. Overall, these kinds of designs and themes that putted into the show truly match to the story, environment, and its surroundings as a whole.\
Similar to the designs, the sounds will never been left behind as this element also gave a plus factor to the show. It’s just like the classical sounds where old instruments are being played. OP and ED theme is played with such soothing sounds, while the BG effects have the same view just like the OP and ED as both of them gives a strange feeling into the show.\
One thing to impress into these 26 episode series is that why the protagonist isn’t boring to watch. Mainly because the reason behind it is just merely simple, while appearing with all these 26 episodes the characteristic of this man is just unexpectedly many where he can be serious at some times while making such a fuss one after another. Even though this protagonist faces many trials, he is ready to face it without any doubts, which he became a guy with an attitude not to be easily forgotten.\
Ginko, the name of the protagonist, is seems simple enough just like an ordinary wanderer but with his kind of different expertise he instantly became different from the others. What I like to this guy is that he thinks sharp, reasonable, and quick at some times but when pressure comes from his back, he sometimes became reckless. Sometimes there are twisted thoughts comes from my mind just because of his acts and thought about the flow of the show, so in every episode I’ve thought that this character wouldn’t be that great without his genius and well reasoning.\
Why watch Mushishi? Because when you’re really fond of sightseeing and exploring such unknown phenomenon or maybe such other things, this is truly one of a kind show that have shown all its aspects in their matched and beautiful outlook. Overall, trying to find a different genre which shows a pleasant and peaceful pacing? Why not try this and be amazed to it.\

    Story - The anime has a rather simple story that is Ginko a mushi-shi travels to various parts helping people who have problems with creatures called mushi which are somewhat of a combination of plant/nature/animal. Each episode is a different story about Ginko helping people and there is no real ongoing plot. The main problem I had with the story is that they get very repetitive and about half way through the anime I had to take a break because I felt I was just rewatching the same episodes over again. A large portion of the episodes are about a woman and a man and\
          \
        one of them has disease or problem and tries to tie in a love into the problem which gets tiring after a while. This being said I did think the last five to six episodes were good. If you can stand repetitive plot lines then this should not bother you much.\
Art &ndash; There are two parts to the art here. First is the nature and drawings of the mushi. This was well done and fit into the series and was one of the better parts as well. The major flaw in the art style is that the minor characters look all very similar I honestly could not tell much difference between them. I though that they just got lazy, and only changed the hair style of the characters to make distinctions between the minor characters. All in all the art style was alright.\
Sound &ndash; There was nothing really outstanding about the sound that comes to mind. There were no real problems with the sound either. Over all the sound was pretty good and there is not much to talk about.\
Character &ndash; As I have said before I found it hard to distinguish the characters from each other. As for the character of the anime I did enjoy the fact that it was willing to take a different view for anime. The problem was that they could not make it different enough for me to get too into the anime.\
Enjoyment &ndash; If you could not figure it out yet I did not enjoy this anime. One of the main reasons for this was the fact that all the comments had said it was great or amazing and I was sadly disappointed. Another main reason was that I felt the lack of the anime making you want to see the next episode. Mushi-shi did not present much as to one wandering what will be next as most of the episodes ended similarly. I will say that if you are looking for something different and have not seen any anime about the relationship between people and nature that you would enjoy this anime. \
Overall &ndash; Overall I have seen better anime but I have also seen worse anime. I gave Mushi-shi a six only because of the lack of enjoyment and I felt I was suffering through watching it. I did how ever enjoy several of the last episodes as it attempted to recapture my interest. My last words if you are looking for something different in anime this might be worth checking out. ",

    If there's one thing you can say about this show, it's certainly unique. But this show is one of those ones that are kind of hard to rate, because it's really not for everybody. I personally enjoyed it but I could very easily see someone else getting bored out of their mind by it. Might as well get started then.\
When you watch this show, the most obvious thing that will pop out is the atmosphere itself. Taking place in *gasp* Japan in... I don't know shit about Japan's time periods but either way it's not modern. It takes place in a time where the resident's\
          \
        interactions with nature are more you know, relevant. A time where people didn't have big modern cities or advanced medicine or anything like that. This is a time where people are forced to directly live off of and be at the mercy of nature to survive. In many ways, this makes the setting and time period practically perfect. As our protagonist, Ginko, wanders around the countryside we see a good variety of settings, all of which can be almost equally beautiful. Quite frankly, the art and the atmosphere are pretty much the best I've seen in any anime I have ever watched. It's great, it really is, especially when it comes to the designs of the mushi.\
The thing is, even though this show focuses heavily on nature and the spiritual sides of things (well, I guess I wouldn't exactly call Mushi spirits but that's not important right now) some of the events, concepts, and ideas presented in the show are still very much relevant to us today. This show is completely episodic, but some of the individual episodes actually end up covering some pretty heavy topics. The show can really make you think some times, which is another thing that I like about it.\
Still, that's not to say the show isn't without its faults. Whether these issues are actually a big deal to you is going to make all the difference between whether you enjoy the show or not. If those issues don't bother you, this show is probably going to be one of the absolute greatest shows you'll ever watch. If they are problematic, than this show might end up being a bit boring to you. In which case, I suggest you might want to just watch a few episodes and then drop it (you can basically watch the episodes in any order by the way. I personally think episode 21 is a really nice one by the way.) \
So what are those issues? Well, one of them is simply the lay out of the show. Ginko is a wanderer, going from place to place... and he can't stay in one place for long. This is central to his character, and fortunately it's explained pretty decently why he's actually like this... as opposed to \"wanderers will be wanderers. Loners will be loners.\" Like you might see some shows say xP What does this translate to? Well, it's a completely episodic anime, with no overbearing plot to any of it. It's literally just the guy going from place to place trying to help people that have problems pertaining to mushi. In a similar fashion to crime shows like CSI or whatever, it might end up feeling a bit repetitive after a while. There are plenty of recurring themes, and it doesn't help that some of the side characters look ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME. The show can be monotonous at times, so if you don't like shows that follow this sort of format in general, you might not like it too much. I personally wouldn't call this a flaw as much as it's simply a format that some would find appealing and some wouldn't. Though I will admit it would've been nice if the show at least attempted to have some sort of plot that brought the episodes together.\
The only other thing I think is worth mentioning is the characters. The thing is, there's really only one character worth mentioning, and that's Ginko. Everybody else is pretty much gone after they're episode is over. So I guess I'll talk about Ginko first. As a protagonist, Ginko seems like a good fit for the show. He's designed in a way that makes him more modern looking than anyone else in the show. Apparently they originally intended the show to be more modern... and changed that... but kept Ginko's design. However I'm not entirely sure about the source on that so if I'm wrong don't lynch me. Either way, he's actually a surprisingly bad ass character. I am a person who likes character development, so it's a bit of a disappointment that Ginko didn't get more of it. His backstory is actually pretty interesting in a way but it basically only answers the most basic questions you have about the character. Still I can say that I enjoy his character.\
Every other character on the other hand only gets an episode of development so it's challenging at times to get invested in them. But for what they got in the time frame, some of their stories can actually hit surprisingly hard. Not as hard as they would if we got to know them better instead of just one 20 minute episode but still heavy nonetheless. The characters are a lot more realistic and toned down then you would expect from an anime. This is a positive thing to me especially if you want to take a break from... well, almost every anime ever. Still, this could be a good or a bad thing depending on how you look at it. One of the main reasons this show can feel so repetitious is because the side characters aren't really all that distinguished from one another. They're all unique in some way, but because they're *mostly* just pretty normal people reacting to abnormal situations they don't really distinguish themselves that much. \
This is made even worse because of the way they're drawn. This is the only reason I give the art a 9 instead of a 10, the side characters all look way too similar. In most anime you'll see different hair colors (many of which won't be realistic at all), different hairstyles (many of which won't be realistic AT ALL), different clothing (except for you know, most high school animes) etc. This show really highlights why somewhat unrealistic but varied characters designs are actually a good thing a good portion of the time. Yes, they all look like actual Japanese people in that time period. But seriously, some of those character designs look almost exactly the same. You'll see a decent amount of young couples throughout this series, and it's almost impossible to tell them apart design wise some times other than say, the hair length of the girl. The characters are just that similar looking. \
So yeah, that's the show. I personally enjoyed it, but this is one of those shows that are kind of hard to judge. It's just the kind of show that will be completely amazing to some viewers and a complete snooze-fest for others. It's a nice slow paced atmospheric anime, and it also has one of the most relaxing theme songs I've ever heard. So if you don't have a tolerance for a slow pace or a little repetitiveness then this might not be for you. You might want to just watch the first few episodes, a couple of other random episodes and then drop it. Or you could watch the whole thing. The show's not for everyone, but for anybody who thinks they have the patience to watch a sort of laid back show like this then give it a try. It's an interesting show, it really is.\

    The brisk night breeze cuts your face as you trudge through the fresh, powdery snow. You glance upwards to the tranquil, star laden canvas in the sky, wondering just how long you've been traveling. There's a rustling of thicket, seemingly blanketing the woods around you, and a distant echo of howling, vibrating your frigid bones. At last you see the cabin, your eventual destination. Squinting through the bramble of branches in your field of view, the shack has a small stream of smoke billowing into the crisp, clear air. There's a dim glow of a fire inside the window, causing them to produce condensation and\
          \
        steam up. Suddenly, an ominous aura comes over your body, causing you to halt and you confirm that this is your target. A mushi, more menacing and intriguing than any you've combatted before. Consumed with curiosity and caution, you resumed your trek to the cabin.\
Mushishi, adapted by Studio Artland (LotGH) in 2005, is one of the most unique and fascinating anime I have ever seen. Viewers follow Ginko, a “mushi-shi”, through an almost documentarian style series, with an amicable yet languid atmosphere. He travels across vibrant landscapes in search of “mushi”, who are transient beings exhibiting a plethora of unique abilities. Through his journeys, Ginko wishes to uncover the true nature of these creatures, and perhaps develop a more coherent understand of human existence itself.\
Mushishi is a hard anime to recommend. If you don't watch it properly (i.e., no bingeing here) or with the right mindset, it can fall off and become boring. The anime is less of a standard beginning, middle and end and more of an experience. That being said, it's best enjoyed in small doses with the lights off in order to really feel the ambient nature the series exudes. The way each vignette is handled makes the anime episodic in structure, which can be less than translatable for some viewers. The ending of Mushishi is also much more like your standard episode instead of a conclusion, leaving much room for a sequel… which we all know happened some years later.\
The lack of recurring characters can also cause the series to seem emotionally disconnected. It's hard to empathize with one-offs with little to no development but in a way this adds to the impassiveness the series embodies. The effort is directed to the mushi and the environment more than the individual affected, which is what I believe the show’s creator was trying to get across. Ginko himself is an enigmatic character. He represents the ponderer in all of us, and as if stricken by his own curiosity he actively seeks out the mushi to learn more about them. His calm, collected demeanor resonates with the audience, causing you to really root for him and support his campaign. \
The mushi themselves are enchanting in their own right. Whether possessing a human or a plant, they have a sentient nature about them that's enthralling. Each time I would sit down to watch Mushishi I found myself excited to see what new mushi would be revealed in the episode. Some of the imagery the mushi produced when being exercised were quite disturbing and in some cases even graphic, adding to the haunting setting.\
The amount of themes explored in Mushishi can seem overwhelming, since the mushi themselves are so unexplainable. Some say the series is illustrating the roots of mankind while others tend to draw more to a biblical demonry reference. Either way you slice it, Mushishi is one of those few shows that falls under the intellectually challenging category without being pretentious. Truly a remarkably interesting series.\
The art in Mushishi has a very dark tone to it. Although there are instances of vivid color schemes being explored, most of the scenes are washed out or almost opaque. Again, this aspect causes the languid nature of the series to be emphasized greatly. Most of the episode characters have indistinguishable faces, which doesn't help the empathizing point I made earlier, but helps bring out the other parts of the show more clearly. Animation is solid but not flashy in any way. I don't believe the series had an extreme budget, and it shows in some ways. The mid 2000’s was an experimentation period for animators after all, and Mushishi is thankful enough not to incorporate any sluggish CGI.\
The “Sore Feet Song” is one of the oddest anime OPs I can think of. Its slow acoustic rhythm is anything but exciting, but really sets the tone of the show. As much as I couldn't get into it originally, by the end of the series I began to sit through it instead of skipping over it. The full version of the song is also quite soothing. The ED is delicate and light, wrapping a nice bow on top of each episode, which is another reason why Mushishi is great to watch in small doses. Although the composer of the OST did work on shows like Excel Saga, Mushishi’s Soundtrack is impeccably relaxing. The soft strings and pianissimo beats draw out the best in each scene. Both the English and Japanese dubs are well done and don't detract from the atmosphere of the show.\
My large amount of enjoyment from Mushishi was mostly due to my ability to take it slow. I recognize that this show is not for everyone, but if watched in the right setting and with an open mind, it can truly be a delightful experience. It doesn't fall under a specific genre so it's hard to compare to other shows. Mushishi is just Mushishi. I would recommend this series to fans of shows like Haibane Renmei or Kino’s Journey due to their world building alone, and for the latter it's episodic approach. As always, thanks for reading!\

    If there's one thing that I've learned after all my time here on MAL, it's that filthy casuals and critics are one and the same. Both groups are prone to overrating and underrating various programmes and ignoring flaws in their favourite shows whilst discussing them. The sole difference lies in the programmes that these two groups watch... oh, and the fact that it would seem people put more sway into a critic's opinion than a filthy casual's and why wouldn't that be the case? Critics are the ones that know what's good and what's rubbish, right? Not exactly. When you get right down to it,\
          \
        all shows have their strengths and shortcomings and what is good and what's rubbish is ultimately left to the viewer to decide. With all of that said, let's get on with this review. Today, we're looking at Mushishi: one of MAL's most precious critical gems that I don't particularly care much for.\
We all know about Mushishi: it's an episodic supernatural drama about a wandering shaman who does exorcisms. Each episode follows a rather formulaic approach: we have a person who's being plagued by spirits, our shaman comes to the rescue by performing an exorcism, then leaves to wander the earth some more. Argue all you want about semantics but that's the basic plot and formula that the show follows over the course of 26 episodes. Now this approach has a lot that's going for it. I mean, Western programmes pretty much rely on an episodic format so it must do *something* right. Since each episode is a self-contained story, you can (quite literally) watch this show in any order you wish. Even though each episode follows a formulaic approach, what goes down in every episode is something to behold. There's something inexplicably mystifying about the way that the mushi affect the lives of others along with how Ginko resolves the problems that people have because of the mushi.\
Inexplicable mystification aside, the episodic format lends itself to one problem that all shows of its ilk tend to have: consistency with episode quality. Given that every episode in a particular show is NOT written by the same person, it's only natural that some episodes would be much more entertaining to watch than others. Whilst this problem affects all programmes, this dilemma is especially noticeable in episodic shows. Even if a particular episode in a show with an overarching story is lacklustre, at least it contributes *something* of relevance to the plot. Mediocre episodes in episodic programmes are no better than sour grapes on the vine: finish one and you're left with a bad taste in your mouth. As blasphemous as it may be to say, not every episode of Mushishi is the epitome of perfection.\
On another note, the episodic format also has one other problem: it doesn't give the viewer an impetus to keep watching more episodes beyond whether or not they want to see more of Ginko and his exploits against the mushi. As much as I liked watching Ginko work his magic against the mushi that were plaguing some poor unfortunate soul, it's not the kind of show I would gladly watch again. If you've watched one episode of Mushishi, you've basically watched them all (this statement is especially true in both seasons of Zoku Shou). Obviously, that's not the case but that's what it feels like to me! I don't have any impetus to keep watching more episodes because there's no overarching story gradually progressing nor is there anything remotely entertaining I found whilst watching this show. Sure, I was mystified by what was going on but I wouldn't necessarily conflate that sort of enchantment with any feelings of being entertained.\
On the subject of characters, Ginko (the wandering shaman) is the only character (of relevance) we're ever exposed to. Yeah, every character we're exposed that ISN'T Ginko is exclusive to that episode alone and that's quite a shame too. There were some characters that I would've loved seeing again but just didn't because of that damned episodic format. As great as Ginko is, it would've been nice to see some familiar faces along the way. Speaking of Ginko, we never really learn much about him aside from a few details surrounding his past and he doesn't really go through much in the way of significant changes over the course of the programme. It's no stretch of the imagination to think that I actually struggled to find a reason to care about Ginko at all that goes beyond the fact that he's cool and he's also voiced by Travis Willingham. Yeah... Mushishi isn't exactly the epitome of characterisation to say the least.\
In terms of production values, Mushishi has it down-pat to say the least. This was a show produced by Artland and it would seem that they know how to keep the critics pleased, especially given that Artland was one of the studios responsible for bringing us the much-lauded Legend of the Galactic Heroes, the biggest critical darling MAL has to offer. It's safe to say that these guys know what the hell they're doing when it comes down to animating something. Audio-wise is also a similar story, since the OST and dubbing (across both the Japanese and English tracks) are also pretty damn good. Say what you will about Mushishi's story and characters, but I think we can all agree that this was one of the best-produced programmes to ever come out of 2005 as a whole.\
So, final thoughts? Mushishi is one of those shows that I can see why people like it in the first place but I just can't see myself getting into it but what do I know? I'm a filthy casual who likes garbage such as Elfen Lied and InuYasha in earnest. Maybe I lack the capacity to understand the true beauty of what's going on in front of me. Then again, you know what they say: different strokes for different folks. If you like Mushishi, that's fine and dandy but it's one of those shows I'm simply not a fan of. Anyway, feedback is always welcome and with that, I'm out. Peace :)\

    Mushishi is not my cup of tea. It's not a bad show. And in fact the music in the show is GREAT. Some of the best music I have heard in any anime period. The problem I found with the show is the lack of progression. There was nothing that drew to my seat wanting more. Every episode felt more or less the same. The Mushi Master visits those infected with 'Mushi' (or spirits if you will) and he has to figure out how to cure them. It's an exciting concept and I wish the series had a cast of reoccuring characters rather than just\
          \
        one main character. It would have been a lot better. \
But if you are looking for a relaxing show that is episodic nature. Has good story telling but no real character progression. You can just sit down and enjoy the beauty of Mushi Shi. \

    One of the most beautiful anime ever made, Mushishi stands mountains above every other show made in the past 7 years, this show is probably in the top five of the best anime ever made. In fact it might even be the best anime ever made. So why did I give this show a perfect 10 on everything? Because it really is that good.\
Story: There is no over-reaching story, rather this show is episodic, some may be upset about the fact the show is in this format, but that is what makes this show so special. The story generally is about a mysterious man (Ginko)\
          \
        who travels all over Japan and seeks to help people who have been affected by a strange parasite-like substance known as Mushi. The mushi are what really make this show interesting, because every episode they find different ways to continuing making life hell for the person in question. Anyway it is really really complex to explain a typical episode, generally Ginko meets somebody and then they will usually explain the problem and then most often then not Ginko will fix the problem. For those wondering if there is an episode dealing with Ginko himself, there is and it's about half-way through the series.\
Art: Wow, I honestly say this show is on a whole other platitude in terms of how beautiful the Art is. It is almost like you are watching a moving painting. I could go on and on but really better you see it.\
Sound: The music is beautiful, although the show is very quiet, it heightens your senses and you can generally detect a lot of sounds if you listen closely. The foley sounds are really well done and I should mention the music, which was composed by the guy who did the music to Naruto, which also has a phenomenal score. But Toshio Masuda's music really comes to life here.\
Character: There really is only one main character but Ginko himself, is what makes the show. Though he appears in every episode he tends to take himself out and let the protagonist of said episode tell his/her problem. As far as Ginko goes he is a very original character and he is not one that is made up on cliches. For instance if you look closely at the show you will notice he wears modern clothing while everyone else is in Traditional japanese dress; this question was posed Hiroshi Nagahama at Anime Expo 2007 and even he could not come up with an answer of why Ginko wears more modern clothing. Ginko's physical characteristics such as his white hair, green eyes and air of mystery make him one of the most intriguing original characters to grace the anime screen.\
Enjoyment: This is an opinion of how much I liked the show. I really, really enjoy the show and I'm still about 8 episodes away from finishing it, but yes this is probably in the top 10 anime of all time. However, word of caution, if you are someone who doesn't enjoy the slow pace of the show this could be an aggravating show to watch. Nonetheless give it 3 or 4 episodes and I think you'll fall in love with it.\

    Mushishi is the most simplistic yet beautiful series that I had the pleasure to experience until now and is one of the examples that shows the incredible variety that anime has.  \
Well then, ladies and gentlemen I welcome you to my Mushishi review. I hope you enjoy it.\
Now, the story of Mushishi follows our protagonist, Ginko, as he travels around the world working as a Mushi-shi. So, instead of having an over-arching story, this show chooses to have a more episodic nature. This way of telling the story has its own pluses and minuses. For one hand, as every episode has a different story\
          \
        the show never drags on, you can watch the show in any given order and you don´t need to pay attention to every little detail fearing that it might be really important to the overall plot, but in the other hand, it has some consequences in the characters, but I will cover that matter later on the review.\
So, as I said, every episode has its own story, usually involving Ginko trying to deal with a Mushi, the beings that the mushi-shis study, which in each episode create some kind of conflict. As such every episode has an interesting story, every one of them being fascinating from the beginning\
to the end, and is very interesting to watch what the mushi from each episode can do. The only problem with the story is that if you are looking for something \"exciting\" or \"cheerful\" then you´ll have to watch something else, as the nature of this show is, most of the time, rather depressing and it doesn´t really have \"cheerful moments\". But if you can look past that, sit back, relax and go with the flow of the series, you will most likely be pleased with the story of every episode, because none of them is by any means predictable, so you never know if by the end of the episode you will have a happy ending or a sad one, which keeps you interested in every episode.\
The artwork in this show can be described in one word: beautiful. \
The animation for this show is, not only fluid and consistent, it is a pleasure for the eyes, the colours used in this series, especially when a Mushi is on the scene, makes it one of the most astonishing animation out there, and when you think that this anime is from 2005, I can only applaud Yuuki Nobuteru for his superb work in this series. The backgrounds in this series are also very well done having precious landscapes to look. The weak part of this animation, however, is in the character design, because, there are a lot of characters in this series that look alike, specially kids, and while it is understandable that given the episodic nature of the show, they have to introduce new characters every episode and some character designs will end up repeating themselves, it is still a little annoying to watch a character that looks almost exactly like that character from the past episode, however this is only a minor problem. The other problem is that when a character is at a certain distance his face disappears, which can be strange to look at. But, overall, solid and beautiful animation and great backgrounds.\
This show´s music composer is Toshio Masuda, and he did an excellent job composing the soundtrack for the series, the soundtrack matches the nature of the series completely, is soothing, calm, relaxing and I love it. And speaking about relaxing the opening for this series, \"The Sore Feet Song\" by Ally Kerr fits the show as much as the soundtrack, is nothing really special, and is not something \"unskippable\" but it´s nice to listen to it in some episodes. The endings for this series are actually part of the soundtrack so they are really nothing very special. The voice acting is pretty solid and, while I have no complains about it, it´s nothing from another world and the only voice that really stands out is Ginko´s.\
The characters in this series, as I said before, suffer from its episodic nature, because the characters in this series usually appear in one episode and they are gone the next one, the only exception being Adashino-sensei, a doctor and collector of paranormal items, who appears in three different episodes. But because the characters appear for one episode you really never get to like them much because of the lack of screen time. In the end, the only character that you end up getting attached to is Ginko, as he is the only character that appears in every chapter of this series, being him the protagonist and everything, not that I´m complaining Ginko is a great character and while he is usually laid back he is a complete professional in his work. But besides him while some of the characters in this series are pretty good you just don´t have enough time to start liking them.\
So, this is a show that I enjoyed because it was very relaxing and the stories in every episode were unpredictable and interesting, but it´s something that you need to watch expecting that it won´t be \"cheerful\" or \"exciting\", but rather depressing even if an episode has a happy ending. \
In the end, Mushishi is the perfect show to watch with a cup of the hot beverage that you prefer and relax and you will probably not get disappointed with the show.\
And now I bid you farewell and I hope that this review has been helpful and that you have enjoyed reading this review as much as I enjoyed writing it.\
Wait, is that what what I think it is? A second season? Mushishi Zoku Shou? Well, better late than never I guess, time to watch it. Adiós, to you all.\

    Mushishi is a unique show in many ways. It’s rather weird and bizarre but is also very intriguing and definitely grabs your interest. This show was much different from what I expected it to be (in a good way) and for many episodes I had my eyes glued to the screen, watching intensely. Mushishi has a calm, mellow, and soothing, but also very deep and powerful feel to it.\
---STORY---\
I think the story is one of the strongest points in this anime. What makes Mushishi different from most anime is that it does not focus on a single overarching story and instead each episode has its\
          \
        own short story with a new plot and characters (aside from Ginko who is in every episode) And this actually works quite well as each story is beautifully well told with many powerful moments that sometimes leave you speechless. You may find a couple of episodes to be a little boring but the vast majority of them are very well written stories that pace themselves very nicely. If I were to describe the plot of the show as a whole, I would say it’s about Ginko traveling from place to place in feudal Japan dealing with different cases that deal with mushi. Which brings us to the next great point of this show. The Mushi.\
Where do I begin with the mushi? They are one of the most unique concepts I’ve come across. I’ve seen many things similar to demons and spirits in shows before but nothing quite like the mushi. Just trying to explain what they are can be a bit of a challenge. If you want the most accurate description of what they are then read the synopsis of this show. The mushi and the effects they have on people and the world are the main focus of each episode and there are many different types of mushi that take on different forms and act in different ways. There are some that reside in your pillow and make your dreams reality and there are those that slip into your brain through your ear and feast off of your memories until you can no longer remember anything. Some mushi are harmless and others are dangerous. And though many of the mushi featured in the show do harm, I absolutely love the way they are portrayed. Regardless of what they may do, there are no good or evil mushi. They’re just creatures trying to survive.\
Normally when watching shows or movies we see the characters go through many struggles throughout the story. But no matter how bad or hopeless it gets, we know that things will almost always end well. And that's a good thing of course. I mean everybody likes to see the protagonist come out on top. However in Mushishi this is not always the case. And because the show is episodic, they can get away with this. Some episodes end well and some don’t. Many of the mushi act similar to diseases. And like diseases, sometimes there’s simply nothing you can do. You can treat it but you can’t cure it. This is great because it keeps the show unpredictable and helps give it a good sense of realism as well as provide us with some deep and rather sad endings. And every episode I found myself always wondering “I wonder how this is going to end up. Will it end well for the characters or not?”\
The only real negative thing I think I can say about the story is that it does get a little repetitive. While the individual stories themselves are very different, each episode follows the same general formula.\
There is a problem.\
It’s mushi related.\
Ginko shows up.\
The problem is explained.\
Ginko attempts to solve the problem.\
Repetitiveness aside, the story is still spectacular and each episode is great and worth watching.\
---CHARACTERS---\
Ginko is the main protagonist of this series and is a mushi-shi (A person who studies mushi) He’s a calm, relaxed individual who is constantly travelling not just to solve cases involving mushi but also because he himself attracts mushi, thus he cannot stay in one place for too long or he will attract dangerous mushi to the area. His character is rather simple but I still found him very easy to like and he gets an interesting backstory about halfway thorough the show.\
Ginko is the only character that remains throughout the show. And aside from him, each episode deals with different characters. Despite this, the characters of each episode are quite good and easy to connect with and feel for, despite the short amount of time they each get in the show.\
---SOUND & ART---\
As for the soundtrack, it’s fantastic! The intro is amazing and does a great job of setting the mood. It’s also nice to hear an English intro every now and then. Especially one sang by a native English speaker. The outro changes every episode and all 26 of them are beautiful instrumentals and I sat through the credits every time just to listen to them. The art style is also great and really shows in the way they animate the mushi and the background. The only downside is that the characters themselves don't look very detailed and most of the side characters look very much alike and you might find yourself thinking \"Wait a minute. Isn't that the guy from the last episode?\"\
Dub or Sub?\
The dub for Mushishi is fairly descent. Ginko is played by Travis Willingham, who some of you may recognize as the voice of Roy Mustang. I had my doubts at first but now I can say that he was an excellent choice for Ginko. As for all the side characters, they’re mostly hit or miss. Some of them sound bad while others sound quite good. The good news is that for the bad voices you’ll only have to put up with them for one episode. The Mushishi dub is good but I would never recommend it over the sub. The voice acting in the original was truly spectacular and maybe its just me but when I watch an anime that takes place in feudal Japan, back when Japanese was pretty much the only language spoken, I feel that watching the Japanese version really helps give it that feeling of authenticity. So I will highly recommend the sub for this show. But this is just my opinion so watch whichever version you like :)\
---VERDICT---\
Mushishi is not for everyone. If you’re looking for an anime dripping with action then you’ll probably find this show very boring. Nonetheless, this show is still fantastic and I was very impressed with this anime. And if this show sounds even remotely interesting to you then I definitely suggest you put this show in your watching or at least in your plan to watch under high priority.\

    Coexistence is a difficult concept for humanity to grasp. All too often humans choose the path of domination rather than understanding and harmony, often to their own detriment. We fear the unknown. We reject the unusual. We hide our eyes from life's harder truths. Mushishi delves into these concepts as we follow the protagonist, Ginko, on his unending journey through a strange and beautiful world. In this world, their exist living creature that are neither flora nor fauna. These creature are made of pure life energy and are called mushi. In this world, mushi exist everywhere, but only a select few can see them. Ginko\

        possesses that ability, and works as a mushi master. Mushi masters travel the world studying these creatures and helping any humans that are negatively impacted by them. Mushi are for the most part benign and harmless, but sometimes in their quest to live and reproduce, humans come to harm. And that is where the story of Mushishi begins.\
Story: 9/10\
Mushishi is almost entirely episodic in nature. As I said, Ginko travels from village to village, searching for interesting mushi to study and answering the pleas for help that get mailed to him. Ginko tries to maintain the equilibrium between mushi and people, unlike most mushi masters that prefer extermination. It appears to be set in Feudal Era Japan. There are few reoccurring characters throughout, and you could almost watch the episodes in any order and still understand the bulk of the what's happening. Mushishi is an ideal anime to view if you're short on time because each episode is a satisfying experience in itself even if the time in between viewings is long. \
By far the most impressive thing about this show for me was how invested I became in each new story. Very few episodic anime have made me care so deeply for the new characters that are introduced each time. The stories are all very emotional. You'll find yourself experiencing many highs and lows throughout. The writers succeeded in making the conclusions all very unpredictable. Sometimes you'll cry or yell in anger or maybe just stare in disbelief. I was never got bored or complacent watching this show. \
The stories are all slowly paced, and there isn't much traditional action to be found. Shounen lovers may be put off by the lack of fighting. Romance lovers will be pleased to know that Mushishi has plenty of great love stories.\
Art: 9/10\
The artwork is absolutely beautiful. The scenery is amazing. No detail was spared as the artists rendered gorgeous setting after gorgeous setting. The character art is all fairly simple and traditional, but it works for the show. I would have liked to see a little more effort put into differentiating the characters from each episode though. Besides for a few select characters, most of the others look fairly similar to each other.\
Sound: 8/10\
That intro song! It's amazing how perfectly that captures the feel of the entire series. The rest of the music consists primarily of pleasant instrumentals that compliment each scene very well. I watched the English dub for this show, and I really have to compliment each voice actor. They really captured the emotion of each scene. Native English speakers should definitely give this dub a chance. I think even the most diehard sub fans will be surprised.\
Character: 10/10\
As I said before, considering you only see the majority of the characters for 20 minutes each, it's amazing how much depth each of them had. You'll often find yourself rooting for a character introduced only minutes before. As for the main character, Ginko, the show does an excellent job of fleshing out his character. Not a lot of time is spent on his backstory, but by the end of the show, you really feel like you know the whole character, through and through. There are no true villains in Mushishi (not even the mushi), just average people trying to make their way in the world. That contributes to the sense of realism this show projects even though it deals with many fantastical elements. \
Enjoyment: 10/10 \
I'm not one to watch the same anime over twice, but I can definitely see myself going back and watching this. The most important thing for my enjoyment of an anime is the ability to empathize with the characters and the ability to imagine myself in the storyline. I found that this anime really allows me to do that. I'm also a traveler myself. I trek long distance hiking trails, sometimes for weeks. Mushishi captured the spirit of adventure I often feel as I travel, and that probably upped my enjoyment quite a bit.\
Overall: 10/10\
I really did love every part of this anime. I would recommend it with enthusiasm to anyone that loves strong stories and interesting characters. This is a must-watch.\

    Less of a show and more of a journey; a spiritual one. The way each episode is laid out is fairly simple, there is a problem where a Mushi is involved and as such a Mushishi is called upon (Ginko our main protagonist is one of the many Mushishi). Yet through those problems be it successfully solved or not, we experience nature, humanity and all the range of emotions it has to offer. \
- Depth and complexity through simplicity -\
Sometimes a simple meaningful conversation beats 1000 flashy sword strikes. Mushishi does not try to use cliffhangers, exaggerated mysterious protagonist, complicated vocabularies and other means capable\
          \
        of creating the illusion of depth. Mushishi's naturally brilliant writing and execution of storytelling speaks for itself. \
This also applies to the music present in Mushishi. It’s hard to describe the feeling unless you’ve watched the show. Instead of having the music just to support certain scenes, Mushishi’s music walks together with the show. It chimes melodies at all the right timing further enhancing the viewer’s experience. The music composition mirrors the show itself, all the different instruments complements each other, knowing when to play and to harmonize.\
- As real as life gets -\
Despite its fantasy setting due to the Mushi, the show Mushishi feels real. It doesn't try to paint life in a certain colour or gives you sudden plot twists just to somehow save the day. Mushishi instead presents you life with all its dilemma and unpredictability. There might be a time where even after Ginko and the characters involved had given all they've got, things simply doesn't go the way they wanted to. That is just how life rolls. Life itself can get quite contradictory and unpredictable: We can say \"Look before you leap\" but then again \"He who hesitates is lost\". Mushishi illustrates a lot of thought provoking realisations throughout the show. \
Life flows the same way as each character we met through the journey, slowly forgetting some as new ones are introduced with different problems. It personally made me realize how things comes and go. From the friends that I met and forget, the parents that will depart before their child, the problems that we face in each stage of our lives. We are all a side character to each other with our own stories to tell. Through the realization that live is inherently meaningless yet through our actions and the choices we made, we gave it meaning. \
\
- Travelling with the protagonist not watching over them –\
While a lot of shows had successfully made me empathize with the characters none made me feel as if I am there myself as much as Mushishi. Through each problem and each choices I feel like I was there questioning what I would do in such a situation. \
Ginko is not a master samurai, a magician or a boy overcoming his fear to chase his dream. He is just a normal guy, who happens to be well versed in all things related to Mushi be it through studies or personal experience. But most importantly he is your travel companion and as Ginko involves himself in a fraction of another individual/families’ life, so do we. \
- Like flowing on a gentle river -\
This might be my personal preference, but I feel so many anime tends to be overly hyperactive (it’s like a house packed with so much furniture that you don't have enough room to walk and breathe). Mushishi strikes the perfect balance in terms of speed. Things just flows so well between scenes and conversations. I don't need to keep up with the show nor slow down to be able to appreciate it, instead the show made me sync in and be immersed in it.\
In short, Mushishi is a one of a kind experience that might appeal to a narrow group of people. But if you are willing to watch it with an open mind and appreciate it, it might just be one of if not the best show you will ever watch.\

    Mushishi is really one of those series that's very unique and mysterious. \
The story starts off with a Mushi-shi named Ginko, which throughout his journey, encounters different kinds of people that are in strange situations that are caused by these creatures called 'mushi.' They exist to somehow help out people that are afflicted by the mushis, so they act like medical doctors that's wandering about from place to place. The people he encounters are really unique, and their problems symbolize diseases in the real world, at least as I see it. Ginko appears in the villages where these peoples are and try to relieve them\
          \
        of these mushis, or just to try to help them out somehow. The mushis could be infesting inside the person, or exist outside their surrounding environment that could even affect an entire village. Either way, they cause something that makes their victims act strange. The story line is very episodic, but it really does fit the plot since each episode depicts Ginko being faced by a different problem each time.\
The art in Mushishi is really something that's worth appreciating. The vivid forests that Ginko travels through, the ocean that's constantly shown in the story, and the villages themselves are all very detailed and are just great just staring at them. Right when the first episode started off, I was thrilled by the details the people behind this anime put their backs into. The fog and mist surrounding the forests and the village makes me think of going outside on an early morning and breath in the crisp morning air while the birds chirp on the trees. That laid back feeling is really something. This could be a recent series that was first aired only two or three years ago, but I totally appreciate the animation and art on this one.\
The sounds involved in Mushishi are also great. The opening song just resembles one or two of my all-time favorite bands. The slow and mellow flow of the music is just laid back, and it just fits what the story is all about. Even the ending is very unique for an anime. Every episode ends with a different ending music, along with a different piece of art to show with it. With other anime, I usually just watch the opening and ending once, then the rest of the series I just skip them and go directly to what I'm supposed to be watching. But Mushishi is different. Every episode, I watch (or maybe just listen) the entire opening just for the music, then watch the whole ending for each one too. It's that great. The voice actors, specially the one doing Ginko's voice (in Japanese of course) really did a great job, so I give kudos to him for that. The sounds just come in at the right time, especially that bell or chime that rings out of nowhere, but fits the scene.\
Mushishi's characters are also great. There's the doctor that buys all of Ginko's weird collection, then the people that are afflicted by Mushis themselves. I kind of felt like there was a shortage of main characters though, but I think that making Ginko the character that everyone revolves around fits this anime anyways. That's because he travels around, and that's the only way of fitting all the pieces to the puzzle. Ginko's history also depicts someone that makes him what he is today. The people on this series also somewhat felt like they have the same faces, well at least mostly everyone, with a few that's just different. It felt like they have the same ancestors from way, way back then that just shows just now. But, that's just something weird that I had to add. But back to the discussion, I say the characters that Ginko meets on his travels are very mysterious as if they're ominous or something. But in the end, they're just regular people. \
This series is really something that I have enjoyed. It's something that persuades me to travel myself. No, it MAKES me want to travel. I really like shows where the main character travels to different places, and Mushishi just took the word 'Adventure' to the next floor upstairs. I really had fun watching the series, and it's a show where everyone will find something to enjoy. The creators really need to start thinking of making a sequel that covers the last half of the manga. PLS!\
Overall, this anime is my top favorite all time anime that even surpassed Cowboy Bebop. I'm really into action animes like Bebop and hilarious ones like GTO, but Mushishi got that humble feel to it that just makes one feel good about something. This work is truly a masterpiece, and I recommend it to anyone who's reading this review. \

    I had no idea what to expect going into the show. The description reminded me of the average American episodic TV show where each individual episode is some kind of case or problem and there is an overarching plot to keep the general story moving. I also expected some preaching about environmentalism and the effects of human habitation on the environment and other such morality-bashing. Thinking thus, I jumped in head-first and discovered what I can only express as one of the most beautiful experiences I have had. This show deserves every single grain of praise and more.\
The story is simplistic to the extreme. Ginko\
          \
        is actually never the true protagonist of the story. Despite being a very mysterious and somewhat intriguing character, replacing him each episode with anybody else wouldn't change the anime in any way because the true center of the story are the mysterious, vibrant, various, and occasionally vicious Mushi. The tiny creatures and their various effects on humanity are the central arc of the story. As humans continue to spread their influence, they encounter more and more of these weird creatures and their experiences with these beings is the totality of each episode. Rather than watching a show, the feeling comes across that we are witnessing the birth of folklore which is something I have not seen done often.\
The narrative simply flows from the start of the episode to the end, very much like the flow of a metaphorical river, indicative of the stream that is life. It is very real, the temptation to dump on our heads the lessons of environmentalism and the dangers of industrialization and the destruction of life etc etc. Yet this anime never takes that path and simply presents the events as they are. As the Mushi themselves, each episode just... is. Beautiful yet haunting.\
The art is outstanding (as is my rating). With an anime as slow and gentle as this, the art also reflects this tone. Characters are rounded, drawn with soft strokes, their hair straight, their clothing coloured softly with no loud colours and Ginko himself an oddity among them as the one who stands out. The environments are beautiful with dense forests painted lush greens, the waters a sparkling grey even rocks painted as unassuming objects with dull, short strokes. The Mushi, being the star of the show, are multicoloured, varied and lively. Each have their own characteristics and are hence drawn to reflect such characteristics. If you're looking for a lovely anime, this should surely be under consideration.\
The sound, as is the show, is also gentle with very little percussion or woodwind instruments. Strings and bells are the crux of most of the music driving further the impression that you are watching the birth of folk tales which begin in houses and small gatherings where such gentle instruments would accompany the tales they would narrate. Though they suffice, none of them are memorable and you wouldn't want to listen to them out of context of the anime itself.\
If it weren't for the characters themselves, this show would have fallen completely apart at the seams which is why it is remarkable how wonderfully relatable and memorable almost every single one of them are. All the people are real and simple characters with their own lives and problems. If they are suffering, we feel for them and want them to get better. We feel their sadness in their times of trouble, their joy in being helped out of their situations and their peace when they continue to live their lives or otherwise. I would have expected Ginko to be the aloof, mysterious, dark but helpful character we see so much, eg Black Jack. But the truth is he is merely another person, helpful, simple, blunt and without many layers to peel. He has only the simplest but sweetest of reasons to continue travelling and he does so with few complaints and has very little interest in his own mysterious past for, as a traveller, he has learned to look ahead and revel in the present and hope for the future.\
The Mushi too are characters in their own right. We are always told that they are merely simple creatures only wishing to survive, who only inflict harm because of their nature, not their intentions. However harmful, ambiguous, or terrifying they may be, they too, like the humans, wish to live on and we are able to empathise with that.\
IF my review didn't give you the impressios that I IMMENSELY enjoyed this anime, then again I tell you that I absolutely did and will surely return to any episode of this anime in times when I am in sorrow or doubt to calm myself down or to simply enjoy the beauty of this show again.\
This is definitely an anime you need to experience at least once in your life and you will be all the better for it.\

    They lay, unseen in the shadows, the mysterious beings known only as the mushi. They are the closest to the earth of any living being that dwells on its surface. They live around us all, and are, for the most part, very docile creatures, but they become deadly as well. When this happens, it is wise to seek the help of a mushi master. The story of Mushi-shi follows one such mushi master, named Ginko. A mysterious man who only stays in one place long enough to aid those who need him, and then leaves to the next place. \
The plot of Mush-shi is episodic\
          \
        and nothing short of extraordinary. If all the beauty in the world were to be moulded into a show, it would be Mushi-shi. Its roots dwell deep in ancient Japanese culture, it's heavily symbolic, but never obvious about it, and it's simply an amazing experience. The show seems to take place around the 1800s in Japan, but it is never confirmed, as much as all the Japanese culture in it would lead us to believe, as well as the fact that most characters in the show wear traditional Japanese clothing. It never loses an air of mystery, though, which does leave room for argument. The show always leaves you satisfied, and although it isn't one to watch in one sitting, it's a perfect show for before going to sleep. \
The characters are another interesting aspect of Mush-shi. Aside from Ginko, characters only appear in one episode (with the exception of a close friend of his.) However, each episodic character is given enough back-story that you care for them. You want them to overcome their troubles and live a happy life. You feel the genuinely upset for these one episode characters when they have trouble overcoming these obstacles. It's truly amazing how this was pulled off, and I salute them for doing so. Ginko himself is a very interesting character and always a joy to have on screen. He's laid-back, sarcastic, but always willing to help others. He really loves his work, even if sometimes it doesn't seem like it. Details on his character are given out little by little as the series goes on, and by the time you get to the episode with his story, you'll find it rather hard not to get teary eyed. He's one of those characters who you have to love. \
The art in this series is, you guessed it, beautiful. The character designs are simplistic but if they had been any more detailed, the show's tone may have been altered slightly. They're really better off simplistic. The characters dress in clothing typical for the setting, making it feel very natural. The colours and backgrounds are soft and inviting, adding to the lullaby effect of the show. The animation is rather minimal, but it doesn't need to do any more than it does. It's simple, but effective. \
Everything is a high point in this show, and the music is no exception. It's extremely soothing and again, beautiful. There is a lot of piano in this score which is used to great effect. The animation in the opening is very minimal, but the opening song, which is in English, is a very relaxing song and captures the tone of the show well. The ending of the episode merges seamlessly into the ending theme, sending you to sleep with images of the world you just left. \
This is one of the series where I refuse to watch it in a certain language. I absolutely will not watch Mushi-shi in Japanese. Odd, I know, considering everything about this show is Japanese, where as many other anime are heavily Americanised. Allow me to explain. Mushi-shi, as mentioned before, is much like a lullaby. I don't want to have to read when watching it. Honestly, I just want to relax and watch without having to worry about that. Your best off just watching in whichever language you know best. The acting in the Japanese is solid; I'm sure, as it always is. In English, Travis Willingham plays Ginko perfectly, as well. Not only that, but every single minor character is acted perfectly, without many miscasting. \
Overall, Mushi-shi is a stunningly unique and beautiful series. It isn't one to be watched for hours on end, but rather to watch before going to sleep. Everything about this series is beautiful. If you ever had trouble believing that anime was art, watch this series, it will make you think twice. It isn't action packed, and who knows, some people may find it boring, but can I take away marks for that? I don't think so, since excitement isn't really what it set out to do in the first place. It set out to teach people about how Japanese culture was and still is partially, and to act as a lullaby, and it surely does that. I could recommend this series to anyone, including people who don't normally watch anime.\

    Declared one of the best of 2007 by AnimeNewsNetwork, Mushishi is a supernatural drama set in old rural Japan that boasts visuals and storytelling over action and fanservice. Mushi are a group of primiative lifeforms that are neither animal nor plant, and invisible to most people but have lived amongst humans forever -- kinda like poltergeist plankton. Their shapes and sizes can vary from small as an insect to as large as a small pet. The show follows a man named Ginko who is a 'Mushishi' -- a witch doctor of sorts. One of a small group of people who can see Mushi, he studies\
          \
        them and helps people whose lives are being effected by them. Ginko has the added problem of being a person who attracts mushi as well, forcing him to be nomadic to help maintain the balance of life in the areas he's in.\
The best part of this series is the artwork. Beautiful landscapes of lush vegetation, constant light and atmospheric effects, and special effects used for the mushi don't look like CG pasted on top like in a low-budget series. Character design wasn't bad, except that there wasn't enough variation between the appearance of the villagers, making it appear some are in multiple episodes when in fact it is a different person every time.\
The stories themselves are fantastic in their humanity and charm. The quality of the writing varied some (especially near the end) but overall kept me happy throughout the show. Mushishi is first and foremost not an action series, and would generally bore anyone who's really looking for stimulation. I've heard people say you shouldn't watch it late at night (because it will put you to sleep) and while I can't say that's accurate, it is a series you generally have to be in the right mood to enjoy.\
The music is simple and calming. It may be a little cheesy or repetitious at some points (like Casio-keyboard Muzak for the local Chinese buffet) but generally sets the mood right for whatever is happening. Only the opening theme has any singing, and the ending score that leads out each episode changes each time. Those are so nice and blend so well with the final minute or so of the story that I generally sit through the end credits to enjoy the rest of the song.\
Mushishi is entirely episodic in nature, and there are only one or two references to previous episodes made in the entire run of the show, neither of them were important plot-wise, so the viewer is free to watch the show completely out of order for the most part. It's also a slice-of-life show, meaning that the stories don't always have a conclusive start or finish. Some of the stories end on a happy note, some sad or bittersweet, some don't really resolve at all. A couple of times we start with Ginko having already met the supporting cast and the story already begun. This also means the series itself has no conclusive end and the final episode was a little weak.\
It took more than three months for me to watch the series, and it should have been done in a month at the most. But the one-episode stories and overall feel of Mushishi makes one not want to watch it quickly. But that's okay in this case, and I still highly recommended it for someone looking for a more contemplative adult anime or for fans of high production values.\

    **Minor Spoilers**\
 This was one of the most challenging anime I've ever had to watch in a very long time.\
This series was recommended to me by one of my very close youtube friends because he felt there was a lot of similiarities between my personality and the personality of the main character in the series known as Ginko. This series has received a lot of critical acclaim but unfortunately reflecting on what I have watched and I say with regret that I did not enjoy this series as much as everyone else.\
Let's focus on what I liked about the series compared to what I didn't\
          \
        like.\
The Good. The anime in itself has some of the most beautiful tranquil music and beautiful natural scenery I seen in an anime period. The folk style storytelling is pretty solid but there is no sense of progression minus a scatter scene here and there from select episodes that builds upon the main character. Every episode is kind of a detective story with regards to the plot and the resolution for the plot for each episode. It's kind of fun to kind of guess throughout the episode how to fix the problems the mushi cause since the episodes are very self contained. You could start on episode 1 or episode 17 and you wouldn't feel lost because the storytelling aspect in each individual episode is incredibly strong.\
The Bad. Pacing is the number one problem with this anime. For the most part, a lot of the episodes are incredibly boring with no significant build up throughout the majority of the episodes. It was incredibly challenging to me to even get through one episode straight through because the majority of the episodes I had to pause around 10 to 15 minute mark because it felt so mentally exhausting to get through. The anime has a hard time deciding on what it wants to be because half the episodes have good endings while the other half of the episodes have dark depressing endings to them. I don't mind when animes want to have a depressing feel to them. I have watched vampire princess miyu after all. I just wish Mushishi could of been a bit more consistent with regards to its storytelling. This anime can be a very depressing anime to get through but in a way it deals with how harsh life can be and no matter what you do your fate can be to an extent uncontrollable. There is no humour in this anime (none) but it can teach some very valuable lessons about life in general.\
Overall, its really hard for me to recommend this anime because it is going to be different from a lot of other anime that people have seen before. I personally struggle with depression myself but I can admit that because I'm not perfect but this was an anime I would of been better off watching if depression did not have such a significant hold in my life since I work away from home quite a lot. If you want an anime with some solid storytelling, beautiful tranquil music and imagery than by all means watch it because in my eyes those are the strongest points in this anime.\
I will admit though my favorite episode in the series is the episode where we see how Ginko loses his eye and obtains his white hair. \

Let us cast it’s brilliance past the rainbow and it’s colors.\
In the anime once in few years, there is a certain work that transcendents the medium, – while not necessairly revolutionizing it – pushing the envelope and reaching a pinnacle rarely seen, creating something completely unorthodox and creative. It lies down to personal prefferences which shows are especially deserving that title, however I do believe that “Mushishi” - without a doubt- places itself as one of those titles. Anime is an expressive form of art in its own way, telling a story by the exploitment of the audiovisuals and it’s script, which is what differenciates it from live-action works. Sometimes this \"art\" is utilized to produce poor, commercialized shows not worthy of mentioning, however sometimes it’s used to satisfy more demanding viewers. Studio ArtLand famous for creating the crème de la crème of anime – a legendary War Drama OVA from 90’s: Legend of the Galactic Heroes - once more in 2005 decides to produce something of sufficient quality – Mushishi, consisting of 26 episodes - yet 9 years later decides to release 2 more seasons consisting of 10 episodes each, which is very admirable, taking the fact, not many studios these days are willing to take the risk, instead of supporting commercial and unimaginative works created for the sole reason of merchandising, supporting the otaku culture, which is one of the reasons why anime is rarely taken serious by people not familiarized with it. Obviously, a big mistake. \
\
All anime despite of their quality, or the effort put from their creators can be called as “art”. As long as an individual finds something to be aesthetically appealing, whether that be a decent visual experience with plot or an universally hated work, that's all that really matters. But sometimes you'll stumble across works that take it a step further in order to invent something outstanding enough to put to awe most of it’s viewers in order to place itself as one of the biggest successes in the medium. And to many in the community, one such work that has reached the pleasure of being that outstanding title is, the anime Mushishi. Mushishi portrays an undominated by civilization world of feudal Japan during the Edo period, filled with it’s melancholic and tranquil tone, yet transcendental and mystic nature of what lives beyond it – Mushi – the most basic form of life in the world. Existing without any purposes and goals, Mushi are unorthodox spieces, seen in countless forms, such as diseases, animals, weather or unearthly forms of unsearchable phenomenas, while living next to a race not fully aware of their nature, nor their significance in their lives – the human race. The people gifted with the vast knowledge of them are called title Mushishi’s. As Mushi are neutral spieces, while can be seen as helpful, they can also be very dangerous. That’s when ordinary people not understanding the reason of their sorrow are placed before hope and the cathartic understanding, when the main protagonist – Ginko, while being one of the Mushishi, wanders through the villages to teach people not only how to deal with Mushi, but also how to deal with problems caused by them.\
Most of Mushishi’s emphasis is placed on the portrayal of it’s separated stories. The show is episodic, each one portraying separated story only connected by the Mushishi – Ginko and Mushi causing incomprehensible problems to people he meets along the way. Ginko is laidback, yet responsible and caring; intelligent and cunning, ready to help, yet never takes any side in conflict and also can get selfish. The character doesn’t get any real development throughout the story, yet feels very “alive”, which is the testimony of powerful characterization by it’s author. The show lacks any action, it’s slow and immensely captivating, yet this title’s prowess for crafting almost \"healing\" atmosphere is peerless. Each episode - even if not every of them is ending happily - leave the viewer with a bittersweet feeling of satisfaction, since the emotional crescendo doesn’t come until the end credits, hence the delightment carried out is the most powerful at this point. There is no way of predicting the outcome - as in nature itself – not every outcome is determined by whatever is the most favourable conclusion. So while you are watching things that are often tragic, in Mushishi what you’re really watching is a person watching a sad story, and then moving on. Tears are shed, but Ginko remains impartial in spite of all this, gaining little more than the experience itself, as do you. Considering that, Mushishi is a work not only about some mystical “things that does weird things”, but mostly about people and their problems. Is your sorrow only yours? The solitude you carry on your back, does it end with your life? Some of the Mushi portrayed are extremely bizarre, yet can get a symbolic meaning. Unconditional love, loss, empathy, loneliness, relieve... The themes portrayed can be seen as simplistic and universal, yet they are extremely relatable, being the things we all long for or experienced along our way, which only increases their meaning. \
If anime could ever been called an “art” in it’s own way, then Mushishi is master canvas brought to life; it’s art personified. The rich visuals, astonishing landscapes and the emphasis put into it’s sound effects, creating a friendly atmosphere is what makes that animated work “alive”. It doesn’t try to ostentatiously convince you into it’s cleverness, yet those willing to look beyond what is visible at the first glance will surely find something worthwile, as what you can receive through can be far more meaningful. There are very few works I will ever proclaim as a masterpiece, while giving them a 10/10 score and Mushishi is one of them. It’s a title, which pushed the envelope far beyond my expectations and has become something far more significant in result, as it can change at least a small part of us for better. And im conviced that anyone, trying to check it out will be at least entertained by it.  Maybe they also won’t see any Mushi, Monsters, Ghosts or Ninjas hiding below their bed, but maybe they will try to look honestly into the eyes of a beloved one, sit down in silence to listen through the symphony of their own body, think about their happy memories, not  as nostalgic transcience, but rather feel a gentle joy of creating the new ones, to look at the world from distance as a chess board of their infinite capabilities. Maybe they will value nature more and value people with indulgence, by the size of their heart, rather than their appearance, or perhaps they will finnaly try to trust someone and try to look up to the solutions of their problems through the ways they haven’t tried before. To discover some of the world once more. \

    Mushi. Strange lifeforms said to be more primitive than germs and bacteria. Very few people can see them and they can cause strange phenomenom ranging from weird illnesses to paranormal events. And we also have the Mushi-shi. Mushi experts specializing in eradicating or capturing harmful mushi, helping people with their mushi problems. One of them is Ginko, the mushi-shi with a strange white hair, traveling to various places to help people and also to seek more knowledge about mushi.\
Despite having a relatively high rating, my expections for anime was rather low. It doesn't have action, it doesn't have romance so pretty much I just watched\
          \
        this anime on a whim. But after finishing Mushishi, I found myself thoroughly impressed because this was indeed a great anime.\
Mushishi is an episodic anime set in fictional old Japan. Watching Mushishi reminds me of folktales and legends. The way the story is told, mixed with gloomy and sometimes relaxing atmosphere of the show, really gives you this feeling of eeriness. The story itself is unique and creative. There is no overarching plotline so there are new characters every episode with new mushi problems and of course our mushi hero Ginko appears to save the day. The story sounds simple but I have respect for the creators of Mushishi and writers who create episodic stories in general, because not only will they have to create new stories every episode but also every episode needs to be just as good as the last one. And unlike non-episodic anime, episodic shows doesn't have cliffhangers to keep viewers from watching.\
Artwise, Mushishi's backgrounds and sceneries are well-done, capturing historical Japan very nicely. However, I can't really say the same for the character designs. The characters looked to much alike. There were a number of times where I thought I was looking at a character from a previous episode. Well that is pretty much the only gripe I have with regards to the art but all in all Artland did a great job.\
Anyone who watched Mushishi will definitely remember the opening theme \"The sorefeet song\". The song doesn't really have anything to do with the story or theme of Mushishi but I personally think it's the perfect op for Mushishi because it surprisingly fits well with the atmosphere of the show.\
There are a lot of characters in Mushishi because it is episodic and most of them will never appear again in later episodes. So I'm not going to talk about the supporting characters anymore because they are not given much characterization and are only created solely for one episode. Let's just talk about Ginko the main character. Ginko is by far not a complex character but that doesn't mean he is shallow. He is level-headed, insightful and very knowledgeable. He kind of reminds me of Kakashi from Naruto. Put simply, he is the type of characters cool boys wants to be when they grow up but fails miserably.\
Overall, Mushishi is a great anime that you shouldn't miss. If you want a breather from all the battleshounen or romance shoujo you're watching and would like something that is unique and well-thought-out, then you should watch Mushishi. Highly recommended.\

The meaning of life may be within the medley of artistic expressions in a mushi... it is both about that which isn't and that which lives... art and nothingness... these seasons have some themes that are possibly transcendental... love, loneliness, existence... the music, the colour, all complement to create a canvas of beauty...\

    Can an anime that has an interesting story, a well outlined main character and quite the originality not be enjoyable? Well, Mushishi certainly isn't. Mushishi only seems to be useful when you have insomnia problems and want a fast remedy to literally make you fall asleep. Not once while watching anime have I felt the feeling Mushishi left upon me; and I certainly don't want to experience it again. It's as if the series is trying to implant upon the viewer Ginko's personality itself – thus leaving the audience to feel old, tired and lifeless. A single episode of Mushishi might destroy all the lust\
          \

It's as if you go to the zoo to see a big, exotic, dangerous animal –but all that animal does is eat and sleep all day. In the beginning, you might find the animal itself fascinating –but at the end of the day, you leave with a disappointed 'after all it's quite boring and troublesome' expression on your face. \

    Here is a seriously unique anime experience that everyone at least ought to give a shot. It does have some serious flaws that should not be overlooked, but its strong story-telling, gorgeous background art, sublime take on horror, and intriguing central character all insure that this is something truly special--to be cherished by only a few perhaps, but so be it.\
Mushishi concerns itself with the traveling healer Ginko, who specializes in illness and other associated phenomena caused by 'mushi,' which seem to be troublesome spirits, but which Ginko insists are a form of life akin to something between plant-life (or perhaps fungus) and insects. Mushi\
          \
        are not purposely malevolent (indeed, they don't really seem to be 'purposely' anything), but in their own struggles to survive and breed they affect the world around them in troublesome ways--and when people come into contact with them, the results are often frightening or tragic. Having an unfortunate history with mushi himself, Ginko has become a mushishi--a person who specializes in the 'biology' of mushi, and who uses his knowledge to help others who come into contact with them. \
I see this show frequently described as a 'horror' (more specifically speaking a 'body horror') and while I suppose that strictly speaking this is true, it doesn't tell the whole story. It is true that the people who find themselves in symbiotic relationships with mushi often suffer in some physical way (though not always), and occasionally this suffering enters into some truly squicky territory. However, even at its most horrific, Mushishi pulls together some truly beautiful, unforgettable imagery. One can quake at what is actually unfolding on the screen, but nonetheless be in awe of the sublime artistry that is on display. If Mushishi is a horror, than it's a beautiful horror, with some sequences attaining an almost transcendentally lovely quality. (Comparable to Miyazaki's work, in some instances. I would particularly, and favorably, compare Mushishi with Princess Mononoke.) It's hard to describe without sounding like a dope or using lots of superlatives, but the writers and animators take advantage of the uniqueness of the mushi to put on display truly generous displays of wonder.\
And speaking of wonder: dat background art. And dat music. And dat writing. And dem voice actors. Nearly everything about this anime screams quality, but I would particularly like to single out the main character. Ginko is the glue that holds everything together here. Mushishi is a purely episodic series, where he is the only regularly recurring character. There is no overarching plot to speak of. The episodes could be watched in completely random order and it likely would not affect one's experience with the show at all. There is no real beginning and certainly no end. I would argue that there is a subtle emotional arc to the series and would encourage people to watch it in order, however, and this arc relates entirely to the development of Ginko himself. \
There are two episodes that flashback to Ginko in his youth, but otherwise Ginko himself is something of a mystery. In spite of this, the writers wring a great deal of character of this secretive, mysterious man, and they do so with great subtlety and feeling, aided immensely by the animators and the Japanese voice actor. (I must report that the English voice actor does an alright job, but Yuto Nakano *owns* Ginko.) Watching him carefully and listening to him intently is a surprisingly rewarding experience--pay special attention to the way he acts around children and women, or the way he deals with villagers. There is a lot to Ginko, coiling just beneath the surface. And Nakano masterfully expresses this without ever giving too much away, gently emphasizing Ginko's quirks, and even imbuing him with some quiet but powerful sex appeal. It's one of the best male voice performances I've ever heard, right up there with Jurota Kosugi as Akio in Revolutionary Girl Utena and Steven Blum as Spike in Cowboy Bebop.\
I could go on and on, not only about Ginko (have I mentioned his character design yet? God, I love it!), but about everything else that this series does right, as well. But I feel like I need to explicitly state that it's not all peaches and cream--there are some things here that may really bug you, assuming that you don't mind the episodic storytelling at all.\
For starters, there are the character designs--almost all of them who aren't Ginko. They're not bad character designs--I actually really like them. The problem is that there's less than a dozen of them to be spread out across the whole twenty-six episodes and however many dozens of characters there are. As powerfully written and acted as all of these dozens of one-time characters are, it's a huge blow to the show that they're not given their own unique faces. One could argue that this was done purposely--thematically, doing this does make some sense within the context of the show, but I find it to be a blow to the show's quality, nonetheless.\
On a similar note is the music. Again--fantastic music. And I mean that--it's truly a wonderful score, perhaps one of the best I've heard in an anime series. But there's far too little of it to stretch across all twenty-six episodes without it becoming stale, and it is certainly not helped by the fact that it's used in almost exactly the same way in every episode, and even in the same order. Similarly, with very few exceptions, all of the episodes follow nearly exactly the same structure. Which I suppose you must expect to some degree from an episode series, but here it gets to the point of being almost painful. There was one stretch of episodes in particular where accurately predicting the fates of some of the characters was so easy to do that it was almost funny--and it's all because of patterns that the show establishes.\
For me personally, these are not insignificant flaws. There are ways around them--for example, this is honestly a show that I would never marathon. It is best experienced piece by small piece, and I would not recommend watching more than four episodes of it in a day. Indeed, ideally, I would recommend that you only watch one episode of it every night, preferably right before bed. Go on watching whatever other anime you are marathoning at the moment, then finish your night off with one episode of this. \
In fact, this is almost a show that I could watch one episode of every night before bed for the rest of my life--it just gets you in the right state of mind for sleep. Not because it's boring (though some people will find its slow pace and lack of action to be just that) but because it's just seems like such a perfect prequel to a night of dreams. \
One last thing--if you're looking for an anime experience similar to this one, I'd highly, *highly* recommend Kino's Journey. Seriously, if you haven't watched that one yet but you love this show, you are wasting time simply by allowing yourself to finish reading this sentence. ",

    Ok let me start off by saying, that nigga Ginko was on some real shit. I want whatever he's smoking. I decided to review this anime, because it made such a huge impression on me, but perhaps not for the reasons one would assume. \
Honestly, to the untrained eye, this anime was BORING. Excuse my blatancy, but to someone who's accustomed to the high-paced, exponentially increasing plot lines which are evident in many action and shounen anime, this show is like your fourth hit on a blunt. The effect just isn't as stringent, or lasting, if you will. \
But where Mushishi really caught my eye,\
          \
        was the originality, and the subtly embedded within it, which leaves the audience with a sentimental understanding of something more than just basic plot or entertainment. It's not such a slap in the face with emotion, or appearance of profundity; in fact, it's quite the opposite. The seemingly minute deviation from different story lines contain the interest factor in other aspects. It may not be an on-the-edge-of-your-seat type of show, but in essence, the simplicity complimented the sensibility. I must say it was a refreshing change which causes you to think beyond moe and tig 'o biddies. \

    Ginko is a Mushi-shi, a travelling man studying mushi and solving the problems of people related to the mushi. Mushi are neither plants nor animals, they are life in its purest form.\
Story:\
Mushishi is an episodic show, every episode has an unique story of it's own.\
The storytelling is perfectly handled and the blending of reality and fiction is very well done. Many episodes makes you think of how you would handle the problem and what your reaction to the mushi would be. Originality also plays a big role in Mushishi, every episode feels like a new and fresh story and the mushi are always different than\
          \
        the ones before so it doesn't get repetitive at all.\
The formule for every episode is pretty much the same but since there are no rules set in the mushi world you never know what could happen and that makes for some mindblowing endings. Another great aspect of Mushishi is that in many episodes you can actually place the Mushi in the real world and it would perfectly fit the problem that's occuring without being unrealistic.\
Characters:\
Our main protagonist Ginko has a great sense of justice and doesn't place the mushi in a category of good and evil. The mushi just try to survive, just like we do. I see people claim that Ginko is underdeveloped, but that's a false statement since he is already developed. He also has a great backstory and a good sense of humor. He even builds his own harem while following his journey(JOKE). But he's not the main focus, the main focus here are the mushi situations the side characters get in. The side characters always have solid development especially for an episodic series and a good amount of depth to them, their reactions are realistic and their bonds are showed really well. The only little complaint I have is that some of the characters look too much like eachother but that doesn't ruin my enjoyment for the series at all. Sometimes the characters could use a bit more development by the end of the episode.\
Sound & Animation:\
The music fits this anime perfectly, it's relaxing and mysterious and adds to the amazing atmosphere which is one of the best in all of anime. The voice acting is also very good and fits the characters very well. The art is amazing, the backgrounds are some of the best I've seen in anime and the characters are well drawn. It also has two great opening songs, with the second opening being one of my favourite openings of all time. Every episode has a different ending and leaves you sitting on your chair as if you've just seen a movie.\
Overall:\
I have never loved an anime as much as this, I feel like this will be my favourite anime of all time, it could change but I doubt it. It's so relaxing, unique and well done. I will say this anime is not for everyone, and you probably shouldn't marathon it because of its episodic nature. Also, Mushishi can be very dark so be aware of that. One of my few 10/10's.\

    Hmmmm... I don't know how to start it.\
This anime is a 26-free-episode series about Ginko, a traveling mushishi, who makes a living with studies about mushi, which are something like forms of pure life affecting many aspects of almost whole world's existence. Nobody knows what mushi actually are. Maybe the source of all life, maybe something equidistant to flora and fauna, maybe dispersed God. This, and many more questions to find answer for, is a reason for mankind to have mushishi, the link between our world and somewhat astral world of mushi.\
BTW: Ginko, the main character, is very similar to The Witcher. An outcast with\
          \
        white hair, eyes issue, cold blood in every situation, working as a regulator between humans and strange creatures... I wonder if Geralt was an inspiration to the creators of the anime.\
This is enough to say about the series as a whole. Every episode has its own plot and this is where we have our first disadvantage. The quality of individual eps is very, VERY irregular. Some of them were very good, some (mostly) mediocre, and some were damn boring. Especially in the middle of the anime, when I watched them jumping from scene to scene after seeing the first half of an episode to make it shorter.\
Now about the main advantages of Mushishi. First, the atmosphere of feudal Japan with remote villages and tiny towns was presented perfectly. The climate, the nature, the clothing, everything is on its place.\
The second thing that delighted me is the art. My GOD, this is beautiful. Stunningly beautiful. Even seeing a couple of screens can force you to watch the whole anime. 10/10 for the landscapes. However, the character design was painfully repetitve. Especially kids looked totally like clones (maybe it's a joke against the people who say that every Asian looks the same ;) ).\
Music is beautiful too. Written by Toshio Masuda (composer and guitarist, creator of Naruto's OST), who really knows how to embrace classic Japan in notes. Still, the soundtrack is rather short and you can hear the same background melody dosens of times.\
Did I enjoy it? Well, maybe it's not original and boring sometimes, but it's a nice anime. A good springboard if you're tired of intellectual, multilayer series but still want something serious and/or magical. Moreover, you can stop watching it anytime you want and come back later, because there is no coherent plot to remember.\
A strong 6. Maybe 6,5.\

    Mushishi is the story of a Mushishi, or Mushi-Master, Ginko, as he travels around the world helping those who are having Mushi troubles. Mushi are unique beings that aren't plants, animals, nor human. All Mushi are different which can cause for quite an interesting story.\
Story - Well, Mushishi is a bit different. It doesn't follow an actual plot, but instead has episodes that are unique to the overall basis of the story: a Mushi is causing trouble to someone or some village and the Mushishi, Ginko, tries to help whoever is in need of help. However, the stories are very interesting most of the time\
          \
        and will hold the viewers attention. I will admit, some of the stories were a bit boring, but 90% of them were really good.\
Art -Well, the animation of the actual Mushi was good, however, the characters in each episode were pretty much drawn the same. In fact, you might get confused sometimes in the beginning since you have to realize that other than the main character, there aren't many recurring characters despite the similar appearance. On the other hand, the overall animation of the detailed backgrounds were very nice. You'd be amazed if you just paused on some of the mountain or forest scenes. Quite nicely done.\
Sound - Being a supernatural anime, I enjoyed the 'spooky' sound that came from it. The OP and ED also followed this supernatural-theme, which was very enjoyable. The sound went together nicely with the anime.\
Character - Well, not much development is shown since we only have 1 main recurring character, but we do get background on Ginko in a few episodes. It would have been nice to see some more, though. Ginko is pretty like able too since he is very levelheaded and knows what he is doing. \
Enjoyment - Most of the time I really enjoyed Mushishi. However, since some of the episodes weren't that good (more or less around 5 of the 26 episodes), I did get bored throughout those, but otherwise I found the episodes to be really unique and interesting. \
Overall, Mushishi is a very unique supernatural anime that will gain praise by any Supernatural fan. If you prefer things like Romance, Comedy, and Action then this is not the anime for you. But anyhow, I enjoyed it. ^_^\

The closer to the palm of the hand, the simpler the creature. Around the wrist, all the blood vessels come together, right? About there are fungi and microorganisms. It's hard to distinguish between plants and animals at this point. But high up the arm, past the shoulder, close to the heart, there are still things beyond those.\"\
These things are called \"midori mono\" - Green things -, or \"mushi\", a slightly misleading term, given it translates to\
          \
        \"insects\" or \"bugs\". Because they are much closer to being the very essence of life rather than mere manifestations of it, few people are able to actually see them. One such person is Ginko. Being a \"mushi-shi\", a mushi master, he travels rural pre-westernized Japan conducting research and helping people who get to indirectly experience the existence of mushi, as these outlandish creatures tend to be the cause of sorts of strange phenomena and problems.\
The original manga could be called an anthology, seeing it is basically a collection of unrelated short stories. The anime, consequently, is episodic in nature, meaning it contains no overarching story, not even two-parters. Each episode is a self-contained adaption of a chapter from volumes one to six of the manga.\
Over the course of twenty-six episodes, there are only three recurring characters. One of them appears in no more than three episodes and another one remains but a faceless narrating voice - except for that one time. The third one is Ginko. His rather unusual appearance reflects the fact his ability sets him apart from other people. Although the time the story is set in would normally require all characters to wear wafuku - traditional Japanese clothing -, Ginko is always dressed in yofuku - typically Western clothes. In-story, however, no one seems to even notice, and unlike regarding his hair and eye color, the viewer is never given any explanation either. \
Ginko's personality is even more unusual. If the average male lead is a boisterous hothead who acts purely on impulse, Ginko is the exact opposite. Whereas other mushi-shi think of the mushi as vermin to be exterminated, Ginko knows they inflict problems on people because they are, like every other living thing, doing what they have to in order to survive. If, however, the only way to save a human life is to eliminate a mushi, he will do so without regret. He simply understands the way nature works and accepts it.\
\"Why do you kill us?\"\
\"Because you consume human children.\"\
\"It isn’t my fault.\"\
\"It isn’t my fault either, except we're stronger, so you're going to die.\"\
While this may imply that Ginko is somewhat wooden or stoic, he is, in fact, rather laid-back. His facial expressions can be quite funny and his manner of speech is blunt, almost rude at times. He does not like to lecture people but prefers to give them just enough advice for them to be able to make an informed choice. Needless to say, people don’t always listen.\
Mushishi is often mentioned in the same breath with Kino no Tabi which is understandable in a way, seeing both are episodic anime centered around one person travelling. And while I rather like Kino no Tabi, I'd like to emphasize that Mushishi is much more subtle, much more unobtrusive in its approach, but much more thought-provoking notwithstanding. Sometimes calming, sometimes disturbing, there is something about its general vibe that feels incredibly special, magical almost.\

    Mushishi started as a manga by Urushibara Yuki. It won her a couple awards and got adapted into an anime at the end of 2005 going into 2006. The adaptation was handled by Artland, the studio behind Gunslinger Girl Il Teatrino, Ichiban Ushiro no Dai Mao & Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu. Which isn't exactly a strong track record but it's also a small sample size. So, how does Mushishi compare to the studio's other offerings? It'll be very difficult for it to not be at least the second best thing I've seen from them. \

Ginko is a mushishi, a person who studies and deals with complications caused by organisms called mushi that many people can't even see. I'm not sure how that's supposed to work given the way eyes function but it's a fantasy world so they can have elements like that. Each episode presents a mushi related problem. Each episode focuses on a different issue and how it gets resolved. \
One thing I really appreciate about the series is that it does vary a lot. Ginko may show up right away or come later. He may investigate or he may know exactly what's going on. He may or may not have a good solution. Things may end happily, tragically or bitter-sweetly. It creates enough variety to keep things interesting and to keep the audience invested in new situations as they come. The pacing in the individual episodes is handled very effectively as well. The atmosphere is really good and the world itself is quite intriguing.  There are some episodes that are better than others but there aren't any that are bad. All of them are good, at least. The series continually introduces new mushi which is good in that it keeps things interesting but it also leads to some of the solutions coming across as forced. Almost like Urushibara came up with the idea for the problem and wanted a specific ending for the characters who were having trouble but didn't know how to get to it. Fortunately, there aren't many episodes that have solutions like that but there are a few. \
Characters: \
We only have two major reoccurring characters, Ginko and his friend Adashino. They're both really strong characters with a good level of depth. Then we have the side characters who frequently take the focus for the individual episodes. These characters do get well fleshed out and have serviceable motivations for what they're doing. They all have verisimilitude and that helps create investment in those scenarios. Even the less important side characters still manage to come across like actual people. I also appreciate that those characters who are put into antagonistic roles have sensible reasons behind what they're doing and are usually acting more out of ignorance or greed than any malice. \
Art: \
The visuals are superb. The backgrounds are really detailed and there are some gorgeous nature scenes. The mushi are frequently visually interesting and there are some legitimately creepy moments with them. The characters also look quite good, although the way mouths are drawn can be odd. \
Sound: \
The voice acting is really good for both the major and side characters. Nakano Yuto in particular does a superb job in the role of Ginko. The music is nicely done and suitable for the series. \
Ho-yay: \
There really isn't any in this series. Some of the side characters get romance but it's always het. \
Final Thoughts: \
Mushishi is an excellent series. It takes a good premise and uses it to great effect. If you're looking for an episodic series, I do recommend it. My final rating is going to be a 9/10. Next week I'll be looking at another series I was asked to review. It's going to be Love Hina. \

    Disclamer: Let me be fully serious now: Mushi-shi is a crazy 420 weed show about an old man who has a big addiction and nobody tells him about it and is not safe for kids to watch. Nobody has seemingly to put this together but me, but I feel that for the children and their safety I have to say that first! Now, onto reviewing this crazy show!\
The story is like a said, some dude keeps hittin the bong and sees freaky things called Mushy, and helps people come down from their high! I am never kidding, was this show made in Colorado or Hamsterdam!?\
          \
        It is a touching and imaginative journey that is highly episodic so there isn't much to spoil, much like the Journeys of Kino, except Mush-iy's Ginko is a man. There is also some exploring of nature vs humanity and the togetherness of them.\
The sound in this show has a lot of soothing sounds because it mostly takes place in nature, where all the good drugs come up. Stoners like me, and people boring like stones, will feel right at home on their trip. Meanwise, the art of the show is stunning beautiful and goes perfectly with Pink Flyod or some celtic band that chubby chicks might like similar to Nitewish; there are so many colors and makes you want to get away from society!\
Your enjoyment of the show is depending on how long you like episodes that do not have much connection or big development. There is very little to tell you that Ginko will ever quit smoking so much, or that others will give up their addiction in the long run. If you like art and relaxing while you munch down some chips, you will love Mushy!\

    i will be 100% honest with you guys. i know you are reading this review because you have doubts whether to watch it or not because IT LOOKS BORING. admit it!  i honestly admit it! because im a fan of ACTION PACKED animes so at first glance it looks boring from the cover art itself up until the description. Last year i tried  watching this series because of curiosity like \"What the hell, a boring anime on top like duh\" and episode 1, to be honest i only watched the first four minutes and my reaction was  \"its so boring !the dialogue\
          \
        is boring the story telling is soo boring\" and i immediately closed the tab and never watched it again (the opening song is so beautiful tho) until last week i decided to give it another chance and tried to bear the boringness of the introduction but i realize the importance of it. for those who plans to watched this ill give you a simpler explanation.\
Mushi is \"BUGS\" in Japanese, Mushi is also a term used to describe an organisms that CAN'T be seen by the naked eye. /e.g. like our souls, ultra violet rays etc./ But the protagonist GINKO and some selected people has the ability to see and interact with them\
Ginko is a mushi-shi(mushi master) some characters in this series gave him weird looks because they cant see a mushi and misunderstood him as a Bug/insect master whenever he introduce himself, LoL\
Mushishi is an episodic Anime which means you can watch any episode anytime and every episode has different and interesting stories (my favorite is episode 3). This series is very relaxing and an eye opener i usually watch 1 to 2 episode every night a good bedtime story. the art is beautiful as well as the animation and the expressions of the characters is also good. Some episode will make question everything about your own existence like when you put your hands in your ear you can hear a volcano erupting or like how do people really sleeps because when you close your eye you can still see your eyelids but when were already asleep we only see pith black do we have 2nd eyelids? and something like that. Some stories goes very slow but you wont attempt to skip even a second because IT WONT BORE YOU im telling you IT WONT. and yes i regret not watching it the first time but im happy that i already did! so watch in now and thank me later :)",

    Mushishi is one of my all time favorite anime's the score given because at a realistic view it does have its problems\
The story isn't exactly put together in one entire season, more of a series of mini stories involving mushi (which can take a little getting used to depending on your tastes) but overall the story is drawn together and shares interesting plot points as an episode.\
\
The art and sound are BEAUTIFUL. depicting water colored backdrops whether its a forest or looking at the cliff of a mountain. The sound also makes you feel like you're drawn into Japanese culture as you are watching the\
          \
        story unfold as well as the aesthetics of both calming you and giving you the relaxing feeling you are looking for.\
Unfortunately the main character development is lacking. You don't find anything out about the main character's history or backstory in depth, basically it is just rolling with the punches. And considering the episodes are completely different each episode, you don't find anything out about the characters in the story  after the episode is over so its easy to forget them. \
The enjoyment value is good as long as you're willing to give it a chance and use your noggin when watching the episodes. Its more of a thinkers anime rather than a balls to the wall action story but it holds it's own in a different way.\
Overall with the mixed score I have to give it a 7 out of 10.The story is ok but never has a huge plot point. Basically each episode being  a mini story about mushi, and the ending could use some work (then again thats usually an anime's weakness lol). The art and sound are a beautiful mix which is relaxing and breathtaking, which goes along the same beauty as the major movies mihuzaki has created. Character development is lacking and needs a little bit more padding on Ginko's backstory, And it will only fit certain audiences if you are willing to give it a chance and are a fan of episodes that make you think and make you have to focus to understand what is going on. \

    Mushishi, tells the story of Ginko travels, he is a mushishi, a person who is traveling and solves problems caused by the mushi.\
Mushi are the most basic and pure form of life, sometimes they have strange powers, and some cause a lot of problems to people.\
This was the strangest of all the anime I've seen, and strange not mean it's bad, I quite liked the anime, is very different from any anime I've seen, is a more calm and peaceful genre, no wars or struggles, is simply gorgeous. \
What draws more attention in this anime is the beauty of forests and fields, and also the\
          \
        mysteries of mushi and Ginko. \
Ginko is a very mysterious person, rarely talk about his past, and he does not remember his past. But exist an episode in which described a little of his past, spoke of how he lost his eye, and stood with white hair. And it was there that he met the mushi yami (darkness), perhaps the worst mushi that exists in the anime. \
The story does not have a chronological, in each episode Ginko visit a different site and solves the problems caused by the mushi. \
He can not stay long in the same place, because he attract the mushi, which can be dangerous for the inhabitants.\
I really liked the anime for being different than I usually watch, the landscapes are beautiful and I love the calm with which everything happens, it is very good and everyone should watch. :)\

    A masterpiece.\
There are some shows that are addicting, some shows are to be gulped down like a severely dehydrated man drinks water and then there are some shows that need to be savored, shows that are are like a balm on irritated skin - cool and soothing, to be used at regular intervals and at each time giving so much satisfaction. Mushishi is the latter kind.\
Watching it while letting the amazing art, beautiful sound and touching stories wash over me was such a great experience. It is an anime that could have gone on forever and I would have watched every minute of it. You\
          \
        can just see the amount of love, work and thought that has gone into crafting every frame of the show. Every scene is a work of art. The scenery captures more than just the image, it captures the soul of the place.\
The world is particularly impressive.\
What struck me as extraordinary was the fact that there were no evil people or creatures. There was no monster that the hero is fighting. The people aren't evil for the sake of being evil. There are occasional grey characters and even they are just out to survive. Even if something is harming us, the idea that we should consider that it is just trying to live and we should tolerate it is so foreign in this world. In our world the knee jerk reaction to something bothersome is to destroy it. Ginko's empathy is not seen as something extraordinary in the anime, just a part of the world. That universe is completely fleshed out.\
The mushi live an existence separate from what we know as normal and that is okay.\
The stories are complete and they work very well even taken without the whole. What moves the stories are the characters. We are only introduced to them for a short while and we see them as human in the sense that we don't understand them completely, we don't have to understand them completely but we know their story and that matters.\
I love detective stories and Mushishi is paced like one. Introduce the problem and have the detective figure it out. The eureka moment doesn't give the same jolt that I get when a detective figures out a problem we are baffled by even when we have all the information, but it is still nice. Another important part of the anime is love, in its most powerful and intangible form. It is in every story and in every form.\
The music flows through the show. The opening track is with its visuals sets the tone perfectly and drops gently into the story, the background slowly pulling its viewers into the story and keeping us there till a few seconds after the credits start to roll. The feeling that the story continues through the credits, that the story continues beyond what we have been told, that the characters we were with live on is solely because of the beautiful music.\
Ginko is the main character but it isn't really about him. This is such a strange show that way. It isn't character driven in the sense that we need Ginko to make the story interesting. In many episodes he seems almost like a foot note in the main story. Even in the final episode, where I was expecting some kind of bang, just has him as a secondary or even tertiary character. It is a testament to how compellingly they have written that world that we don't need an anchor to sink into it. His western clothes remain a mystery (albeit a well dressed one).\
I really wish there were more episodes of Mushishi.",

    \"Mushishi\" is one of the strangest things i have ever seen in my whole life.\
It's very hard to understand it,and in some episodes it's playing with your mind in a way that any anime doesn't.\
The concept of \"mushi\" it's very complex,yet so fascinating and from my point of view,one of the most interesting concepts in fiction,including anime,movies,books and so forth.\
I think this anime is the most spiritual out there.I don't think that any other anime can beat this one in the \"spiritual way\".\
I had inexplicable nostalgia from watching this,i felt like i traveled in time,and i was a part of the events that occured in\
          \
        this anime.\
It made me to put questions to life and to death.\
I give it a 9,because i felt that it was too much in many places,too complex and hard to understand,and very exhausting.\
The structure of episodes is strange as well.\
One episode don't have anything at all in common with another episode,so if you skip an episode,you don't have anything to lose,besides the magnificent atmosphere this anime give to us every time.\
This show is for atmosphere and atmosphere only,from my point of view.It's is the biggest achivement.\
Story(9)\
The story,like i said,revolves around the only constant character,the traveller Ginko.I think the story is great and mystic, but i can't give it a 10 because i felt that it could have been much much better.\
Character(9)\
Ginko is the only constant character in \"Mushishi\".He is the only one that appears in every episode.We know little about him,from 2 episodes that deals with his childhood.He is one of the most mysterios characters i have ever seen and his construction is fantastic.\
Art(10)\
I enjoyed it so much.I put the older art above the newer.And the visuals are beautiful in this anime,with all the landscapes and pictures of nature.\
Sound(10)\
The most gorgeus thing in this anime is the music.Along with the action and dialogues,the music creates one of the best atmosphears i had encounter.\
Overall(9)\
This is such an underrated anime and it deserves more recognition form anime fans,and if you like seinen and more serious stuff;dramatic,nostalgic,atmospheric,and in some parts very dark;without comedy at all,this is for you.\

    \9Mushishi is a collage of very simple stories set in a very complex world, very much alive. It will not score many marks on character, drama, action, or tension, or any of the things that tend to captivate viewers. It remains, in spite of all that, compelling; and because of all that, refreshing. \
\9It's not possible to talk about Mushishi and not talk about the setting. The setting makes the story, and the character. In Mushishi, we have Mushi as the fundamental life-force of the world. For most, these remain invisible, for some, they are objects of curiosity acquiring tangible form, for a few, they\
          \
        are a fact of life. Mushi are integrated into every aspect of the world: a place without Mushi is barren and lifeless, but too much of it spells disaster and invites tragedy. \
\9In many ways, the setting of Mushishi mimics life: Mushi themselves are incapable of good or evil, that is why they are simultaneously beneath human morality and above it. They are part of nature, part of a grand balance. The balance is constantly shifting, changing, but is a balance nonetheless. As humans, the question is whether to accept this balance, and coexist with it, or to fear it, and attempt to master it.\
\9There is a second facet to the world of Mushishi. As always, the human element exists secondarily to nature. Expecting something more akin to Kino's Journey, I'd been surprised when I realised that the story was set in an alternate Edo-era. Part of this decision on the part of the mangaka, I suppose, was due to nostalgia, and part of it, I think, must be due to the idea of coexistence. Perhaps it came down to a very simple question like: how did people live before machines? And before industrialisation? And perhaps most importantly of all, before they lost their vital link to nature. \
\9The world is alive, and fluid, it is not just a blank tablet made for humans to carve meaning into. To exist, then, one must also coexist. \
Then we come to the characters. Ginko is the name of the man. White-haired, roguish, stoic, dressed in distinctly western garb, (and not to mention somehow popular with both the gents and the ladies) he is in many ways the outsider, and as a result of that, he is who we identify with. Ginko is human, flawed, apathetic, eccentric, which makes him all the more endearing (I speak for myself) and  relatable. Simply put, Ginko is the Red Schuhart of Mushishi.\
\9Ginko does not belong anywhere. He does not hate people, nor nature. He gets along. Likewise, he does not hate mushi. It is through his eye(s) that we see the world in all its ethereal and Lovecraftian splendour (I will explain the Lovecraft parallel later). Yet he is always the visitor, the drifter. There is something that enthralls every Romantic, the idea of walking the world, without goal, without ambition, just taking in everything, and being alive. Something Chris McCandless would have agreed with, surely, but perhaps not the 'alive' part. I digress.\
\9Ginko is more than an outsider. He coexists. He belongs in the natural world of Mushi, just as much as he is ill at ease in the human world of, well, humans. Ginko is part of the setting, part of the living world. It is not man against nature but man with nature, man as part of nature, and vice-versa, and so on. \
\9I suppose, one might see mushi as characters in their own right. Like people, they are capricious, having their own needs, stubborn. But they are not people: theye have no motives, except insofar it serves their bodily needs. They have no agenda but for survival. They are not capable of deceit. Like Ginko, they are misunderstood. Like Ginko, they come and go. And not unlike Ginko, they are nature.\
\9The structure of the series is episodic. Every part can be watched separately in no particular order, which complements the content perfectly. There is no real beginning to the story, nor any ending. The conflict and coexistence between human and mushi will endure.\
\9Other than the worldbuilding, another keystone to Mushishi is the tone. The sound and the visuals synergise with each other to weave a sense of serenity. I have few words to say about the visuals. I'll admit that I have little by way of taste, but I can tell you that they are quaint, and calming. Various mushi seemed to be modelled on real creatures, so that they are familiar but enthralling.  The colours seem subdued, so that you always feel as if you're looking at a corner of a great rolling painting, rather than at a jumble of them. Still shots are common, and Ginko often alone, but it manages to be neither melancholic nor foreboding. There is always the sense of wonder.\
\9The music compliments tone, the best I can do to describe it is that it's about 'being' and not 'doing'. There are no hectic marches, no heroic anthems. In the same way that the plot is more about existing and restoring nature, the music exists: it goes nowhere, it just is. One might even see Mushishi as a Taoist work. The concept of a balance mirrors that of the 'Tao', and the idea of living simply and mindfully tallies with 'Wuwei'. In a way, the music underlines Ginko's principles: it is not as though Ginko cannot act; it is that most of the time, he refrains from doing.\
\9Finally, let me end with the Lovecraft comparison. There's no need for me to go into detail. The topic has already been thoroughly discussed by JeffersonAirship in his post titled 'Mushishi: the Anti-Lovecraft' which you can peruse at your leisure. The gist of the matter is that whilst both works deal with superhuman natural forces: sometimes gargantuan, often dangerous, always unpredictable, Mushishi accepts what Lovecraft has rejected: the idea that humans are insignificant in the grand scheme of things. Yes, there are things too terrible to call creatures lurking all too near us, yes, we are so tiny that they do not even notice us, yes, if and when the do notice us, we perish, and yet, Ginko shows us that we can still live in knowledge of them. Lovecraft would treat mushi as a lore rightly forbidden; Ginko seeks mushi and seeks to know everything about them: the reassuring truth, the ambivalent truth, the unsettling truth. All. In a way, Mushishi is the enlightened view to Lovecraft's Luddite-ness.  \
\9I have noticed that I've given Mushishi unimpressive scores on most of the criteria, and for some reason it still holds a special place among the anime I've watched over the years. There are facets and nuances that simply cannot be captured by a ratings. The bottom line is that it's a fresh perspective for things we have too long taken for granted. Things like nature, coexistence, mastery, and our place in the Great Chain of Being. The setting is at the centre of it all. Character, plot, music and art all revolve around a world that is fluid, immutable and unknowable. Ginko and the mushi are interwoven into the very mystery of nature.  Perhaps we are, too.\

    I am reviewing Mushishi after a second viewing. I was really surprised about a lot of the elements of this anime, It's not a mainstream anime and definitely not something for everyone, especially if you only like fast paced animes or watching a lot of episodes one after the other. Mushishi is more of a relaxing anime and makes you think about your life and the meaning behind it. It's an episodic type anime. Each episode is separate and has no specific plot. It's mostly about Ginko, the main character, going around solving Mushi related problems and interacting with the people involved with these problems.\
          \
        A Mushi is a type of being that lives side by side with the humans but I will let the anime can explain it way better than me since it's not so easy to explain, the anime does it better (episode 1). I will now analyze the anime section by section before giving my final impressions.\
Story:\
If it's episodic, it doesn't mean that the story has to suffer because of it. On the contrary, I find that Mushishi delivers quite well with short stories that are different one episode after the other. This type of story telling gives us the satisfaction of seeing the end of an episode as we know it really ended there. Another element of Mushishi is in it's various ending on it's 26 eps run. The ending can be, sad, happy or neither and leaves the rest up to you to decide on how you might have imagined it ending or what might have happened after. Mushishi has a great relaxing flowing story that focuses more on the characters telling you the story and really engaging you like if you were part of the conversation at times and listening as a 3rd person. Overall, the small stories makes it unique from other animes and leaves you with a great sensation at the end of the episode where you have time to think and relax your mind. \
Animation:\
The animation in Mushishi is simply beautiful. The art really puts emphasis on the whole theme of nature and the background is so beautifully animated. The Mushi's are drawn quite nicely and gives us these vague and mysterious looking things. Their entire existence is kind of vague and mysterious as you will learn as you watch this serie. Nothing else to say for the animation except the fact that it really is gorgeous.\
Sound:\
The soundtrack by Masuda Toshio is one of the best soundtracks I have heard in animes. He composed it so well that the soundtracks matches perfectly with the story and the situation that they are in. Also the ending song or rather soundtrack is different at the end of every episode which makes it easier to appreciate. It's easy to just listen to the ending song while rethinking about the episode. I sometimes found myself just looking at the credits while listening to the ending song. The soundtrack for this anime is just great, I have no complains.\
Character:\
In this anime, the main character is Ginko and he's pretty much the only actual character that's a \"regular\" in every episode. Since this anime is very episodic, you will not see any character development but rather you will see bits and pieces of Ginko in every episode. Beside Ginko only the doctor and Mushi collector shows up in 2 or 3 episodes. Putting all that aside, the characters from every episodes feels real, they have a certain realism to them the way they act in from of certain problems or situations. You can in some sense relate to their problems and they pact they decide to take on resolving the problem. Overall, the character was good but sadly we don't any character development which would have it made it better. \
Enjoyment:\
I enjoyed watching this anime for various reasons which involves great music by Masuda Toshio, the amazing animation, the great short stories and down to earth characters that we can relate to. I really liked the ending songs changing from episode to episode which really matched with the ending of the episode. It leaves a calm feeling and makes you really think about the episode that you just watched. It also lets you think about life in a certain way.\
Conclusion:\
I really enjoyed this anime and I highly recommend it for people who like slow paced, relaxing and calming anime with life lessons at the end of every episode. \

    Mushishi, in every sense of the word, is an experience. Not only is it an experience for the characters that are told in the episodes; it's also an experience for its watchers. You feel sympathetic towards the people you watch. You only see them for a set time limit of about twenty minutes, but you may go through years of their lives. After the episode is done, you feel like you've known them personally. That's how real and powerful Mushishi feels.\
Mushishi is one of those anime gems that really cares about the important things that made anime so great in the first place. One, is\
          \
        the superb animation. Each episode seems to get a certain color range depending on the Mushi it sponsors. In one episode, the mushi was a type of purple flower and so every frame had some kind of purple hue to it. In another episode, the colors are bleak and gray until the very end when the mushi appear and burst into vibrant colors.\
These patterns usually happen in the beautiful backgrounds of Mushishi.\
By contrast, however, the humans are of simple design. Realistically, most characters have dark hair colors and plain clothes. This contrast forces you to look at the nature scenes and grasp their splendor.\
Sounds also play an important role in Mushishi. Toshiro Masuda does a very good job at making the mood through this sounds. There is no melodramatic music of an orcestra or annoying j-pop/j-rock songs; just simple instruments and simple melodies that are very calming. Masuda also made all the ending songs, for Mushishi doesn't truly have one ending theme. This way it is better; it catches the mood for each episode quite nicely.\
Funimaition provided the English dub, so if you watch any of their stuff you'll instantly recognize the voices and they do their jobs exceptionally well.\
However, voice acting is not one thing Mushishi stresses on, even for the Japanese version. Everyone talks in a slow manner, and they sound natural (unlike most anime with screaming pink-haired characters). Sub or dub, you'll get a good deal here. Watching the dub will probably be the better deal, since then the focus is on the screen, not on subtitles.\
Once the talking is finished, the most striking detail of all was the emotion you can feel in response to watching such a soothing and tranquil anime.\
 Besides the obvious short stories that come out of episodic series, there is a back story that occurs throughout the whole series. But what it exactly it is is up to the viewer. The first episode had a quote that can resemble the series: \"Life in its purest form.\" In Mushishi, everyone is living their lives, along with the mushi. It's only when they interact with each other when things get complicated.\
Mushishi is one of those series that are best seen through animation.\
The anime is also an art form. An art that both entertains and makes you think long after the credits roll. It makes you want to pack up your things and walk through a forest. It touches the part of you that feels like there can be so much more to life just waiting to be discovered by finding yourself in a new town...\
Pros:\
+ Splendid animation that is prone to detail\
+ Characters you can sympathize with\
+ Not cliche at all\
+ Is highly rewatchable\
+ Unique soundtrack\
+ One of the best dubs\
+ Follows the manga almost frame by frame\
Cons:\
+ Shorter than the manga\
+ Not too many recurring characters\
+ It leaves you wanting more\

    Mushishi to me, is like that one friend that we all have. You love seeing them... for about twenty minutes and then you realize why you haven't seen them for so long. \
At the beginning i came into the show thinking that i could finish it in a day or two. Two years later, between falling asleep through episodes because of the blissful and calming music and dark art styles. To forgetting which episode i am up too, resulting in starting from the beginning, i can happily say Mushishi has been a pleasure to complete.\
The premise of this story all revolves around Ginko the Mushishi\
          \
        and his travels throughout the land in search of helping people with mushi related issues. Every episode focus' on a new group of characters (with the exclusion of Ginko) and the problems they are going through caused by a type of mushi. Blah blah blah, i'm assuming everyone has already heard of Mushishi, if not you know where to find the descriptions. All in all, the stories are somewhat darker than what i expected which was a nice surprise.\
The art style was something truly unique. Throughout every episode is has been consistently dull, which worked in it's favor tying it perfectly with the story. The detail of surroundings and landscape were brilliant taking into consideration that it was created nearly 10 years ago. \
Sound was a strong component to this show. It fitted the mood exceptionally well. Simple is better, much better. This anime doesn't go over the top with this component, which i feel is the reason it worked so well. Sometimes all a scene needed was a softly played instrument to set the mood.\
The character development was brilliantly done for the character that each episode was based around, which is hard because it is all episodic and got a fresh batch of characters every episode, but thankfully it worked out. I was however a little bit disappointed with the amount of personal background information our main man Ginko didn't get in season one. In saying that, it wasn't necessary to the plot and we still got some pieces of information here and there.\
All in all, this show was truly one of a kind. \
Now time for me to watch season two, \
see you in two years.\
Byeee.\

    “Mushishi” is an anime that I would use as one of the best examples for „artistic“ anime. An anime is artistic when the purpose isn’t to tell the audience a normal story (which means it has distinguish start and ending, characters and everything else a “normal” story needs) but to present them a creative work, so something other than normal.  \
Lets look at the word “Art” before:\
The very definition of art by Wikipedia already says: “Art refers to works of creative expression”\
Well art is a very subjective word, so everyone can make something and call it art, or claim that something he likes is\
          \
        just simply art and if you don’t like it you don’t understand it.  If the person who says that or who creates art is famous probably all his fans will do so as well, which would explain all the weird shit in the nowadays modern art museum. Anyway, art in its core has the purpose to satisfy its creator. Often creators included little details which are there to inspire the imagination or the personal attraction to an artwork for the viewer. A deeper meaning is often the “creative expression” art is supposed to have. But this deeper meaning is not always so clear. The hard work behind a picture, the years of training and learning or the endless failures to get it right one time is maybe the real reason for the emotions one has for his works of art. \
If you don’t like it than it just simply doesn’t appeal to you, it is not because you don’t understand it. Like I said, art is a very subjective thing, some might say modern art is so special because it has some kind of deeper meaning involved, others might say something else. For me a stories itself have a lot of connection to art, since there can be hard work behind them, a deeper meaning and creativity. Those stories are for me even more interesting, but sadly the anime community has shown how little viewers are interested in hard work behind their shows. Shows that are creative in not only their story but also their artstyle or characters are either unnoticed or hated while producers milk the cashcows with the same shit that sells for years. Shows that make up over 90% of the anime that come out every season. That’s why shows that want to break this manner with creativity are always welcome to me, if they prove me to be worthy to watch. And Mushishi is one of those shows.\
\
On its surface is Mushishi an anime which is easy to go into. It has a very beautiful artstyle, which isn’t that much unique and creative, especially not in their character designs. It shows a lot of nature, which makes it so appealing, since nature is not only a thing humans will always feel attracted to but is also a high selling point in the industry.\
It also has a very fitting soundtrack for that artstyle, with calm natural tunes. And I think that’s already why this anime is so populare and liked. If Mushishi had the same artistic artstyle and soundtrack as it has artistic storytelling it would have the same amount of fans as “Aku no Hana”. I think as well that with only the artstyle and soundtrack and a normal story the anime would have been boring as hell, since the artstyle and the soundtrack are very unchanging. But Mushishi doesn’t shine in its music neither its artstyle. It shines in something else. What would that might be? Well Mushishi doesn’t have a continuing story with a baseline. Its characters are flat and uninteresting, especially the main character lacks of emotions, motivations and everything which would make a character realistic and interesting. He is simply an ordinary guy who tries to safe everyone. It would be euphemistic to call him a “cliché” character.  It’s so called “story” is completely unfocused and unimportant. \
But that is only because of one reason or purpose. Mushishi revolves around creatures called “Mushi”, which aren’t humans, neither animals, but something else and they are only visible to certain humans. This already is just a creative idea to appeal to a certain audience. In this show they deal with lots of different forms of this mushi and every time it’s a little bit different. \
To present a topic which should interests the audience. Nothing profound and deep, only something very simple but abstract and original. Something you probably have never seen before. That is its key, its only purpose. The rest is just the build around, the way the anime brings you this idea. If there wasn’t some kind of story the ideas wouldn’t be brought to the audience in this gripping way. The static and unchanging soundtrack and artstyle are only the ignition of the topics but made so perfectly together. \
I can’t tell you if you will like Mushishi, since that matters if you will like the topic it presents. I also didn’t like every idea it presented. Some episodes where great, others uninteresting. I would suggest to try it out and see for yourself. But I would say since its very calm and nature like many people will be appealed by it. \
\
So in conclusion: Mushishi doesn’t shine with well written storyline, after all its an episodic anime, neither does it shine with interesting characters. But Mushishi shines with fire inside the viewer’s minds, ignited by a simple picture, a simple idea. Everyone who doesn’t understand that fact is probably one of those who likes the male lead (Ginko) and who thinks the anime is about the story failing to understand its purpose.\

    Hello... this is my first review, so I apologize if many mistakes in there.\
Don't judge the story by its cover. It's my impression for this anime.\
I always looking for anime like this. Although I ever seen this anime on Top 50, but because the anime was not popular like Steins Gate, FMA Brotherhood or Clannad and Shigatsu, I mean it never became a topic of discussion in some Indonesian Anime Group, and I never heard the anime,  so I not too interested with this anime.\
But, my friend told to me and recommended me to watch Mushishi, he says that the score of anime was\
          \
        high (of course it's on top 50) then suggestion me for watch it, he says it surely, so I watch the anime.\
When I watch first episode, I think this anime will make me bored. Bored anime bored anime, lol. But after I watch it, I feel relaxed and enjoy. I want to watch again! give me more!\
And now, lets see the anime\
This anime giving us the stories between Human and Nature around it. Like in the synopsis, Human was life with \"Mushi\". A \"being\" that can't be seen with all Human. some \"Mushi\" are capable of mimicking things from the natural world. They have an odd shape. This is the most Interesting point.\
The main character just one, he's Ginko. He was a \"Mushi-shi\". Mushi-shi are those who can see a \"Mushi\" and researching them, and because of that he had a journey. He wears a white plain clothes and jeans (he looks cool when the setting was in past period).\
I really like the story, very interesting. In every episode, we will given a different story. The conflict between Human and \"Mushi\" will remember us, that human are nothing without nature, and humans need nature. In each episode, Ginko will solve the problem of the conflict with his knowledge of Mushi. Seriously, I love this anime.\
Then, for the art and graphics, its very simply. The art seems \"dark\" and the graphics aren't stiff. I think it's suitable for Fantasy-Supernatural anime like Mushishi.\
And for the sound, really relaxing.\
For opening song, it's really fooled me in the first time. I think, becasue the opening is so \"Romantic\" then the anime will have a romantic story, but until end I did'nt find any romance story.\
\"Every single night and day.... I searched for you.... \
Through sandstrorm and hazy dawns... I reached .... for you...\"\
Very romantic lyrics.\
For ending theme is an instrumental song, and every ending have a different song. You will enjoyment the anime until the end of the song.\
Neither Opening Song, Ending Song nor Background song are so great. Very suitable for the anime. I'll give it 10\
For the character, they're amazing. The depictions not rigid, and they follow the plot. Really natural.\
For me, I really enjoying the anime. Amazing story, beautiful \"dark\" art and soft graphics, relaxed song,  and natural character are amazed me.\
This anime very recommended for who like soft and SOL anime with adventure, the slow plot will make you washed away when you watch.\

    You need help with mysterious ghost-like creatures getting in the way of your life? Ask Ginko for top-notch assistance.\
Mushishi: One of the most unique animes out there to say the least. An episodic series focusing on one character, Ginko, who is basically the only recurring character from start to finish. Knowing that to be the case, the series may be hard to get hooked on to. But in this review I will reveal why such a unique concept can be executed so greatly throughout the 26 episodes. In other words, I will show how Mushishi works as a whole.\
Ginko is, broadly speaking, a true genius\
          \
        and the hero of the series. Known as the Mushi Master, he is a credible source for any Mushi-related problem. Solving different cases episode after episode, you could label him a very dedicated man. With all the mysterious mushi dwelling in the dream-like setting of the series, Ginko can solve practically any problem that is related to mushi. And often times, the mushi are an invasive species. When that is the case, Ginko can exterminate the invasives and solve everyday people’s problems. I think of Ginko as the guy who just loves what he does, and solves cases very intelligently. That is what makes Ginko genuinely human.\
The setting is always very relaxing and dream-like. And this type of anime qualifies for that kind of setting, being a episodic series with one main character. I could tell that a lot of precious time was spent creating these great background settings. They were truly beautiful and unforgettable. The background, along with Ginko’s character, makes the anime so heartfelt. To have such a genuine main character, and also make the visuals just as strong, separates a good anime from a great anime. Mushishi accomplishes both of these aspects.\
I could easily tell that a lot of effort was put in for the episodes to make sense together as a whole, even while the anime did not have a continuous plot. The way Ginko solves the mushi-related mysteries is always very unpredictable and intellectual, and I thought it was great that it was consistent throughout all 26 episodes.\
The sound was the only weak point I could possibly point out. The music is absolutely beautiful, when present. But a lot of the time, the show remained silent in terms of music. It seemed slightly minimal in my opinion. I could have enjoyed the series even more with just a little bit more music in the background, especially at climactic parts. But that didn’t even come close to ruining the anime for me. I was amazed by other things such as what I mentioned in earlier paragraphs.\
Mushishi is a beautiful work of art. There had never been a show like Mushishi, and there never will be another show that expresses similar concepts. 26 perfectly paced stories, legitimate character Ginko, and crazy good visuals make this anime a must watch for all kinds of anime fans. Why do I say to all kinds of anime fans? Because its so vividly shows such a unique sensory experience to all viewers.\
Overall: a fantastic anime, 9.5 out of 10\

    To be completely honest, I never really got warm with Mushishi.\
Nonetheless its still a pretty good anime.\
Story: 7/10\
Mushishis plot is completely episodic. Yet, every episode still is unique in its own way, with varying endings, plots and characters. Like a 20 minute movie.\
Art: 8/10\
The backgrounds of Mushishi are really outstanding and probably one of the best backgrounds I've seen so far. The character designs on the other hand are mediocre at best. Besides main char Ginko everyone looks the same. The Mushi on the other hand have great and varying designs, making all of them really unique. Animations are fluent and nicely done.\
Sound: 8/10\
The best\
          \
        thing first: Again the background. The OST has an awesome spiritual ring to it, which outlines Mushishis idea. Same goes for the ending songs, which are unique, yet similar to each other and blend in with the anime. As far as the opening goes, I think \"Sore Feet Song\" is a pretty average song, which still manages to fit to the anime just as well.\
Character: 6/10\
Which characters to begin with? There is only Ginko. And well, to be honest, he's basically just this good-willed anime main char, as seen times and times before. His background is only mentioned as sidenotes every now and then, which is more interesting though. Definitely better than just telling us 'Well, that's his background, deal with it.\". A real character development is missing as well, at least for Ginko. The minor characters of each episode develop by coming in contact with Mushi.\
Enjoyment: 6/10\
I already told you, I never warmed up with Mushishi, thus rather disappointing enjoyment.\
Still, its quite the sentimental and deep anime, so if you like that kind of stuff, go for it.\
Overall: 7/10\
Not my kind of anime, yet still a really good show.\
Recommended if you like anime with deeper meaning.\

    Mushishi is definitely a masterpiece. Mainly because it is the most original anime I have ever seen. Well, of course, there are other very original animes. But to my mind, the difference is, that all those animes were later copied. The word \"copy\" might be to harsh. We could say that other animes, were created, following the same idea with more or less similarities, but I have not heard of an anime so similar to Mushishi, that you could say it is not original anymore. The scale of its uniqueness is still enormous, even if we compare it to other media. Well, you might say,\
          \
        that there are other episodic animes with weird stories and new character introduced each time. But that is not where Mushishi's originality lies. The point is in its atmosphere, the whole idea of the world, and the stories themselves. \
And those stories are my favorite part of Mushishi. To a person who hasn't watched this anime yet, I'll try to describe it. In each episode, the main character Ginko travels around the world and helps people with Mushi problems. And every story will be fascinating to everyone. Because at first look, those stories are just fun to watch. Some are goofy or hilarious, some are extremely emotional and sorrow and some just make you feel happy. But! If you try to dive into the depths of every story and understand it inside out you will find mushishi very thought provoking. Some episodes provoke thoughts quite easily, while others have the meaning hidden under heavy allegories. And that is why everyone will like Mushishi, deep philosophical problems hidden under simplicity and fun. And the range of those philosophies is pretty wide. From something as basic as connection between humans and nature to the complexity of emotions and the meaning of life and death.\
Another amazing part of Mushishi is its atmosphere. It is truly outstanding because it's so soothing and relaxing that you could just fall asleep watching it. The environment is perfectly synchronized with with ambient sounds and music creating a unique atmosphere similar to Tarcovsky's movies. The budget does not seem to be top notch, and technically speaking its mediocre. But the director's work makes it up with usury. The idea of mushis and how they look helps a lot. They blend into the entirety enhancing the soothing atmosphere with those shining, tingling, wavy creatures flying around everywhere. All this sums up and becomes a phenomenon in the world of anime art.\
Like in every episodic anime, you will meet a lot of different characters that you will forget quite easily. Besides Ginko himself there are few important characters introduced in the backstories of Ginko, but the main story, or should I say stories, are concentrated around one-time characters. They are usually created in a way to help the idea of each story. Sometimes symbolic. But we also see realistic characters in episodes where they are psychologically analyzed. But no matter what kind of character it is, when you watch Mushishi, you get really attached to them feeling their pain and sorrow, or joy and happiness. \
All in all, if you are wondering if this anime is your type. I'd say wonder no more, because Mushishi fits almost every type. Except maybe action, but to my mind, action lovers will enjoy the relaxing atmosphere as much as everyone else.\

First, I don't usually write reviews if I don't enjoy something, mainly because I know that something is simply not what I tend to enjoy.... but this is absolutely overrated anime. I have no clue how people can rate it so highly. The art is very low, to the level when you won't be able to distinguish characters. Story is very repetitive and it's not progressing anywhere. The main character is absolutely boring there is nothing special about him and it doesn't look like he would progress anywhere within 6episodes. \
The only good point that it has is probably the idea, so\
          \
        it has a good potential I would say but it's definitely no good in how it actually is. Though the same type of idea has many other animes that are composed better and having better quality of art. I can't imagine how it can outmatch Hotarubi no Morie in rating, as I wouldn't even dare to match those two together. From my view point, Moshishi is not even half as good as HnM. \
For me personally it was a huge disapointment. \

With this simple, yet deep message as the core theme, the masterpiece named Mushi-shi is presented to us as the purest form of entertainment. A lot of pieces of art and literature try too hard to get their message across through a good concept, and at times fail to do so. However, Mushi-shi delivers its message perfectly, accompanied by an excellent and perfect concept, without ever seeming desperate.\
Mushi, the entities closest to life itself, is one of the most brilliant fantasy, supernatural elements I've come across. The wonderful design and subtle motion really bring these existences to life. As neat as\
          \
        it is, this anime doesn't rely on its fantasy genre to cover for sloppy writing and polishes the elements well enough to be plausible all by itself. It is detailed, well fleshed out and its field is widely spread. As mushi are involved in different spheres of the people's lives, we get a peek into and observe these various parts of life. The phenomenon concerning the mushi and how to deal with these occurrences is explained extremely well. Nothing in it ever felt forced, but simply natural. While the element is perfect by itself and coherent to the theme of this anime, that's not all that Mushi-shi offers. Mushi-shi presents, explores and explains different Japanese folk tales, traditions, custom, legends, in short, Japanese folklores through its own unique concept. No other attempts on this has been better, as far as I've seen. Mushi-shi has many other original concepts that are unique to Mushi-shi only. These elements are nicely explained as well.\
The stories usually revolve around villages, mountains, towns and forests. With the touch of the brilliant art, these places are masterfully presented. The rivers, houses, household materials, fallen leaves, all the little details make the places seem real. And despite the stories occurring surrounding these areas, none of the setups are completely identical to each other.\
This show is episodic in nature. Although every story is mushi related, one can't really find a specific pattern or formula of the series of incidents. In other words, this anime is not repetitive and each episode provides us with new experience. While the stories are unique, they are also incredibly well written. As I always say, \"Mushi-shi is the compilation of 49 masterpieces (26 episodes+20 episodes+3 specials)\". Every episode of Mushi-shi is a life lesson and more or less a masterpiece. From the beginning to the end, every episode held on to its atmosphere, never losing a bit to fatigue. The stories are told wonderfully. The small details are highlighted carefully through conversations and actions, never falling to the level of information dump, or anything close to that. It knows when enough has been told and where to start showing. The balanced transition of dialogues and actions is excellent. The narration is done perfectly, not too much, nor too less and perfectly timed. The narrator's voice blends in nicely with the storyline, giving us an experience equivalent to hearing stories told by Grandma while sitting in a room of a small house in the rural area. This is a priceless experience. All the episodes have excellent and satisfying ends, some of which are in my top five anime ending list as \"some Mushi-shi endings\".\
Being a purely episodic show, other than the MC, Ginko and Dr. Adashino, the characters rarely appear in more than one episode. While that might seem quite a disadvantage, Mushi-shi used it to its advantage, which we get to see later on. Within this very short span, Mushi-shi fleshed out the characters wonderfully. As someone who has lived a long time in a village, I could understand and relate to the characters and was also able to discern the small yet adequate amount of differences among them. I grew care for the characters and that's what matters the most, since Mushi-shi is about their lives. Some of them even develop in this short period of screentime in a plausible way.\
The main character, Ginko is a brilliant character. What I'm about to write next didn't derive from myself but I totally agree with it. And his/her presentation is better than what I can come up with, so why not! It goes somewhat like this: \"Ginko is not the last piece of the puzzle. He's the one who will have you put together the pieces and finish the puzzle. Ginko is you\". Well, it's been a long time since I saw that statement and I only read it once so I probably didn't use the exact words he did, but this is more or less it. Ginko's past is explored enough and he had superfluous character development. Also, he isn't inhumanly perfect. He makes mistakes, he acts on instant impulses. His characteristics has its own distinctive ornaments. In fact, it is a wonder how the personalities of the mushi-shi(s) are so different from each others', their methods of dealing with the mushi phenomenons included. Their views and outlooks on matters are also varied. This shows how the group of mushi-shi(s) is not monolithic. Actually, every important character in this anime is interesting in their own ways. Some characters' behavior may seem a bit overdone or weird, but they're always in a realistic limit and most of the time justified through the concept of mushi. I may forget their names, looks and actions, but their essence will always remain strong in my mind.\
The character design for most side characters in Mushi-shi is actually quite similar, but they're never identical. Although little, there are differences in the design of each characters. That much difference is adequate in my opinion because you can't expect all the village people to be totally different from each other. It's artistic and quite realistic as well.\
The anime is not a piece of art, rather a huge collection of tremendous amount of art pieces. \"It literally uses moving artworks as its background\", is what someone I know said and I don't see any reason to disagree. The sceneries are the most beautiful I've seen in anime or anywhere else in entertainment industry. With masterful use of effects and wise choice of colors, each frame is a valuable piece of natural portrait. The excellent animation job does everything necessary to bring these sceneries to life. The slow and subtle animation deepens the tone of the moments and gets us completely absorbed into the scenario.\
This is accompanied by excellent background music played by Masuda Toshio, which blend in perfectly with the atmosphere, intensify the moods and move us subconsciously with their captivating rhythms. They don't distract the viewers, but rather engage them more into the anime. Both of the opening songs are extremely refreshing and enjoyable. Just listening to them removes your weariness. The ending themes are different for each episode with different sceneries presented with them. They are relaxing and possessive. The voice acting is realistic and amusing. The sounds that the mushi make, along with the visuals are ecstatically wonderful. The environmental sounds are equally compelling. The natural sounds alone can form the sceneries. The screenplay and audio are carefully measured and synched. The production of this anime is perfect in every way.\
Well, nothing made by man is absolutely perfect. Even the definition of 'perfection' is imperfect. But, Mushi-shi has no flaw worth mentioning. There are very few shortcomings that cannot be pointed without nitpicking. Albeit rare, there are cases when the mushi related incidents are not as explained as the others. Due to this, those occurrences seem a bit implausible and absurd. But they're far from what one can call 'sloppy writing'. Some people do complain about Ginko's attire being the only Western one, but that's not at all the point. However, it is not really illogical, given Ginko is a traveling mushi-shi. It's not really impossible that he's one of the few people who was influenced by Western fashion considering the era. And it's certainly not surprising that amongst the very few of them, Ginko is the only one seen in this anime. However, the weird thing is that no one is curious or surprised to see Ginko in such odd dresses. Again, that's not an issue for this anime.\
Mushi-shi is one of the most relaxing and refreshing experience, if not the most. It was intriguing, at times enticing, sometimes funny. Then at times depressing or melancholic. But, even in the presence of all these emotions, one feeling is always there. It is a deep, absorbing, overwhelming feeling, which in one word, is 'awe'. A feeling of respect combined with wonder. Mushi-shi is one of those few series that succeeded to convey the atmosphere perfectly. You could feel the environment relayed in each season. It's aesthetics caused me euphoria. It provided me with many forms of enjoyment mixed up magnificently.\
Mushi-shi couldn't have been made any better. It's an unique experience that cannot be compared. So far, this is the best anime I've seen and nothing came close to its level. It's a masterpiece worth 9.75 out of 10 in my current rating system, which is the highest score I've given so far. As 'perfection' goes, this is as close as it gets. Mushi-shi is highly recommended for anyone. It's my second most favorite series and my most respected work of fiction.\

    The episodes are random and have nothing to do with each other.  The main character travels to a different place in each episode, solving another mushi problem.  The anime would be more interesting if these mushi problems had some relevance to real life, but they don't.  The anime also doesn't tell us much about the main character's past or personality.  So it's neither deep in storyline nor deep in character development.  The artwork are music are also very simple.  There are better serious anime out there.  I recommend Serial Experiments: Lain, Earth Maiden Arjuna, Kino no Tabi (Kino's\
          \
        Journey), Please Save My Earth, and Now and Then, Here and There.\

    Ok i dropped this anime. Now don't Judge me cuz i already know this is a masterpiece but i simply found it too oppressive to watch.\
Story: I'll just say this the story talk about a wandering man who studies the so called mushi and help various people handling them. Every episode is auto-conclusive and i went not so far so i can't say there is a backstory. \
Arts: As far as i could see the art its really outstanding. It give you a big impact and make you \"travel in space\" its really good believe me. \
Sounds: Same story for the music and sounds they\
          \
        put you in the anime and make you feel the same feelings of the characters. \
Characters: Characters are well done, not so many cliches and they react just as they should.I have to also say that they are well builded.\
I recommend it? Yes and not. I gave this anime 1 enjoyment cuz in my personal opinion its too oppressive and heavy to watch so i just dropped it. I have to enjoy myself  while watching something not feeling so anxious, especially if i can't see a f**kn' plot in the episodes. I don't know if there is a big story later developed but i simply don't like autoconclusive animes especially if everytime i have to feel so overwhelmed. In one hand what i just said its a bad thing but in the other hand its also a good thing cuz if you like this kind of animes then you should really watch mushishi and you will enjoy the product because he do what he have to... maybe a lil' too much.  \
Overall: i gave 8. I think this is really a good anime. I don't like this type of but maybe you do. It have all you need arts, musics, characters, every episode has a good plot. You have to decide. Have a nice day guys.\

    I believe every anime fan should watch Mushishi regardless of their genre preferences. It is one of those few animes out there is done so well done that all anime fans will appreciate it. \
I usually dislike all episodic animes, getting bored very quickly. \
However, the slow pace of Mushishi instead relaxed me, and was thoroughly enjoyable.\
Recommend especially to people who are looking to unwind, and to try something new. One of the few animes over the pass few years that didn't need cliff hangers to keep me coming back for more.\
I would give it a easy 9/10.\
My biggest criticism of the anime would be\
          \
        a second season that did not delver to the same extent. \

    Mushishi is one of a kind anime, with a slow paced story, each episode has it's own plot with new characters that won't be seen again, except for the mushishi : Ginko, he travels and stops in towns to cure abnormal diseases caused by creatures called \"mushi\".\
This anime has a very nice and serene atmosphere, there is no violence, just a bit of drama, Ginko is both fascinating and enigmatic, during the show, we learn little by little about him and his past, he always tries to cure people diseases by using his large knowledge, without harming human nor mushi.\
It's interesting to discover new types\
          \
        of mushi, the consequences on concerned people, how they have been living with it, and the way it can be cured, the concept of mushi is very innovative.\
The art seems simple, colors are pale which make the characters and scenery relaxing (like Usagi Drop), it's a very enjoyable side of this anime as well as the fantastic part, you'll encounter mountain gods or mushi associated with stuff related to cultural beliefs.\
Mushishi doesn't have a main plot, but it doesn't make it annoying thanks to its theme about mushi and its peaceful ambiance, if you liked it, check out Suiiki (Waters) from the same author.\

    I know what you’re thinking, you have looked at Mushishi and heard it praised, but the premise of it just doesn’t sound too interesting. The premise is very basic and perhaps boring at first glance, but this could not be more untrue. The fact of the matter is that Mushishi is masterfully executed, in pretty much every aspect. In the world of Mushishi, small life forms exist called Mushi. The Mushi has no other purpose than to live and reproduce, which makes their interaction with the world interesting and without judgment. Since these Mushi know no empathy or emotion of any kind, the results of\
          \
        Mushi range from miraculous to catastrophic. You would think that Mushi could be exploited by humans, but the catch is that only very few people can see them. Our main Character Ginko can see these Mushi and makes his living by being a so called Mushimaster, who travels around the country (which in Mushishi is rural Japan) helping people with seemingly mysterious problems. Ginko is different from other people, in that he has white hair and only one eye. Why this is, is explained in an episode, so I won’t go further into it, but it results in him having to stay on the move as he attracts Mushi.\
Being the main character and only recurring character Ginko, as a character, has a lot on his shoulders. Luckily he performs his role masterfully. He is completely unique and he never gets old. I think I could watch a thousand episodes of Mushishi and never get tired of Ginko. Ginko focuses on his discoveries within the Mushi field, and you can genuinely tell he is fascinated by them. Despite of this Ginko always manages to help out the people to the best of his ability, while still trying to preserve the Mushi. While doing this he always remains calm, collected and respectful to those around him. Ginko is meant to be the star of the show and carry it to victory, which you might think is a lot to put on his shoulders, but he does so flawlessly. There are other new characters in each episode, but these are not nearly as interesting as Ginko and you pretty much forget about them in the next episode. This is the result of an episodic anime and it is hard to avoid, but I will not criticize it too much as Ginko himself more than makes up for it. \
Another great strength of Mushishi is how philosophical and mind-pondering it is. It raises questions such as “Is all life equal - and should it be treated as such?” and “Is there limits to how much humans should interfere with nature?”, while never giving anything but a hint of the answer forcing the viewer to think for himself. This is something I value highly in animes and movies in general, and Mushishi does it to the highest level.\
Each episode of Mushishi has its own story and premise and there are several times years between episodes, which definitely helps strengthen the mystery that solves Ginko and the Mushi. It works to Mushishi’s strength that it is an episodic anime. By not seeing every one of Ginko’s moves it feels like you are being told a story, where you get the highlights. This story is Ginko’s life as a Mushimaster. The pacing in each episode is also picture perfect. You never feel rushed into a situation. You usually get a small backstory to what is happening and then you see Ginko showing up. You are pretty much always on par with what’s happening, which is extremely important in an anime as philosophical as this one. \
All in all Mushishi is a very well executed series. The pacing is never off, Ginko is the show’s superstar and performs to the highest grade and the premise of Mushi is much more interesting than it appears on first glance. While I didn’t touch upon it great detail the art and sound are pretty average. This is not an anime to watch for its art or sound quality, but they do their job and don’t let you down.\

-\9Very interesting premise and setting\
-\9Amazing main character in Ginko\
-\9Flawless pacing\
-\9Very entertaining\

    Mushishi is an absolute masterpeice. It's a fantasy/drama unlike any you'll ever find, and it's my favorite anime.\
Each episode tells a different story. I thought I would be bothered by this, but I wasn't. This adaptation is very faithful to the source material. The characters are so well done, even when they only appear for one episode, you truly feel for them in the end.\
Mushishi evokes many different emotions while viewing it. Some episodes may have a really nice ending, while others can be really sad. The drama is top notch, and very believable, thanks to the characters and great voice acting. The beautiful background\
          \
        music amplifies these effects.\
The atmosphere of the anime (the beautiful art, serene music, compelling story) is what pulls me in with every episode. The entire experience of watching Mushishi is unbelievably calm. The more pulled in I am, the more relaxed I get. Thus, the soundtrack itself becomes a huge stress reliever~ It's almost as if I were watching it in my head as I listen; the serene nature of the anime is relayed through the music, and all those feelings I have while watching it come back to me. Listening to the OST, something I do everyday, is the best way to relieve stress. It really works wonders for the anime, especially when considering the quality of animation maintained throughout all 26 episodes.\
I have yet to see an anime series animated as beautifully as Mushishi is. Everything was so well done, you can tell they spent a lot of time translating this from the manga. The Mushi are reminiscent of the creatures you would find in a Hayao Miyazaki film, the Kodoma of Princess Mononoke perhaps. They have a certain magical aura, a mystifying presence, that makes you want to see more and more of them.\
Beautiful art/animation, brilliant use of music, with very touching/moving stories~ even with its episodic nature, where most characters only appear for a single episode. The pace of the anime is really slow and relaxed, but not to the point of being boring~ It is just right =)\
I know I can't get enough of this Mushishi~ It is an anime which should be seen by anyone who enjoys anime~ If you watch it, maybe you will feel the same as I do ^__^\

    Note: This is my first review on the site.\
STORY: \
This is not as easy to review an episodic show since there is not really much of a story. It's basically about a man name Ginko who goes around and helps people with strange beings known as Mushi. \
What are Mushi? Well, allow me to tell you. Mushi are the most basic forms of life in the world. They exist without any goals or any purposes aside from just simply \"being\". They are beyond shackles of the \"goods\" and \"evil\". Mushi can exist in countless forms and are capable of mimicking things from the natural world\
          \
        such as plants, diseases, and even phenomena like rainbows, for example.\
Despite its episodic nature, I feel like it works well with it. The stories are well different and show us what has happened to the people who are contacted to the Mushi.\
Though my only problem with the episodic nature is that sometimes the stories feel a little rushed. I have nothing wrong with any of the endings of the episodes since they do seem fit well with the situation with that certain episode.\
The story gets a 9/10\
Art:\
The art in this is one of the best points in the show. The atmosphere is breathtaking and did get you invested into its world. The character designs never bothered me to be honest. It takes awhile for you to get adjusted to them. \
The art gets a 9/10.\
Sound:\
I was not sure what to think of the sound at first but it is not that bad if you think about it. It might just be me but the opening reminds me of this song called \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\" by The Proclaimers (maybe because of the beat or that they are both catchy).\
The ending themes are all instrumental and really nice to listen to. \
The soundtrack is really outstanding and I liked all the pieces of music in the show and didn't hate a single one.\
The dub is really good. The voices seem to fit well with the characters and yeah they use the same actors sometimes, but there's nothing wrong with that. The most outstanding one is Ginko, played by Travis Willingham. I have nothing wrong the japanese version at all, it's just that I like the dub (though who knows when Aniplex will dub Mushishi Zoku Shou).\
The sound gets 10/10.\
Characters:\
Well to make it easier on myself, I will talk about Ginko, the Mushi Master. Come to think of it, the Mushi Master reminds me of Ghostbusters for some reason. \
In my opinion, he is one of the best characters I have seen in an anime. He has a certain charm to him. Since I watched this dubbed, I really liked his dub voice. I don't mind the japanese voice for him but I am just used to Travis Willingham as Ginko (though that would take a while for me if I wish to start Mushishi Zoku Shou since who knows when Aniplex will dub that).\
Ginko is an interesting character. He seems to know more about the Mushi than we do and sometimes he might not be who we expect him to be. \
The side characters had a purpose to be there and seem to be a purpose to be there. There are recurring characters but I shall not spoil them for you.\
The characters gets a 7/10.\
Enjoyment:\
I really enjoyed this show. Not at one point did I feel like I was bored. The stories kept me interested. \
There's not much I can say on my enjoyment. It gets an 8/10.\
Overall:\
This is one of the best anime I have ever seen. The atmosphere, Ginko, the soundtrack and the episodic nature is really good. Though I can understand if you don't like episodic-type shows.\
Overall, I give this show a 9/10.\
I recommend this to anyone who enjoys episodic-type shows. \

 “The glow from the light in a house during the winter is a welcome sight to creatures, beasts, mushi and humans alike.”\
Mushi are spiritual life forms that are neither plants nor animals nor microorganisms and are invisible to most humans. They have no specific reason for their existence and very little data is available on them. Although they are mostly passive, certain mushi are dangerous to humans. Mushishi (or mushi master, however you’d like to call it) are experts on mushi who travel across the country researching these mysterious creatures. \
Before I go into the story, let me start off by saying that the\
          \
        concept of mushi and their existence is brilliant. The mushi world the characters live in is spellbinding and you feel yourself being drawn into their mysterious and beautiful world. To make the viewer believe in the existence of supernatural creatures to this extent is a feat that only Pokemon has managed to achieve.\
The story of Mushishi is very simple – Every episode, Ginko goes to a new village, where he sees a person who is suffering from an illness caused by a mushi and decides to help the victim. Although all 26 episodes of this show follow the same format, it never gets boring or tiresome at any point as each episode deals with a new kind of mushi, which are intriguing to say the least. While some mushi just cause mild deafness, some mushi rip the soul out of the victim’s body. And it is up to Ginko to restore them back to normal. Although the storyline is deceptively simple, the treatment of the theme makes it gripping. Watching a doctor trying to find a cure for an unknown disease has never been this entertaining. While some cases are slow paced and have a detective-like feel to them, some are action-packed and exciting. As the series progresses, the problems get more complex and the atmosphere becomes darker. But I’ll get to that later. The way normal human sickness symptoms are linked with mushi is really well thought out.\
Mushishi is an episodic anime that consists of a set of short stories and can be watched in any random order and it would all still make sense. Each of the stories is derived from Japanese folk tales and therefore has a significant amount of detail attached to them. The plot twists and turns unpredictably and there is never a dull or predictable moment in any of the 26 episodes. Just when you think you figured out what was going on, a revelation is made out of the blue and this shatters the crux of your speculations.\
The animation is stunning to say the least. Mushishi features some of the most beautiful artwork I have ever seen. The forests and mountains are done artfully and create picturesque sceneries of rural and sub-urban Japan. The animation quality improves greatly as the show progresses. The characters look very realistic, a bit bland though. The village folk fit perfectly and they all look just how they should be. The mushi look very cool and have a spiritual aura and an unearthly feel to them. I cannot emphasize enough how wonderful the art is. \
The music takes you on an absorbing journey throughout, the oriental instrumentals adding to the charm – another success story by Toshio Masuda. Every single track is soulful, absorbing and soothing. Every episode has a different ED. And each of them is done well. The OP is an English song called “The Sore Feet Song” and is a charming piece, with a breezy acoustic guitar strumming in the background to the pleasant vocals of Ally Kerr. The background score does a wonderful job in setting the mood.\
One other thing the audio department can be really proud of is the sound effects. The wings fluttering, snow crunching, crickets chirping, leaves rustling, waves crashing and every minute sound is done to perfection. Hell, it is so detailed that you can hear the change the voice in the characters when they are talking outside and when they are talking inside an empty room, where it echoes. The voice acting is subtle and not overdone anywhere. I would recommend both the dub and the sub as they are both excellent.\
The characters in each episode are completely different, with the sole exception of Ginko. Since the characters are all villagers, they are depicted as simple illiterate farmers. In each village, there are a new set of characters, each with their own voice actors. The cast list is nearly endless because of this. Ginko’s doctor friend appears in a couple of episodes and the voice of Nui can be heard during the opening and closing narrations. \
Ginko is a very simple character. He is a very friendly and likeable person. Although not hesitant to put his life on the line for saving a patient, he is a very calm and composed (sometimes laidback) guy who has a certain teacher/professor air about him, probably because all mushi masters are basically scientists. The show does go into his past, but rarely.\
Almost episodes/arcs have a bittersweet ending, which is never loose-ended in any way. Each episode also has a satirical message, which is pretty deep and goes unnoticed unless you completely grasp the situation the characters are in. Once you manage to understand the underlying meaning of the episodes, you will find yourself marveling at the creativity and subtlety with which it was handled. The quality of the episodes remains consistent till the end. \
The feel of the show is outstanding. Since the events that take place affect only rural and middle-class Japanese, the viewer gets a wonderful insight into real Japanese culture and tradition. It even focuses on certain delicate topics such as forced arrange marriage and social exclusion. You feel yourself drifting along these tiny villages and getting a taste of their lives. While the series starts out as Ginko dealing with minor illnesses, you see him handling extremely dangerous ones in the later episodes. The already atmospheric show becomes darker and at times you feel yourself being engulfed by the power of the mushi.\
The ending of the series is not climatic in the least, but then again, you don’t watch Tom & Jerry hoping to find out whether Tom really catches Jerry do you? That being said, the episodic and slow paced nature of the show might not appeal to everyone. This is not for those who expect a trite thriller that gets your adrenaline pumping while moving towards a catastrophic culmination or a fairy tale slowly travelling towards the much awaited poetic justice. It is a journey in which you are a fellow traveler along with the mushi, mushishi and the villagers. Your experiences may not be spectacular but may linger and leave a\
long lasting image in your mind. If you liked Kino’s Journey, Natsume Yuujinchou or Haibane Renmei, then you can’t go wrong with this show.\
[ THE WRAP-UP ]\
Mushishi is one of the most unique anime out there. With an exceptionally original concept and a definitive atmosphere to it, this one is a real show-stopper. Having only one character appearing consistently in every episode, things never get repetitive. The show follows the definition of the word ‘episodic’ to the T and maintains the quality of the episodes throughout. The animation is superb and features some of the best artwork I have ever seen. The soundtrack is filled with oriental tracks that is soul stirring and the sound effects deserve special credit. It does a wonderful job in setting the mood. The OP and the EDs are fantastic as well. Once again, the formula of ‘realistic approach to a supernatural concept’ is applied and fits like a glove. Each episode is the kind of short story that you want to curl up with during a rainy afternoon or a lazy Sunday. Overall, Mushishi is the kind of anime that I would pick up after a couple of years and fall in love with it all over again. There really is no reason that this anime deserves anything less than a 10.\
~As always, feedback of any form is appreciated. Thanks you for your time ^^ ! ~\

    Story - An episodic masterpiece, a real delight. This was one of the most intriguing stories i have seen so far in my anime watching life. It made me want to watch it twice (once in english, once in Japanese. I can say that japanese is still always better, it just feels that much more authentic).\
Anyway, its about a travelling spiritual healer of sorts. The spiritual beings he deals with are called mushi and are essentially the essence of life itself. The healer travels from place to place for various reasons following various rumours. And ends up dealing with heaps of different kinds of Mushi\
          \
        and hearing the stories attached to them. It was a clear 10/10 for me though, the ending was a little bit of a buzz kill, i can't help but feel that way.\
Art - The Art was great and the landscapes were magnificent. the mushi and the 'light vein' were fantastic features in the Art which really brought the story to life. My main complaint is that to many of the extra characters in the different villages looked pretty much the same. Was that some kind of asian joke?\
Sound - Music was very well suited and had that traditional oriental feel about it. Nice effects etc. as well.\
Character - The main character was an enigmatic one i enjoyed very much. His charisma and general manerisms were interesting to watch. It was a particularly interesting factor that they leaked the main characters history bit-by-bit throughout the series. Extra characters all had interesting stories to tell about how they had been afflicted by mushi.\
Enjoyment - this anime is a very captivating one and i was always desperate to see the next episode which rates as well-enjoyed in my books. it definatly has some great re-watch value as well.\
Overall - Great anime, nothing more need be said.\

    Nowadays the anime industry is littered with violence, sex and for some reason moe shows. It is not like this is a bad thing, in fact, there are many shows that belong to these categories that are very entertaining to watch. However, just once in a while, animes like Mushishi emerge from a world full of chaos, bringing with them a different but very much needed change of pace.\
Story: 9/10\
Mushishi records the journey of Ginko, a Mushi Master who travels across the country to help people in trouble with the Mushi. Mushi are supernatural creatures that seems to exist on a different plain entirely, and\
          \
        sometimes their lives would interfere with that of humans, causing us problems. What is different about Mushishi though, is it's episodic nature. Each episode of Mushishi contains a different plot line entirely separate from one another, and except for Ginko and a few others, all of the characters showed in a story will never be seen again. However don't be alarmed as this is exactly where the beauty of Mushishi lies. While other animes with overarching story lines just tell its single tale and then leaves you to find something else, Mushishi has many profound messages to deliver, and the audience will always have a variety of things to relate to. Furthermore, each episode is an exploration of an aspect of a certain theme in life, and as the audience join Ginko on his journeys, they also learn this and that, making the show very life like and memorable.\
Art: 9/10\
The biggest problem Mushishi has due to its nature is that sometimes characters would look similar to one another. But the true focus of Mushishi is as I mentioned above, telling the story of life, and because of that, the characters only serve as mediums to deliver you the message. The best part of Mushishi's art is instead its scenery and the Mushi themselves. If you loved the look of Mizayaki's Princess Mononoke, then you are going to enjoy Mushishi's art very much as well.\
Sound: 9/10\
The music in Mushishi is absolutely amazing and sets the mood very well. Just like the rest of the show, it is very calming and relaxing, and there are many tracks that could stand by themselves. Animes and other medias do not get me emotional very easily, but accompanied by its soundtrack Mushishi did manage to bring me to the verge of tears.\
Character: 9/10\
Like I said before, many characters in Mushishi do not return after their story is over. The person that does stay with the audience however is Ginko, the Mushi Master. Despite Ginko not being the focus of the story in most of the episodes, through his journeys we learn about his nature and the type of person that he is. To me, that is very interesting because instead of being told who he is, we slowly interpret Ginko for ourselves. And in the end, each person who watched Mushishi might have a different opinion of Ginko. Just like how in life, different people will see you differently.\
Enjoyment: 10/10\
I can't put in to words how much I enjoyed Mushishi. It's unique, it's beautiful, it's meaningful, it's memorable, it's everything I want in a good anime, no, a piece of art. Mushishi had proven to me that anime can serve as a medium to convey the profoundness of life.\
Overall: 9/10\
Even if you're not a fan of soft, relaxing shows like Mushishi, you should at least give the show a watch some time before you kick the bucket. It is an experience that I believe that everyone should go through, and I guarantee that if you give it a chance, you will not regret watching it.\

    A wonderful anime all around.  The entire show has a feeling of calm serenity about it and is extremely relaxing.  \
The music and art style of the anime blend seamlessly.  It is truly a beautiful work to look at.  Now this is a slower anime so the animation quality is kept quite high throughout the series.  Additionally alot of the music is purely instrumentals that blend into the background.\
Now this anime does take up an episodic approach, meaning that each episode starts from scratch for the most part with a different situation coming up at the beginning and generally being\
          \
        resolved by the end.  Rinse wash repeat.  This is not the type of show that is meant to be binge watched, there is no overarching story.  One should watch this show when they want to relax and watch something peaceful.\
Basic Idea: There exist spirits that live alongside us and interact with us throughout our daily lives and we have no perception of them.  For better or worse these spirits go about their business and some cause problems when they interact with humans.  Our protagonist is a Mushi master and can see these spirits.  He goes about helping people throughout the land with these problems that arise. \

    -SPOILERS WILL BE AVOIDED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, SO ANY MINOR SPOILERS ARE UNINTENTIONAL-\
(This is my first review on MAL, any criticism is appreciated)\
Mushishi is one the most unique anime ever created. The Drama and Adventure is second to none, and it is a overall beautiful series. There is a thin line between a good episodic anime, and a bad one. Mushishi is by far one of the best, and will be for eternity.\
Story-10:\
As previously mentioned, Mushishi is an episodic show, and each episode has a condensed story with a beginning, middle, and an end. Each story usually revolves around some sort of Mushi-a spiritual\
          \
        creature that simply lives, with no other purpose in life to fulfill; the most basic form of life-, and how it's affecting a certain character. The thing that sets Mushishi apart from other episode anime is that each episode is better than the last. For example, if you (hypothetically) thought that episode 12 was the best, as soon as you watch the next one, your mind will change, and using our example, your favorite episode would now be episode 13. And that's the beauty of Mushishi, although the formula never really changes, you will never, ever be bored.\
Art/Animation-9:\
So imagine that you were watching this in 2006 and seeing the animation of Mushishi. Your mind could potentially be blown. The animation is not necessarily fast, and the art isn't colorful. However visually, Mushishi is extremely realistic. The slow but particular animation, the beautiful landscapes, Mushishi is fantastic in the visual department. Each background is drawn to the utmost of detail, and the wind blowing the leaves all over the screen, the characters moving in a very human-like fashion,  it`s just gives it the sense of realism that so little shows can achieve today. There is one problem however, and that is that all of the character models are drawn in almost exactly the same way. Ginko is one of the only recognizable characters, and even he looks very similar to everyone else. Now I`m not sure if it was a problem in the manga or if it was the anime producers but it can be somewhat distracting and difficult to distinguish between characters visually, which is sad because many of the characters have wonderful personality and development (which I will get into later). In short, it doesn't measure up to the art and animation of some newer shows, but it still is far above average.\
Sound-10:\
My feelings towards the soundtrack for Mushishi can be summed up in one word; beautiful. (I'll be using that word a lot, so be prepared) Each track of the OST is composed so wonderfully, adding atmosphere yet also directing your attention to the music. The Opening is slow paced yet pleasant, a very calming song to a very calming anime. The ending changes with each episode, yet they are all so outstanding, I sit through the credits every single  time just to hear the outstanding tracks. The voice actors are outstanding, but more on that later. What more can I say? I listen to the Mushishi soundtrack every single day, it's just so incredibly calming.\
Character-10:\
In terms of character design, there is a issue, being that almost all of the characters aside from the main character, Ginko, look alike. However this is made up tenfold once the character's personality is revealed. The characters in many of the stories of Mushishi get more development in a single episode of screen time than many characters get in an entire series. As for the voice actors. Never has there been a show that I can say has better voice acting than Mushishi. There are many child characters in the series, and unlike many other franchises, the children are voiced by children, and it just sound so natural. Ginko's voice actor is also outstanding. Now on the topic of Ginko; he is one of the best male leads in anime history, or at least one of my favorites. His back story is wonderful, yet tragic. (without spoiling anything). And he has a very likable personality. The characters of Mushishi are among some of the best I've ever seen.\
Enjoyment and Recommendation-10:\
Based on this review, I think it's not hard to tell that I like Mushishi immensely. However, Mushishi is definitely NOT for everyone. If you like action-packed shows, or overarching (complex or not) plots, and slice of life, episode adventure do not, then I don't think that you'll like it. But, I still think that everyone should at least watch around 3 episodes before making a final decision. Who knows? you might just like it as much as I did.\
Overall-10:\
Mushishi is one of my all-time favorites, and what i consider to be one of the greatest shows of all time.\

    Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this series enough to keep watching, especially since I've seen enough anime where characters can \"see things others can't.\" The main character was a bit interesting, but the flow of each episode was too slow, making me almost fall asleep until something suddenly happened at the end. I can see that this show isn't for everyone, but it can be watched casually by anyone since each episode is individual. But since I can't stand the lack of interesting characters or plot, I couldn't be bothered to keep watching.  \

    Mushishi was such a great experience, so I'd like to take the time to write a review for it.\
Story: Even though each episode is stand-alone, the amount of content and the depth in each episode could inspire a whole series. The whole series is very slow, but it does not drag; it takes its time, really allowing you to enjoy each scenario and contemplate the message.\
Art: Beautiful background shots that look like they came out of a museum. The characters (besides the main) tend to look like each other, but that could be deliberate (people are more connected or alike than they think). The mushi\
          \
        all had clever designs, and were fun to watch.\
Sound: A really lovely opening song. I didn't mind sitting through it (and I normally skip the openers). The background music was simple, but conveyed the feeling each episode was meant to. I watched the dub, and I think Travis Willingham was a great choice for Ginko; he has a soft, soothing voice that isn't flat or monotone.\
Character: The main character, Ginko, was a great example of how a character can be subdued but not boring. His gentle actions really set the tone for the whole show. Every supporting character had distinct personalities, and made each episode lively.\
Overall: A great show for relaxing. I loved the show for its gentle nature, and lovely art. Such a beautiful show should be enjoyed by everyone.\
TL:DR 5 words/phrases to describe Mushishi:\
beautiful, calm, supernatural, moral choices, relaxing\

    I just couldn't rate Mushishi any less than a solid ten.\
Everything about this anime was beautiful. To the sound, characters, art, and most of all the story. You need to be reassembly mature to watch this anime, otherwise it will simply seem boring. Just three episodes convinced me that this was going to be an enjoyable watch.\
After each episode I was filled with a sense of peace. No edge of seat thrillers or cliff-hangers, just peaceful story. Since each episode was a different story with only one reoccurring character, they always wrapped up nicely with an overall message at the end of them. Ginko's character\
          \
        was perfect for the lead, with his general outlook and wisdom guiding through each episode. \
I will warn though, this anime is not for the weak stomached. Some of the imagery can be sickening to the stomach, although not intensely graphic. My brother couldn't stand the sight of some, but then again he has a abnormally weak stomach. Otherwise, the animation is fantastic with amazing scenery. Every petal, every blade of grass was beautifully done.\
In order to really enjoy this story, you do need a mature outlook on life itself. Either experienced life's struggles or seen it with your own eyes, Mushishi will be boring if you do not have these outlooks. \
I strongly recommend Mushishi for those who love a beautiful, sometimes bittersweet and peaceful story; that will fill you with a kind of warmth that I haven't experienced with any other anime. \
A solid 10/10 from me. \

    The pace is very slow and relaxing. Mushi, which in any other anime would be something which the main character has to defeat, are in this anime a part of nature, something which you can't fight against. Similar to weather, natural disasters and mosquitoes it's something we have to adapt to and learn to live with. In this anime we meet both people who learns to adapt and those who don't. Some episodes have happy endings and others have sad ones.\
Each episodes have a connection to real life problems, in this anime they take the form of Mushi, but if you think one step longer\
          \
        you can see it's about things like Alzheimer, loosing dear ones, dysfunctional senses and so on.\
Although there is a main character he don't take up much space. There is no character development on his part during the series. The focus is on the people he meets, he helps them grow and make decisions. He tries to lead them the right way, though he is not always successful.\
The sceneries in this anime is just amazing, it's rural cities in the mountains and by the sea. The people live in small houses with open fireplaces. You can see that the author know a lot about old Japanese culture. There is a lot of interesting old gear and tools with much detail.\
The music and sounds fit perfectly to the anime it's quiet and calm, perfect to watch before going to bed and then reflect upon until you fall asleep.\

    Mushi-shi.\
This isn't an anime series like many others, the closest to describe it would be a Studio Ghibli movie in serial form, perhaps. It is comparable there, in the ethereal and inventive and spiritual nature of the plot, which centers on the beings called mushi, and those who study them, more specifically, Ginko, a man that always seems out of place compared with everyone else.\
While every character in this series, other Mushi-Shi included, usually dresses in classic traditional japanese attire, he seems to wear western shirts and clothing. While the character designs of every other character is apparently made to look as down to earth\
          \
        and, well, realist, as possible - while definitely not lacking a certain charme and beauty, indeed , I found them an extremely nice change of pace from all those ridiculously colored punk hairdos you see so often in other anime that they totally lost any kind of rareness appeal to me - Ginko has green eyes and white hair.\
However, most of the time, Mushi-shi puts the humans into the center spot of the plot, even though everything is connected to the Mushi, it's all about human plights and people's reactions to them. Sometimes with rage and fear, sometimes more gently, but either way, the only one seemingly unaffected seems to be Ginko, altough even he is portrayed as a genuine human being with his faults and sometimes his emotions overpower him as well, although he seems like a serene wise most of the time.\
The art in Mushi-shi is barely comparable. And not just the visuals, it ties together with the sound, the chiming, eerie music that usually plays when mushi-shi appear, the long camera pans and scenes that simply showcase the silent landscape and nature, and the visual effects, especially, again, when the mushi appear.\
As previously mentioned the character designs seem simple, but each person is different enough not to be confused with any other, and although black hair and a certain look prevails, that's intended to showcase that yes, this is indeed ancient japan, not out of a lack of creativity. \
The individual episodic plots are quite nice, the only downside to it all is, of course, that you do  not have an overarching story, except perhaps how you get a closer and more succinct picture of Ginko's character and heritage. The greatest part of it is definitely the multitude of different mushi, and especially the way they are presented: From the point of view of a society that studies them, it is never said: This is how it is, and those you saw are exactly all mushi that exist, on the contrary, it summons a vivid idea of billions and billions of mushi that exist in Mushi-Shi's world but simply have not appeared, and although the focus is on Ginko, it also showcases a few other Mushi-Shi, all seemingly weird, special and unique. It even has some interesting ideas about how an organisation like theirs could work, being without apparent hierarchy and all.\
But the most important thing - and the one that made me compare it to Studio Ghibli, besides the fun and amorphous spirits that oh so frequently feature there - is the fact that you really feel: Someone put all his love into this work. Every single scene seems to tell me this, the charming characters, who are all too human with their problems and their reactions, the ethereal mushi, the landscape: It all seems to be crafted with utmost care.\
The slow english intro theme is just as unique, and seems to express the mood of Mushi-Shi perfectly:\
Slightly melancholic, filled with love, speaking of long journeys and the small but very important moments of peace and happiness that make life worthwhile.\
I could probably write pages more of praise of this, in one way or ther other, but in brief:\
This is the stuff that makes me realise why I like to watch anime so much.\

    Mushishi does not march toward some sort of conclusion or final purpose. Much like it's main character, Ginko, the anime merely drifts around, dispensing bits of wisdom and wonder. It is an almost zen-like meditation on the mystical unseen natural world and holds many parallels to our own lives, as it deals mainly in the unanswered and mysterious questions that we all find ourselves asking in life. It excels at acute observations on the state of humanity and revels in our lack of understanding. Most importantly, it romanticizes the things that we do not understand and creates a new language to describe it's nature. This\
          \
        language is the Mushi, an unseen force which holds great mystical power. This series plays out like a sort of collection of folk tales concerning the Mushi, centered around a sort of sage who helps people with their problems as he wanders the Japanese countryside. It is quite slow and is probably not for everyone, but if you have patience and a sense of wonder about the natural world, you will almost certainly gain something from this.\
\9This anime is beautifully drawn. Taking place mainly in the forest and small villages, the show contains an unfathomable amount of painstakingly painted backgrounds. You don't really notice how beautiful it is after a few episodes, but the fact that there is never a significant dip in quality to call your attention to it is impressive in itself. Characters are a bit more generic looking. Because this anime is meant to have an aesthetic quality similar to that of a restrained traditional Japanese painting, there is no overt craziness in the character's designs. They all have dark hair, wear traditional Japanese garb, and life in modest homes. What distant visual flare there is comes from the atmospheric and believable settings that the show dwells in. The caves of a tunneling Mushi, a foggy sea, a field set ablaze, and an inescapable bamboo forest are all brilliantly infused with personality and a sense of realness that is uncommon in animation. The Mushi themselves are also highly creative at times.\
\9The series score is done by Toshio Masuda, also the composer for Naruto. The music here is restrained and has an almost improvisational feel to it. Each episode has it's own piece of accompanying music, which is nice, however many of them sound the same. Repetition also sinks in when the few other pieces, like the one used when Ginko is describing a Mushi, are used EVERY episode. I will say though, the opening theme, \"Sore Feet Song\" is absolutely amazing. It conveys the feel of the show perfectly and for all 26 episodes, I never skipped through it. It prepares you perfectly for the quiet and contemplative experience you are about to have.\
\9Mushishi, as I said earlier, dispenses bits of wisdom about the age-old relationship between mankind and nature. The story, if you wish to call it that, is all about different people and their experiences with the unknown and the unexplainable. The show never really makes any assertions on good vs evil, right vs wrong, etc. Instead, it makes simple observations about the things that exist in nature and twists them into bizarre phenomena. For example, it details the experience of closing your eyelids vs truly not seeing or actually finding the end of a rainbow. Although there is peril in many of these stories, they are usually resolved through natural and logical means. If there is one overarching message, it is that things simply are. Trying to control what simply is is a futile exercise. In this way, the series draws similarities to the Zen Buddhist outlook on life and existence. This show is, in-fact, as close to a meditation as any piece of popular entertainment I have seen. \
\9So what is wrong with the show then? As I just said, this show succeeds brilliantly as a meditation. However, It fares less well in terms of entertainment. Despite the show being beautifully done, If you know what the conflict and resolution is going to be going into each episode, you kind of lose interest. In each episode, you know after a certain point that there will be a problem which at first seems unexplainable, it will be explained as being the work of Mushi, there will be some way to fix it, and everyone will go home. Although there are deviations from this outline, they are somewhat rare. The real reason to keep watching is not to see what happens so much as it is to see what there will be. The scenarios and settings are sufficiently interesting and beautiful to keep you wanting to return to this world. However, you may become fatigued, as I did, and take a break for some more straight-forward entertainment. \

    Mushishi and a manga by Yuki Urushibara, containing 10 volumes and an anime adaptation with 26 episodes, produced by the studio Artland.\
Mushishi has nice effects, great BGM's, not to mention its splendid history and incredible.\
Mushi are creatures invisible to human eyes, except for some people called Mushishi. These creatures for some, are harmless and are just trying to live with all beings, but they are always involved in strange facts, without explanation.\
Ginko, the series protagonist, is a Mushishi.\
People who can see these beings, and walk from place to place solving cases where the Mushi are involved, for people who are inexplicable.\
Due to an accident he\
          \
        had with a Mushi on his childhood, he has the green eyes and white hair. His personality and relaxed, and does not clearly show their emotions.\
The characters of the series, each episode is totally new, except some characters appear more than once because each episode is unique in its history and its end it.\
For some it may be tedious, since it does not follow a chronology of events but did not and why the anime \"lost\" for others. He holds your attention with its light environment, their musical themes surprising, amazing and interesting stories. This was the only anime that could be better than Bakemonogatari, in my opinion, it was one of my best anime he lost position to Mushishi.\
The opening theme: The Sore Feet Song by Ally Kerr sung a song is relaxing, calm, which combines perfectly with the anime. Without many details, just shows the nature where they found many cases of people who had contact with Mushi.\
In each episode the endings are new, without any presentation of characters and environment, with only a soundtrack accompanied by credits. Only at that point the studio could have worked a little more.\
If you have not seen Mushishi, is hoping to start today? This is an anime which certainly is historic.\

Story (9)\
The story is nonexistent it has backstory but not all that much. The travels of Ginko are all over the place, but that is also a good thing in my opinion.I like how you get to know the character by how he (try to) solve the problems of  the people he encounters.\
It has some thrilling parts in it. But this anime was mostly a calming experience for me. What I also like is that with the end of most episodes you get to hear about what happened after Ginko left. Sometimes it is a few months and in some cases years. It really\
          \
        adds to the episodes. The only nitpicky thing I have is that I would've liked more backstory of the main character (even though we already had some). \
Art (8)\
I really loved this artstyle and animation. Not only does it fit the anime, but it also stood out at many parts in my opinion. For example I really liked the effects of the glowing mushi that make their first appearance in episode one. But it isn't only limited to them of course, in my opinion most mushi related animation stood out. The nitpick I have at the art is character design of the people Ginko helps. I was confused at first because some of the characters look identical sometimes from characters you have already seen. And for some reason it bothered me.\
Sound (8)\
The OST from this anime is (how I see it) calming and full of mystery. It's not a soundtrack that I would listen to apart from the anime, but then again I don't do that for almost every anime I watch. The only exception for me is the opening of this anime, because I think it was really good.\
[spoiler=op][yt]AapZE-LHUdI[/yt][/spoiler]\
Character (9)\
I think this part (some character designs aside) that this was one of the best parts of the anime. I think that because the characters were (personality wise) really unique. I really like that part because most characters you don't see again in the anime. But even though you see them only one episode you want to root for them hoping that it will end well for those characters. And not only that but also the backstories of those characters were in my opinion worked out really well. Again you mostly don't see them again so I think they've done a good job. And then the main character I just like that character, the backstory is that was there was really well done and I like how he solved the problems of the people he encountered throughout the anime. The only thing I would've liked to see is more of Ginko's backstory and I also would've like to see more of certain characters. \
Enjoyment (9)\
Even though it's episodic, this anime draws you in. I liked to see all those different mushi. I wanted to see problems solved, and for me it did. I didn't see much comedy but in my opinion it didn't need to. It has a variety of dramatic moments, feel good moments and moments to just be impressed by how good it looked.\

    Mushishi is an anime that has an episodic structure and a higher-level action is missing. be Much More Pulls like a thread through the episodes the phenomenon Mushi and the exploration of these - with each episode one penetrates deeper into this mysterious world of fantasy and mysticism.\
Ginko is traveling, usually he gets from his client mail, asking him that he may come to them or he goes to a village at random and snaps there rumors. If he is somewhere asked he goes to the house of the client and this tell them about strange events that they can not be explained. If this\
          \
        exceeds their judgment and thinking, you are looking for a Mushishi. Then briefly describes what it is and Ginko examined this case in more detail. He gives his thoughts award by which Mushi is and explains what it means to be on and covers solutions.\
Each episode stands alone as an independent story, yet sometimes we see that a certain chronology and a link between the episodes is when Ginko told about certain cases.\
So each episode is very fascinating in itself. For each episode represents a particular Mushi and each episode illustrates how strongly with those of Mushi depends people's lives together. As both influence each other. How different the Mushi-species may be. Some are neutral, some also harm people. Especially often it happens that a Mushi itself per se does no harm, because it simply exists. But mere its existence and unintentionally negative impact on the people make him seem like a plague.\
characters:\
Each character was incredibly well written. They arrived in front of a like real people and not as a fictional character drawn. Ginko is one of the best characters I know. He is intelligent, is understandable and sympathetic.\
Visually is \"Mushishi\" for me a masterpiece. Seldom does one see so stunning, detailed images of nature and everything seemed so eerily alive. The appearance of Mushi is something that a terror inspires and can hold their breath. Somehow the anime looks like a series of paintings that really makes you sink into this wonderful world. The drawing style of the figures is rather simple, but just to be realistic about it. There are no colorful, flashy colors or any things that look like cuteness, as it is known from other anime. Everything seemed so mysterious and uncanny.\
Musically, I must say, I had often quite goosebumps, especially if there were exciting places where Ginko explained something or anything weird happened, managed to build this mysterious atmosphere and the music. More often even melancholy, quiet pieces of music were played that go under your skin, especially if a story has come to an end.\
My opinion:\
Moreover Mushishi is very philosophical. He treated many subjects about which one should think.\
Can it be justified to take the life of another human being, just so there the group is going well? What's in a single life?\
And you can live with the bad conscience that another person has died for. Is it selfish to live so on?\
What is more important, his own interests, or the nature?\
As you can see is Mushishi experimenting with supernatural things, the viewer moves through the fantastic setting in its spell an anime. But just by addressing the ambivalent phenomenon \"Mushi\" and the interaction between them and the people shows that the anime mainly everyday things, crises, problems and issues dealt with, which are surrounded by supernatural elements. delve into this fantastic world to get to know more of Ginko and the Mushi, to learn more about the Japanese folk belief, but even thinking about the philosophical questions - that makes the anime from.\
I particularly wish to emphasize the story in which it comes to a Mushi, who lives at the top of the sky and a thread can be downloaded, with which he can lure his food. Accidentally woman has taken up the thread and is pulled upward. Without a statement that it is a Mushi, one would think that supernatural things were at work. Even more important to the story, however, was that the woman since then could not stay on the floor and there she moved again upward. I found the theme behind thought-provoking: The woman needs to the bottom of the facts, so to stay on earth, something she holds. It is the unconditional love of her friend, she needs so that she can stay on Earth. Are not they, they would disappear. In essence, the story was about the unconditional acceptance and love towards a person. No matter how much you will be despised by society, no matter what efforts you have to take upon themselves. The point is that you love a person, with all their faults and quirks. Then they will remain at a. It was one of the few love stories that ended well and I was very touched.\
Also something that I found very appealing, was the idea that the dead are reborn. What I would do if my mother would be born as my daughter again? Would I be happy about it or I would not have rather mixed feelings? Because no matter how you look at it, even if the daughter as an image of the mother appears, she would never replace. You could be my mother never again. Such complicated feelings towards the people that represent an incarnation of the deceased, are discussed in the story. I found the subject so far also exciting because I had not seen so often such theories about reincarnation etc. in Anime.\
As \"Mushishi\" can be philosophical and profound, I was able to prove to some stories, but there were other episodes where you have to think much. So the people had to decide whether to burn down the mountain or should starve in a story. It was not an easy decision, eventually you wanted a hand not quite sure destroy nature, but when it comes to the welfare of the community - once again - you have to make certain sacrifices. That this decision in the end but that caused even more misfortune for the people came, nobody could imagine. Here is the message that one should think through decisions and their consequences thoroughly and always, no matter how it turns out, should take responsibility. Ever have to wonder what you should consider important, his own interests or the welfare of nature? What man claims the right over the fate of nature to decide to destroy his life to his rescue again? This can be transmitted as well subject to our world, where environmental protection is more important than ever. If animals are not kept under appalling living conditions and the environment exploited, so that man has well? Okay anime is somewhat understandable, because it is about survival. But we think ahead and to the present excessive consumption society, you have to reconsider the attitude to nature critical.\

A solid youkai anime that is pleasant and relaxing to watch. It’s not exciting but it’s interesting in the nature-documentary type of way.

You don't get a sense of hurry watching this (unlike Boku dake ga Inai Machi), you enjoy every aspect and keep going steadily throughout the entire two seasons, VERY drifting story telling. Narrative is gorgeous, kinda classic Japanese storytelling.\
Each episode is independent, so it doesn't matter if you watch the 3rd episode and then watch the 1st. \
The anime itself is a supernatural type but nothing related with horror, and the way the story told educate us about Mushi (though it doesn't actually exist in\
          \
        real life)\
The artwork isn't so fancy or less engaging, but considering the type of the story, it is sufficient enough for us to enjoy.\
I have nothing to complain about this anime AT ALL, except that I want a lot more Season Series out of it.\
One last thing, I think EVERYBODY, not matter your taste of anime genre, would enjoy watching Mushishi.\

    Mushi-Shi. An episodic show with no specific plot to follow except for traveling to villages to help people.\
The story was great. It gave me a new perspective in life. To see things differently than they are. That some of the least important things have the most effect on life. With the story, there was never really something that was the same. Each episode was it's own story. Some were about life in mountains, some were about life in towns, there was one with a traveling person, and a few episodes that have Ginko's past. The art was wonderful. All the colors were vibrant. Everything looked\
          \
        awesome. Mushi-Shi is set in a different time era than the current time, and the art shows that. How everything was brighter and more alive before factories and other large buildings came. The art has all the colors in the rainbow and the shades to match. The sounds, too. It matched every scene perfectly. The ending themes also ended each episode in it's own way. The opening seemed to show that Ginko is traveling to get some place important to him. The characters were great, but most of the younger boys looked the same. They all had the same nose, eyebrows, mouth, and eyes. That got a little annoying. But Ginko comes into the scene so I didn't really care too much about it because Ginko looked totally different in a new way. I enjoyed this show a lot. It was very interesting. This show never failed to disappoint me in any way. Everything was just about flawless. Overall. This show deserves a ten. Just because it was calm, no action. Just life and how humans and other creatures interact with each other to thrive.\

    Overall - 10/10\
Mushi-shi is the only anime, i've given the full score (10) and probably the only one, i'd ever write a reviwe for, for it's the only one i truely admire. a production of this quality is very rare, and if i gave it 10, it surely is worth watching!\
the and quality of the story overpowers the very few weaknesses.\
Animation - 09/10\
fitting style, very few mistakes or errors, when needed nicely detailed, matching background colors/shadows, human anatomy/movement is drawn very good, amazing coloring \
Sound - 09/10\
very fitting character vocals, good background voice (could've been better), no annoying/unneeded noises, nice echos and side voices\
Characters\
          \
        - 10/10\
the only main character has strong, interesting and calm characteristics, which is very fitting with the atmosphere of the anime. he isn't being \"introduced\" and the viewer eventually gets to know and explore him due time and course. he's not a \"hero\", he's not the best, he's just a human, makes mistakes and learns from them, has feelings, in short he is rather real. other people are easily distinguishable, despite the fact that they mostly look alike (without all having the same boring and repeating character), specially by being in different environments. \
Story - 10/10\
Mushi-shis story is nearly error free and has no contradictions within (if not the only anime/manga, surely one of the very few). like a deep blue color, it fills one with a light feeling. \
the world that is been described here is fairly realistic,  despite the fact that it is in whole, purely imaginary. most mushi have rather natural-like existence, which makes them feel rather familiar, but still the element of surprise, which is used smoothly, gives it all a special color.\
the unlimited number of Mushi that differ in shape, color, power and function makes it impossible to get bored with them. the viewers never know what is waiting for them and what makes this even more enjoyable, is that the same applies to Ginko (the main character), in other words he's on the same ground as the viewers (this you can't find everywhere). there are no secrets, no magic and no coincidences. everything is seen the way they really are.\
Enjoyment -10/10\
since this series is not made for kids, it is not filled with cheap means of enjoyment i.e.  some wild action, some out-of-the-blue events, a trivial love story or the so called fan service, yet it is a great pleasure to watch the series. all these elements are actually at work, but in a pleasant manner and an incredible balance.\

    This is what I would call fairy tale ( or fairy tales ) for adults. For me the anime was a long-needed proof that you don't need to have insanely elaborate story-line with shallow relationships and bizarre characters to make an awesome anime.\
I would certainly recommend this for anyone who likes a little bit artistic and peaceful story. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who thinks that it takes huge explosions and people screaming their special ninja-karate-magic attacks at people.\
Most important thing to say, which occurs to me after looking at the specific review fields below:\
this anime doesn't have anything that could be any different\
          \
        from what it is. I felt that all the contributing factors make up into a very good package of entertainment.\
I found the animation rather beautiful, however, not as beautiful as I would've hoped. \
In some of the episodes I wish they would've stuck to normal animation instead of using painfully obvious 3D animations and effects. However, they didn't take away too much of the enjoyment.\
Other then that it's visually very soft and pleasant to look at. Some people might yearn after big and watery eyes but I never felt so. The characters and the atmosphere blend nearly perfectly together and neither take away attention from the other.\
Like with the animation, I felt the music sat very well together with the whole thing. It wasn't something people would rush to download I think, but it served it's very important purpose on making the whole anime nice and peaceful to watch.\
In the anime at least there actually doesn't seem to be any grand plot. It's merely a series of tales of a man dealing with mushis in various ways. One may think that this is a bad thing but personally, I thought it was nice. The makers of the anime knew what they were doing and didn't try to insert anything more complex then what was necessary.\
As for the stories per episode, I thought they were quite fun. It was interesting how they explained some myths and such with mushis. I also liked the explanations on what mushis were and why they did what they did. \
The stories in each episode were simple and very likable. They may have been a little philosophical but not in a way that's painfully obvious nor were those philosophies ever delivered by showing the ( usually ) main character on close-up saying something would-be deep. It was left for the viewer to realize in the way they wanted, if they wanted.\
There is only really two characters in the series that show up more then once. However, the people that showed up in the stories were pleasant enough with a lot of variation when it came to personality. On looks they may have all looked a bit too similar, however I didn't see this as that bad of a thing: rather have the believable looking characters that don't stand out much then have vividly designed characters that take away the attention from the story.\
The character that stood out most but still fitted very nicely with the atmosphere was obviously the main, Ginko. He is cool but not brooding ( for a change ) and does have a little story of his own that explains his history. However, the anime does not make a huge fuss about it. \
The other character that stands out only because he has a monocle is Ginko's... I want to say \"friend\"... who seems to collect things related to mushis ( something also addressed ), however save for two episodes he doesn't really do anything groundbreaking. Well, that goes for the whole anime.\
As a whole, the anime doesn't really focus on any character any more then is necessary for the story. It does not try to sell itself on characters that are really sexy, intriguing and such. Which somehow for me at least seemed to result in much more interesting characters then.\
I have already watched the series twice and no doubt I will watch it completely again. Goes very well together with a rainy summer day and a cup or two of tea.\
It's not that the anime is so incredible, it's just that it's nice and relaxing like your favorite fairy tale.\

    Setting. \
When you open up, start up, whatever Mushishi, that's the first thing that will be apparent - the main 'characters' and art complement each other perfectly to tie together a beautiful world not too far removed from our own. \"Characters?\" (I like to think) I hear you cry? But there's only the one white-haired dude? Well, there is him, Ginko as he's known, but each episode (and this series is episodic, taking on a 'monster-of-the-week' style format) introduces a new 'Mushi', a kind of bacteria-like organism that, as stated in the bio, have no other purpose than to just 'be', 'live'. \
What I liked,\
          \
        and what did strike me straight away is, even if the mushi were in the form of something terrible such as a disease, they're not 'evil'. The team did not 'cop out' so to speak, I mean these mushi just exist to live, they don't know what they're doing is destroying someone's life. And sometimes, they're just harmless lights, other times, they're a goddamn beautiful rainbow! \
I'm sorry I keep gushing about it, but the art and world-building/setting is the highlight and selling point, in my opinion of course. For example, Ginko, in his travels (there's a reason he wanders which I won't spoil, is nothing of massive concern though), wanders to a fishing village. Of course there's fisherman and a story contained in just this episode, but to me, the misty water, the weather-beaten shacks, the overcast sky with rain just waiting to pour - it's all very atmospheric and when Ginko travels to villages that have forests (my second favourite natural place IRL, only second to the ocean), and just the sunlight hardly filtering in through the canopy, secret little pools with catfish (which is a reference to japanese mythology, thank you Mr. Gaijin Goomba), well, it's an experience, almost as good as going to a hidden forest in untouched countryside out there, in the real world.\
To wrap this, the intro song ia fantastic, one of those songs you wish you could play on guitar (I'm trying!), the ending is also brilliant, and there's some action-y type music in the episodes which complement the scenes they're in. I haven't touched on character because talking about the mushi would spoil the episodes, and Ginko's character and goals are pretty much explained in the bio. But yes, a wonderful series that really shines in it's world and the atmosphere the world creates. A beautiful masterpiece. Easy 10.\

It's hard to explain why this is so good, but it just has a feel to it. Like peace. Watching it is soothing and and just feels so good. The whole anime is, for lack of a better word, smooth. The story is fascinating, the world is creative, and the anime is very unique.\

    If you're thinking of giving this anime a chance, then please, go for it. Mushi-shi is very unique and very episodic. My personal opinion to you, this is an anime that I wouldn't recommend binge watching. It's that special kind of anime that you keep tucked away for a rainy day and just pull out to watch an episode or two. If you are the kind of person who likes to see animes with a bunch of tits, explosions, autistic male MC's (see my IS review), and boooooooty shakin, then this ain't for you. \
Now, I will try to explain the anime very quickly and\
          \
        keep it short because if you want a huge review, look at the other people that put more effort into it than my lazy ass did. The anime centers around our main character named \"Ginko\" who is a mushi-shi. In this world, there are thinks called mushi that are supernatural in their own way. They can have both good and bad affects to the people, animals, and the environment around them. You go from episode to episode seeing Ginko travel to different places and try to assist those who are affected by the Mushi-shi in a bad way. There is no continuous story and each episode has their own little story with different characters and settings. \
For the settings, stories and characters in these episodes, they were done well. Nothing over the top and nothing really annoying. Some are done so well taht you even get an emotional bond to one character even tho it's only for one episode. I found the soundtracks to fit very well with the anime itself. The mushi in each episode were also very interesting in how they interacted with humans and how Ginko tries to find the solution. The art style is old fashioned but is very nice and the environments are beautiful. All-in-all, I enjoyed every episode and had no problems with it. It is a breath of fresh air after seeing the stereotypical and lackluster animes that are out currently (looking at you Shinmai Maou no Keiyakusha). And to those who dislike the fan service thrown into animes, this one has none. So you can enjoy that too. \

    Story & Characters\
In the world of Mushishi, there exists a form of life known as \"mushi\" - strange creatures that are more primitive than animal, plant or bacteria, yet are closer to the source of life than any of the former. Although only a few people can actually see the mushi, they interact with the world in bizarre ways. It is not (generally) in their natures to cause harm, but their entirely alien natures means that when human and mushi interact, neither comes off better. This has led to the rise of Mushishi - people who mediate human-mushi affairs. Ginko is one such mushishi, a\
          \
        man who is constantly traveling from village to village to study these mysterious beings and the effects they have on people, trying to help out where he can. Each episode of Mushishi follows Ginko's journeys through a world that resembles rural, medieval Japan. Although the series is episodic in nature, there are a few recurring characters besides Ginko because Ginko will occasionally return to a village to check up on the friends he has made there.\
The series is essentially a \"mushi of the day\" type of show as there seem to be an infinite variety of the creatures; no two remotely alike. However, unlike hero series where the \"monster of the day\" always ends up in a battle (with recycled footage), Ginko is not always trying to fight the mushi unless he is given a good reason to (i.e. it is deteriorating the life of the villagers.) Ginko is more of a researcher than a mushi exterminator (although the show implies most mushishi are of the latter mindset) so the mushi battle episodes are greatly interspersed with mushi investigation episodes and help keeps the series from being too repetitious or predictable. This also helps maintain the portrayal of mushi as being utterly foreign to our understandings, not as malevolant beings (with a few exceptions.) Because of this, the story remains relatively peaceful and subdued, and one that makes you think instead of one where you can tune out and watch people fighting crazy things.\
Summary: The story is simple and episodic, with each following a general formula (Ginko arrives at village, finds mushi, deals with mushi) but the variety of mushi and people that Ginko interacts with helps maintain a freshness for each episode. As the series progresses, you can see how Ginko truely cares for the people and mushi that coinhabit the world and often gets emotionally involved in events, allowing the viewer to also develop an attachment to people and events. If you're looking for something other than high-school romantic drama or fighting mechas, this is a good series to try out. Besides, with its episodic nature, you can check out a few now, see if you like it, and come back a good time later to see more if you decide to continue with the series.\
Art\
The art of Mushishi is subdued and simple in nature, which is fitting to how the series is presented. The colors are often in a dull grey/brown/green palette which helps set a somewhat somber (but not dark) nature to the show. There's not a whole lot of variety in character design (except for Ginko, with his surprising white hair and green eyes) or scenery (there are only so many ways to portray a forest or a rural village.) If it weren't for the different mushi themselves, the artwork for the scenery and people in each episode would be interchangable. However, the true variety lies in the design of the mushi. They can be glowing, floating jellyfish, or feathery birds, or a rainbow with the colors inverted, or a white bamboo in a grove of green. Each mushi's form is generally relevant to their nature, and there is plenty of variance in that.\
Summary: Simple artwork with a subdued palette, there's not a lot of variety in a rural medieval Japan setting, but the amount of different mushi help address the lack. Effective, but nothing to knock your socks off.\
Sound\
Voice acting: Sort of like the interchangability of the character art (except for recurring characters), their voices are fairly interchangable as well. Although competently done, unless you tie character art + voice + story + mushi together, it can be difficult to tell people from different episodes apart. Thankfully the few recurring characters do have distinct voices (Adashino-sensei is voiced by the well-known Yuji Ueda, who also voiced Honey and Clover's Morita, Love Hina's Keitarou and Kenshin's Sanosuke, among others.) Ginko also maintains a distinct voice, but my favorite performance was Mika Doi's Nui, who portrayed Nui as a reclusive hermit who is old before her time, yet manages to develop a deep attachment to Ginko in the short time they are together. She also does well as the narrator, using the same elderly voice that conveys authority to the narration.\
Music: The music of Mushishi is fairly quiet and simple but still very beautiful and haunting. No heavy orchestral workings in these songs - they rely more on simple piano/synth and a lot of traditional Japanese bells and chimes, which helps it maintain the medieval Japanese setting. Most of the music is slow and somber, but then most of the episodes are slow and somber. There are a few fast-paced pieces that are used when Ginko is fighting a music, but for the most part the music is soft and idyllic like the episodes. The opening song is a little ditty that sort of reminds me of a Bob Dylan piece (except the words are more easily understood) with its simple harmony and stylings. The lyrics fit the series well (it talks of traveling) but took me a little while to get used to.\
Summary: Relatively bland voice acting (with a few exceptions) but a soundtrack that really sets the stage for the story and scenery.\
Presentation\
Mushishi is a relatively simple series artistically, musically, and in the set-up of the plot, but the content of each episode, and the relationship between humans, mushi, and how Ginko deals with them can be very complex. Due to the episodic nature, it's hard to get attached to anyone except Ginko himself, but the degree to which Ginko gets attached to people and places makes you at least want to try. The episodic nature also means that you can go back and watch any episode you feel like if you found any particular village or person or mushi rather interesting. This series is suited for people who want a more thoughtful series at the expense of gorgeous art, action-packed battles, extensive character development and teenaged angst, and is aimed at a slightly more mature audience.\
There are a lot of comparisons between Mushishi and Kino no Tabi considering both are episodic series that follow a person traveling from land to land and learning about the people/nature of each place. There are some major differences between the two, which actually makes me enjoy both series better:\
Kino is the detached traveler who takes Star Trek's Prime Directive directly to heart; she almost never gets involved in a country's business, and sometimes goes out of her way to maintain her distance. Kino no Tabi is a showcase of different lands, each one with a dark and horrible twist at the end that makes you go WTF and think the author is smoking something serious. Kino's detachment allows you to view each country from an outsider's perspective and see what the locals cannot, what makes their land utterly absurd and ironic.\
Ginko is rather the opposite - he goes out of his way to help people in very place he visits, often coming back several months later to see if he had truely been able to help. He can and often does get deeply, emotionally involved in the situations he comes by, even if he knows things will not turn out the way he wants. This makes him an accessible character and one you can emphathize with, and his fascination with the mushi and their endless variety are transferred to you. With each episode, you wonder, as Ginko does, what sort of people and mushi he will encounter, and what he might be able to do to help both.\
It's refreshing to get different perspectives on world views, and I like both series because of it.\
Summary: Simple, thoughtful series. No action or angsting here. Probably why I like it so much. Am definately interested in checking out the manga.\

    Mushishi is a unique anime series. Here was my reaction at the end of every episode: \"Hmmm... Huh... Ahhhh...\" (while nodding my head with a slight smile). What kind of reaction is that? Pensive, I suppose.  \
Mushishi isn't a story that tries to blow your mind with unthinkable ideas - it's just the opposite, really. It takes simple concepts that you don't normally think about, and then portrays those ideas in clever ways that then entice you to go climb a mountain and ponder it for a while. Or take a peaceful nap. The music, imagery, and dialog is all very soothing. =]\
Every episode\
          \
        is about a really laid-back guy named Ginko, who aimlessly travels around helping people with problems involving colorful creatures that are invisible to most peoples' eyes (sometimes they're glowy insect things, or like gooey parasites, or they blend in with nature in some way, for examples). There is no over-arching plot. There is no mystery, suspense, action, romance, high-level drama, or even a lot of character development (Ginko's in every episode, but the episodes are rarely actually about him). \
While I say there's little character development, there are practically no \"stock characters\" in the entire show. All the one-shot side characters Ginko helps are truly treated as if they were real people. (That wear kimonos.) Oddly enough, at the same time everyone in Mushishi is rather... well, a normal, everyday person. This is not typical for anime, or fiction in general, to be honest - but it works. The situations everyone ends up in for every episode makes the show plenty interesting. \
Having said this, I thoroughly enjoyed this series. Some episodes are better than others (as in all animes) but overall there really isn't much I can say bad about the show. Just make sure you're in the mood for something quiet and slow-paced. For allegory, Mushishi's not a series of explosions - it's a bonsai tree. \

I have watched many, many, many anime, yet this one easily makes my top 3. \
Simply put, it's a masterpiece.  \
It took me many years to truly appreciate each anime for it's own worth, and not to compare one anime to the other. If you are also open-minded about anime, I urge you to watch Mushishi. It's episodic, so the plot line doesn't follow on from each other, but each episode is beautiful, and may even give you a feeling of peacefulness.  \
Plot; \
The story is about a wondering traveler who is known as a 'mushishi', a person whom deals with spiritual beings.\

    Mushis are primitive beings, described as the essence of life itself, basic and pure. When Mushis gather, supernatural events tend to occur. Most people can't see Mushis, but there are those that spend their entire life interacting and studying the critters. They are the Mushishi.\
Animation wise, Mushishi delivers a very different impact with its simple character designs, colored almost entirely in pastel hues. The animation, though simple, is dreamlike and fluid as it flows from one vignette to another. Through out the series, it retains a somber mood, rarely broken with action, humor or visual comedic devices.\
Mushishi unfolds as a series of individual stories revolving\
          \
        around Ginko, the white-haired, one-eyed travelling Mushishi. The series' slow pacing delivers the impression of an after-dinner storytelling session by the fire. There is no particular order to the series; each story is a one-shot deal, a bonus for those who hate episodic arcs. The mood of each episode varies with each Mushi, all beginning with the dreamy guitar strings of the opening theme (It is good to note that the series has no ending theme. It changes in every episode). Several episodes are amusing and lighthearted, some dark and sinister and others, simply thought-provoking. Behind the seemingly simple and child-like narratives that often precede each story, we are treated with glimpses of philosophy, culture and Japanese customs, all superbly done.\
An obvious disadvantage of the series is its lack of action and climax. Unlike other anime series whose episodes lead to, well, something, Mushishi does not do this. It continues on a parallel, with occasional curves and dips but does not conclude. This can take a while to get use to, but 5 episodes in, the lack of action won't matter as the engrossing storytelling takes over.\
Overall, this is one impressive anime, without the frills of excess, perfect for cold rainy days with a mug of Maggi curry at hand.\

    Mushishi is a masterpiece\
An episodic supernatural tale about a mushishi named Ginko travelling the world to solve problems caused by mushi beings that transcends the understanding of reality and possess god like powers.\
Because of this set-up each episode is unique, inviting and is executed to its fullest potential.\
Due to fact that mushi can see and interact with people but people can't interact  or see  them(except for a minority) its interesting to watch the effect they have on the human society and how some people use or abuse the power that the mushi hold. For example an island town uses a certain mushi to\
          \
        reincarnate citizens on the verge of death.\
The art in Mushishi is godly to put it simple. That being a bit of an exaggeration but they are really god. The scenery for the anime is stunning, vibrant and gives the impression that this anime is based in the early times. The character designs are rough yet mature and match the anime very well, you won’t find any moe girls or walking breast in this anime which is definitely a plus. The only flaw to the character design is the fact that basically all supporting characters look the same but this doesn’t hinder your experience as the mushi design in the stronger selling point. As stated in the synopsis mushi are depicted as beings from another world and this really shown in the art. The mushi come in all different colours and sizes with some accompanied by a mystical glow. SO to wrap it up I give the art 10/10\
The sound has been used really well. The voice actors all did a decent job in matching the characters and the protagonist was given a voice in which don’t mind hearing for 26 episodes.  The background music is matched well with the setting of the anime , you’ll be hearing the tune at the right times with causes this anime to transcend above others. \
The OP is a wonderful song that in some way matches the whole travelling aspect of this anime, the OP is also visually appealing with its water coloured paintings filling the screen. The ED is quite peculiar in the fact that it is just text with a black background for about half of it, then pictures of fauna fade in from the darkness. But what’s really peculiar about the ED is the music, there’s no vocal just instrumental with a supernatural twist but it leaves me with goose bumps and the urge to watch more of mushishi.\
All of the supporting characters in this series only stick around for one episode max with the exception of a mushi collector but despite this the guest characters of the episode get a background story with a tinge of character development and it’s not done half assed so you’ll definitely be hit in the feels to some degree every episode . The star of the show Ginko is a perfect match for the series. To put it simple he has a carefree attitude, intelligent, wise and get serious when the time calls for it. What’s nice about ginko is that he also provides some comedy relief and the timing of it is good. \
This is anime is no doubt one of my all time favourites and out of all the supernatural themed anime it stands on the top, overtaking natsume yuujinchou. Despite how much I love this anime and how good I say it is, I don’t recommend it to everyone. The anime is quite slow and when I say this I mean it feels its length. You’ll come across a lot of series that feel longer or shorter than they actually are for example how mars of destruction felt like 40 minutes then 20. Because of the slow pacing in each episode a few heads will turn.\
An anime that feels like a fairy tale\
This anime is a once in a decade series and should be given a go.\

Art: 9\
Art is a bit of\
          \
        old but I like it that way. I didnt give it 10 'coz I'm used to new animes,new ''art'',I started watching animes recently,maybe that's why . \

    I personally have never really liked anime that had a different story each episode but Mushishi was what changed my mind for a while. You get to see just plain amazing art and the voicing of both sub and dub mixed with the sounds of nature and such are so refreshing and calming. The main character is shrouded in mystery but reveals bits and peices every now and again and I just really loved watching this anime.\

    The first thing I want you to know if you choose my review, this is my favorite anime.\
-Story, is something really special to watch, we are not used to this kind of animes, with an action really special. Ginko is a mushishi and mushishis works with mushis (I dont want to spoil you anything). I cant find anything wrong with the story, in every single episode you will watch something different, and the way Ginko resolve the cases with the mushis is worth it.\
-Art, simple art, elegant, but i love it.\
-Sound, the openings are amazing and the general music is soft and relaxing, its fix\
          \
        perfect with the anime and helps a lot with the atmosphere.\
-Character, you will meet a lot of character, but you will love them. They have motives  for their actions. You can empathize with everyone. Ginko is the star of the anime, you will always know something because everything about him is a mystery. He is a quiet guy but adorable, I cant describe him, you must watch this anime.\
- Enjoyment, I saw the entire anime without knowing the time was running. And I've seen this anime twice.\
-Overall, I think this is not an anime for everyone, I am a huge fan of this kind of animes, but maybe you like other kind of anime, with action and guns (you know, that kind of things).\
All in all, a must watch.\

    \"Mushi\". They're basic lifeforms that co-exist with humans since the beginning of existence. They have no particular goal,  they either benefit nor harmful,  they're just apparitions wandering Mother Nature through no ends by imitating the meaning of \"good\" and \"evil\". \
Mushi-shi is an anime that you'll need to appreciate because of the phenomenal world-building which is beautifully crafted to admire the Mother Nature at it's purest. The world is so strikingly beautiful that the \"aura\" of the show calms the minds of the viewer, creates a sense of relaxation and that just the visuals alone. The writing of the show is extremely well-written\
          \
        with a story that could be widely versed, even with solitary moments of the show, you visualizes even huge imaginative world that is Mushi-Shi no matter how tiny or huge. \
Mushi-shi is an episodic anime so expect various of side stories. However, what makes Mushi-shi extremely unique and works as an episodic series is like what i said previously,  the world-building is vast and mythos exist in this anime. Each episode introduce a new mushi and their influence towards the unfortunately or rarely the fortunate to come across the beings. Also, each episodes provides an emotional conflict in each individual Ginko comes across. Ginko is our main character and he's a Mushi-shi,  a wise white-haired mushi exorcist who discovers and an omniscient of the mushi. Previously mentioned, each individual Ginko come across have emotional conflicts and at the end of the episode, we the viewers experience different dilemmas which coincidently, different mushi are taken part in. \
The soundtrack is so calming and relaxing sometimes mystical, mixing traditional Japanese folklore and Buddhist music. There are two opening songs and let me say, like the show, you feel the emotion and passion the world of Mushi-shi presents to the viewers, drawing in to see the absolute beauty of Mushi-shi\
Mushi-shi is a visually artistic show that you can absolutely love; the large amount of atmosphere, emotionally investing story, and intriguing dilemma the show conveys. A coming of age episodic series that is beloved and critcally acclaimed. Mushi-shi is a personal journey for us viewers to evolve and appreciate the wonders of life, even if they're downsides of life itself. It's definitely worth watching, a show you can calm your mind and feel the relaxation. Mushi-shi is truly beautiful in narrative and art form\

    The anime community hasn’t heard much from Studio Artland since the Macross era of the 80s and the epic show that is Legend of the Galactic Heroes. This new show called Mushi-Shi is based on the highly successful manga by the same name. It adapts very well by covering each chapter as an episode in the anime. This show is mellow, slow paced, relaxing, but in general a show worth taking a deep breath for.\
Mushi-Shi follows a Mushi master called Ginko. He is a soft spoken and laid back guy which always has a cigarette in his mouth (there is a reason). What is a\
          \
        Mushi master? They are people who study mysterious creatures called Mushi. These creatures are basic life forms that can exist is numerous forms be it rainbows or spores from a plant, but their only purpose seems to simply exist. Each episode follows Ginko on his journey to solve issues and rumours revolving around Mushi and to possibly learn more about not only his life, but those affected and perhaps life itself.\
As a character, the audience learns certain aspects about Ginko. We learn why he acts the way he does, why he always has that cigarette, and even why he does not stay in one place too long. Everything in the show seems to have a solid reason and purpose. The writing in each episode does vary based on the content it covers, but overall the show is solid.\
There is not much in terms of animation but when the time comes for it, not only does the show succeed but also creates wondrous works of art blending in and engrossing the viewer. Backdrops and panning art used in Mushi-Shi is a fantastic example of this sudden surge (at the time in 2005) in higher animation and art quality. Almost any still image with environmental backgrounds in the show could be used as wallpaper or art on its own. Music used throughout the show is extremely subtle, but at the same time fits the mold and mood it is going for creating a powerful sense of wonder.\
In turn, when all is combined creates this atmosphere to further enhance the show. Storytelling could not be told any better without said atmosphere being created. When winter episodes happen, the audience feels the chill and cold of the weather, or when there is sudden fear in the characters, the audience fully understands that fear as well. However, in terms of the character designs, most of them look entirely too similar to each other. Individualism is more or less taken away. However, this is probably a director’s choice to focus more on the Mushi and their effect on the show rather than how human effect anything.\
All of that aside, possible issues people could have with Mushi-Shi is the incredibly slow theme and pace of the show. That melancholy music or the subtle mono-tone voices of characters or the small amount of dialogue does create that peaceful “white-noise-esc” response that makes viewers fall asleep. It could just make this show the most boring this a person could watch or the most intriguing. Mushi-Shi is a coin flip in that sense.\
Mushi-Shi is an incredibly unique experience that many anime fans would over look today (2017) and even passed over back in 2005. With fan service and little heavy dialogue shows out there, this show greatly depends on the viewer’s taste in anime. However, this show should not be treated lightly and has that potential to become a top show for any fan.\

    A small and yet ever-so-delightful collaboration of short stories, Mushishi is a truly unforgettable viewing experience. It is perhaps the simplest anime that I have ever observed, and yet arguably it is the most profound. The show beautifully weaves together simple story-telling with masterfully scripted dialogue, and pulls it all off with such graceful artistic imagery that it just simply begs to be watched and enjoyed. \
I came away thoroughly impressed by this series, and though perhaps one could argue that this unique show, which offers no overarching plot whatsoever, could be seen as boring, I beg to differ. It is by no means a\
          \
        perfect show, but it is one that can be slowly savored and relished. I easily found it to be the exceptional and pleasurable experience that it is acclaimed to be, and I am glad that I stumbled across this hidden art piece.  \
One final note: Mushishi is not for everyone. It challenges the viewer to be patient, to be calm, to relax. In many ways, watching Mushishi is more akin to staring at a good piece of art and reflecting on it. If you do not seek that sort of gentle, soul-searching entertainment, then you will most likely not enjoy Mushishi. But give it a chance, because regardless of preferences, it's simply beautiful. \

    Mushishi Review\
Hey, guys. If the youtube comment I got this information from is accurate, did you know mushi means “vagina” in German slang?\
Well, now that I’ve finally gotten that off my chest I’m gonna take a seat, get comfy and tell you all about a fantastic anime.\
Oh, good ol’ Mushishi. Mushishi has gotten a great reputation over the ten-year era since it first aired, and the raving Ginko-bodypillow-owning fanatics such as myself aren’t blowing it out of proportion… like the way we blow on our Ginko bodypillows… \
Similar to the one the protagonist takes in the show itself, watching Mushishi feels like a grand journey.\
          \
        You embark on your adventure at the starting minutes of episode one, playing ambient music and watching a 18 year old virgin creating his first let’s play episode on repeat on your iPhone, so the aura you trudge in around you always feels mundane but also somewhat still amusing. Your good taste in music also attracts interesting characters, which all feel human, despite all being one trick ponies. And to top it all off, Studio Artland, the guys who made all the snobs jizzazzle their pants when they made Legend of the Galactic Heroes back in the day before your grandpa was watching Evangelion, is back animating all the beautiful scenery around you.\
Anyway, after I gave you that terrible and confusing intro, let’s sink our teeth into the juicy steak that is this show’s synopsis. Mushishi is a collection of episodic stories that follows a white-haired one-eyed man named Ginko-stinko-chan as he roams around historical Japan. He ponders for the meaning of these mysterious beings named vagina- I mean mushi. Mushi, no s-es needed at the end, are the lowest levels of life and are like ghosts in the way that they’re neither quite alive nor dead, but as an inkling from Splatoon would put it, “They totes do cause interruptions in the real world.” During his travels, he meets people across the land whose lives have been affected by these beings and attempts to solve their problems the best he can. \
Something that an episodic series needs to be great is an interesting world to explore. While most series explore this through evaluating the settings, laws or circumstances the places of these types of shows take place in, Mushishi builds its world by exploring what the mushi are capable of alone while not really dabbling in the previously mentioned areas. In Mushishi, people whose lives aren’t being meddled by the mushi are barely being affected. While I’d hate to, I’m going to start talking about a negative I had with the show, which is that a the world outside of Ginko’s experiences seems quite empty. No one besides the mushishi, who are only briefly shown between the show, seem to really retaliate or give a crap about these mythical beings. It’s a letdown that show’s universe is hollow, as there are a few scenes in the show that DO give us some actual worldbuilding, such as Ginko fiddling with his di-, I mean, “mushi toys” tucked away in his pant-, I mean, “toolbox” that he uses to counteract the mushi and they are genuinely some of the most memorable moments in the show. I’ll make things clearer: I’m not disappointed because the people in the show don’t begin a first world war between the mushi – I’m disappointed because the world seems too ordinary even with the mushi coexisting alongside humanity.\
Each episode follows a basic formula: Ginko meets a guy > Guy explains troubles > Ginko identifies mushi and problem > Character goes through trauma or development > Ginko saves the day or ultimately fails. This however doesn’t get stale which I’ll explain later. Thankfully, the mushi don’t lack in depth in any department, which makes the lack of worldbuilding only a teensy irk. It’s also good as it would be a sloppy shart in the pants if the show failed at executing the main thing it revolved around. Each episode introduces a new mushi that works differently and has a weirder Japanese-y name than the last, so the series never runs low on steam. They can influence their surroundings in many intriguing ways, whether that be through diminishing certain human senses, cursing objects or people or maybe even forcing whole environments or nations to go under an abrupt or dangerous change. Some bring blessings, others bring curses but a staple and good theme that Ginko brings up in the show is that the mushi aren’t really friendly or antagonistic beings, and that people should learn not to picture them as either. The amount of abilities the writers could think of to give the mushi is something quite applaudable. It’s also great that the ending of each episode all turned out a different way: some had the protagonists getting their way, some succumbed to the mushi but my favourite endings were when sometimes the flavour was bittersweet, and both sides lost a bit of something. \
Something Mushishi has a trademark for is its atmosphere and this is because of its powerful serenity. Nearly every aspect of its execution, whether it be the fantastic music (which I’ll talk about later), its enchanting scene depiction in certain areas and its relatively slow pacing all wrap together into a thick bong, ready to be enhaled to make you feel drowsy. Nothing feels out of place…\
…Except for one thing. While nearly every element that makes Mushishi makes you feel relaxed, it’s sad that the script lacks any form of subtlety. Many key events that happen through an episode, whether that be how a character is feeling, how a mushi works or how a problem is solved, is shoved into the viewer’s face. It’s a bit of a shame, as the characters in turn do lose a layer of depth as there aren’t any intricate scenes of character behaviour or small lines with expansive intent in the script which could have founded strong characterisation (see Ping Pong the Animation) and the use of show-and-don’t-tell during backstory scenes (see Cowboy Bebop) could have made the atmosphere even denser in the show if it was implemented.\
While I kinda just shat on the characters from a drop toilet in the last paragraph, I’m gonna lift them out and finally talk about and shine some light on them. Despite only sticking around for an episode, Mushishi’s characters are actually quite well fleshed out. They are all packaged with a backstory and basic motivations and you’ll feel satisfied with their growth and conclusion by the end of their arcs. The show gave an equal balance of focus to both the mushi and the characters in the same episode, so they don’t trail behind compared to the mushi. On a different point, it was sometimes intriguing to see what each character’s stance WAS on a mushi, and to see if that character welcomed their existence in the world or wanted them to piss off.\
I’ve been plotting this Ginko man in and out of this text, and you probably don’t know much about him except that he might be a 60-year-old pirate judging by my eye and hair description from before, so let’s talk about him here. Ginko is a likeable protagonist mostly for being a really cool dude, but he’s not exactly one of the best of his kind. A lot of the time he acts pretty static, and his main prevalence in the episode may just give the viewer in exposition. He does have his quirks though. He is emotionless and very calm and collected a lot of the time, but his behaviour is sometimes fascinating to watch, like hearing his opinions and beliefs about the mushi, or noticing how he sometimes worries more about the mushi during the current problem rather than the people he’s trying to save. In short, mushi to Ginko is like a waifu to an otaku except Ginko doesn’t spend hundreds of dollars on figurines. Anyway, another thing I was a tad annoyed about was that Ginko was sidelined for the mushi and the episodic characters on the pitch way too often. Sure, he had that one episode that exposed his character, that may actually be one of my favourite anime episodes of all time, but you know, that’s totally not enough or anything.  \
Let’s get to the music section. In short, it’s bloody fantastic. Actually, that summary’s a bit too rowdy-seeming to describe the music, so let’s just say it’s “earnest” (love ya, JonTron). Every song in Mushishi’s melodic arsenal is very ambient and minimalistic, with even the songs playing during the intense scenes would seem like silence to compared to something played during a fight scene in a shonen. Only a few instruments are used at a time to keep the atmospheric humidity moist. I’m terrible at naming instruments since I only type of music I listen to is the electronicy banger type, so I’ll just quote that the music is “very-Japanese-y-sounding-but-not-in-the-J-Pop-kinda-way-but-in-a-historical-Japan-kinda-way-get-what-I’m-saying?”. Also, there are episode exclusive tracks: they are wonderful.\
The artwork and animation meet the bar needed for a show like Mushishi’s and have aged well considering it aired when I was four years old. Character designs are simple and rigid, but a bit samey. The mushi look splendid at times, but a lot of the time they are just represented as generic luminescent plankton. The standout in the art department however are the backdrops of the scenes, all beautifully portraying the vastness of the Japanese countryside. They come in many varieties too, such as rainforest, beach, rainforest, rainforest, rainforest and… shit…\
So you may ask, “Does Mushishi have an explosive finale to wrap it all up? Does Ginko-chan need to carry that weight?” Well, unfortunately this is another thing that makes the first season of Mushishi the slightest bit of a downer: there is no definitive ending. While the series ends on an episode very somewhat centred on Ginko, the main character’s journey doesn’t end, he doesn’t learn the secret of the mushi and he doesn’t whimper “bang” before falling to the ground. Thankfully, Mushishi does have a second season but people did have to endure ten years for it to come, and as someone who hasn’t finished season two yet I don’t even know if it definite conclusion by the end of that. I’m glad I watched this anime last December and didn’t need have to sit the agonising wait: it’s good to be a younger anime fan sometimes.\
As something I recommend that you is that it’s a good idea to watch only one or two episodes of Mushishi a day, or you’ll start to feel the side effects similar to eating a bar of soap. While I hold this series dear to me, I will agree that it can get pretty sickening if you stomach down too much. \
So, is Mushishi worth your time you still ask? Well, I hope you weren’t a TL;DR fatass and you actually read the whole thing, because the answer’s already in there. Tuturu~ and have a hupy dey.\
…\
Oh, fine. I’ll do a summary.\
Mushishi is a classic and I believe every anime fan, whether they be an assholish snob (like me) or a shonen-tard (like… me…), should give it a go. The mushi give plenty of ideas to work with for many interesting stories, and while the side characters aren’t as memorable they certainly play their roles well. The melancholic atmosphere is also something particularly special and will make you want to fall asleep (in a good way I hope) and a grin of satisfaction will always stretch across your face as the credits of the episode you just watched begin to roll.\
Pros\
+Great atmosphere\
+Huge variety of arcs with fleshed out characters that doesn’t get old\
+Mushi are a deep concept\
+Music\
+Landscapes\
+Episode 12 (I hope this is the Ginko one guise…)\
Cons\
-World seems too ordinary…\
-Lack of subtlety in writing despite atmosphere\
-No bombastic ending\

    Why do we watch anime?\
Is it for over the top characters? Is it for convoluted, overly confusing storylines? Is it for shouted attacks and illogical power-ups? Is it for the sickly sweet Japanese concept of “kawaii”?\
I don’t think so.\
So many shows fall victim to the same old tropes and stereotypes. I watch these shows and I wonder “Why?”.\
Why do I watch anime? What is it about anime that makes it stand out as an artistic medium?\
Then I watch Mushi-Shi, and remember.\
If you only watch anime for the clichés mentioned above, then Mushi-Shi is not for you. It is not fast-paced or in your face. It\
          \
        is a meditative show that slowly steps into existence, captivating you with its beautiful world, and then quietly meandering on its way.\
I have been captivated by the enchanting world of Mushi-Shi, and I hope that some of you can find the beauty that I have.\
Story: 9/10\
The story is both the weakest and the strongest part of Mushi-Shi. There is no over-arching plot; it is simply many self-contained stories of Ginko on his travels. For this reason, some people might see it as boring or repetitive. In my opinion, these people are terribly wrong. Each episode is a complete story, and each episode is meant to be reflected on and enjoyed on its own.\
So don’t go into Mushi-Shi expecting to binge-watch 15 episodes at a time. Instead, make yourself a cup of tea, curl up on the couch, and watch one episode a night, taking the time to savor each. Make some time for Mushi-Shi, and you’ll find yourself in the company of a master storyteller.\
\
Characters: 8/10\
Only one character is featured throughout the whole series. That character is Ginko, who is a well-written character in himself. He is far from the typical, loud-mouthed hero. Ginko is quiet, reflective, and logical, traits which are far more relatable to me that those of most anime heroes. His personality fits in well with the world of Mushi-Shi and is entirely believable.\
Apart from Ginko, there are usually one or two featured characters in each episode. Though these characters have small parts to play in the grand scheme of things, most are fairly distinct and all seem human rather than caricatures of humanity. People’s emotions and reactions have a beautiful sense of realism.\
\
Art/Sound: 10/10\
Here is where Mushi-Shi really shines. From the gorgeous backgrounds to the simple (in a good sense) character designs to the meditative background music, Mushi-Shi’s production is awesome. Each place on Ginko’s travels looks entirely different with a wholly unique atmosphere. Any picture from the show could be regarded as true artwork on its own.\
The character designs might seem very simple when compared to the stunning background, but I believe that this isn’t a real problem. For one thing, the simple designs have a beauty of their own, and, for another, the animation of the characters is done so well that it’s easy to forget the simplicity. The animators seem to have taken extreme care when it comes to the expressions and movements of the characters. Since the show isn’t fraught with action, the animators have to pay special attention to small movements. The characters are always able to convey the emotions they are feeling through little changes in facial expression and body language, a real feat of animation.\
The music of Mushi-Shi is rather understated and simple, but it does a good job of keeping the viewer in the proper state of mind. I can’t say much about the music except for the fact that it is well-placed and well-suited.\
\
Enjoyment: 10/10\
I truly believe that Mushi-Shi is a masterpiece of art. Whenever I need to relax or remind myself of animation’s beauty, I turn to Mushi-Shi. Though movies like Wolf Children and movies by Miyazaki certainly rekindle my interest in anime when that flame goes out, Mushi-Shi is one of the first anime TV shows to have the same effect. This show is a piece of art that showcases all that anime can be.\

    A mindblowing, and beautiful anime series. Not very typical in terms of what most would expect from an anime, yet it has proven itself to be a masterpiece nonetheless. The pacing is slow, and there isn't a lot of action, yet it turns out to be very gripping and suspenseful nonetheless. \
Story: \
Episodic, without any type of overall link between the different encounters of the protagonist other than the protagonist himself and the occasional explanations about some of the phenomenon throughout the show (and some characters). Yet, each and ever episode contains its own individual story that all prove to be very gripping, and often\
          \
        somber. Each episode presents different characters from all around the regions Ginko travels to, and each has their own issue that is Mushi-related. Many of these stories are somewhat uplifting, yet often times very tragic and thought-provoking. The layout isn't one that I would usually be in to, yet it proves to work masterfully so. The many twists and turns the episodes take leave the viewer at the edge of their seat and constantly engaged even if the show isn't super fast-paced and action-packed.\
Art:\
The artwork is often very beautiful. The scenery is amazing and certain sequences just look incredible. Many of the human characters are hard to distinguish at times, so there is less emphasis on human faces and more so on the surroundings and Mushi. Which ultimately ends up looking good nevertheless. \
Sound: \
Good usage of sound. Lovely intro and outro music, very somber and alluring. The voice acting was very suiting for all the characters. The sound ultimately creates the type of atmosphere the show would intend for with each given situation. \
Character:\
Ginko is an amazing protagonist. A very mysterious and intelligent wanderer that truly shows how much he values life and learning. He isn't infallible, yet overcomes many obstacles with a realistic approach that doesn't leave the viewer with a huge sense of disbelief. The pragmatic ways he approaches each obstacle makes him a lot more enjoyable, and the way he perceives the world and challenges around him are at many times very compelling. Well-written character with quite a bit of depth. The other characters introduced can be very brash, other times tragic, or many other things across the spectrum which works well for each of the scenarios and situations in each episode. Most of them are also very compelling in their circumstance and have a lot to offer for the message that the episode in question is trying to convey. \
Enjoyment:\
For me, it was hugely enjoyable. Very thought-provoking and beautiful. The pacing was wonderful. I didn't find myself counting down the minutes before each episode was finished because of how engaging the show can be. Many of the episodes had me dwell on them for a good time afterwards. There are many moments that are hugely emotional, and many that are quite philosophical. \
Overall:\
Fantastic and outstanding show. A masterpiece. Wonderfully written and well-thought. A true gem in the anime world, as well as the world of entertainment in general. Whether a fan of anime or not, one could find so many reasons to adore this series and be captivated by it. \

    This anime surprised me a lot. My good friend tends to suggest a lot of anime to me, and his tastes are pretty similar to mine. But when he mentioned this anime I was rather skeptical, by the way he described it. \"X-files meets anime.\" is what he told me. Well that might freak you out too. But it's almost as simple as that. It's X-files meet a sort of feudal Japan, in an anime. That still may freak you out, well then let me explain:\
Story - 10\
The storyline of this story is kind of hard to describe, that's why my friend say 'X-Files' as\
          \
        unexplainable things happen in that show. But unlike X-Files we as viewers know what the general cause of the problem. Basically the reason behind the problems people have, which seem 'supernatural' are due to this entity called \"Mushi.\" Mushi are creatures with only a few can see, and aren't plant nor animal. Ginko (the main character) is a mushi-shi. They are like mushi doctors. They asses problems associated with the mushi, and try to fix them. Each episode has a different story, similar to that of X-Files. But Ginko is still Ginko.\
Now the reason I enjoyed a the stories, is because this isn't something you could ever think up. The Mushi cause some strange problem, which may or may not seem ordinary to us, and Ginko finds interesting and exciting ways to fix things. To put how interesting the stories are, let me put it in perspective for you; my parents find anime very strange, and are almost opposed to be watching such. When I told them about this anime, they actually watched it with me, and actually enjoyed the show, and the different stories associated with each episode.\
Art - 10\
Due to my friend's continuous complaining about certain aspects of shows, I too have become picky. But the art in this show is phenomenal. I was really happy to see that the animators seem to put in a lot of time an effort into the environments and character design. Each character, now matter how minuscule their part was, was given individual features, which could part them from the rest of the characters. But the most notable part of the art would have to be the environments.\
Sound - 10\
I'm not a big noticer of sound and music. Now I liked the music in the show, but that's just about all I can say, aside from the fact that it fit really well. The sound effects were very well done as well. Your probably asking what kind of effects could they use in an anime such as this one. Well one example is what you would hear if you were deaf. If you cover your ears you can still hear the vibrations in your head, they were able to do that in the anime, and it was very impressive.\
Character - 10\
Ginko is a very cool guy. He's a very lax, sarcastic dude, who gets serious only when he needs to be, and is rather mysterious. His background is completely unknown til later episodes, where a lot of things are explained about him. Due to Ginko's sarcastic personality he's tends to be the comic relief at some points, and due to his completely relaxed attitude, you tend to  drop a load in your pants when he says something ridiculous then explains it like a genius. But he's a very nice dude, he's very considerate, and usually doesn't take money as payment for things, but rather objects to help further his understanding of mushi, that or he'll sell the object to his doctor friend for money. xD\
Enjoyment - 10\
There is only one thing I didn't enjoy about this show: It ended. I was really happy with every episode, every story. I enjoyed it to the max, except when they stopped animating it. Everything kept me wanting more.\
Overall - 10\
Overall this anime was awesome. There need to be more like it, because it's way different than any other anime out there. If you want to try something different watch this anime. \
I was that was helpful, it was my first review. :D\

    Like most other reviewers, this anime is very hard to categorize, so i'll just simply say its a slice of life anime which is episodic in nature, and based on the travels of a mushishi called Ginko who is kind of like a traditional shaman/herbalist. The atmosphere is very surreal/melancholic and realistic at the same time, and the stories told capture that childlike imagination we all have/had at one stage of our lives. Highly recommended if you're looking for something unique and spellbinding, although the animes deeper levels would probably be wasted on the kiddies.\
The only real beef i have with it is the character\
          \
        animations. A lot of the supporting cast looks exactly like other people in the previous episodes, but if you can look past that and accept that they did it intentionally and it's not that important for the story since the characters are all in different situations and have a different personality, you will like this.\
Also, i suggest you do not marathon this one, and rather enjoy it slowly and in the right state of mind, otherwise you will waste it, because it does move quite slowly and it could turn some viewers off initially. It did for me and i dropped it the first time round, but then later on, it became one of the top 10 for me(same thing for OP, first 30 eps put me off, but for other reasons).\

    first of all there is great news for mushishi fans..there is a  ova episode and the 2nd season to this anime is on the way guys they have officially announced it ..!i cant wait!!!!!\
 i have been wanting to write a review for this masterpiece for a long time but i just didn't know what to say, the experience i got from it was something i cant put it in to words ..never the less i'll try my best! \
story- \
 is great! absolutely mind blowing ... literary  you have to see it to believe it! it takes us to a world that's\
          \
        full of amazement and wonder .. where anything and everything is possible but it doesn't mean its always good or bad.\
 the story takes place in a alternative world where nature and humans are greatly involved and twist around because of this the viewer can easily relate to any character and can think realistically. \
when a world this unique appears before you its very hard to find meaning in plot because your distracted by other things but that's where the mushishi writer is a genius because the writer kept the balance between mythical/spiritual/supernatural and realism that's what make mushishi perfect..!\
art-\
is fantastic its a perfect match for the story's theme. i fell in love with the main character in first few minutes and for me to that have happen is rare. art was very cool and relaxing also very fluid. back ground and the characters goes smoothly together as well..i am saying this because sometimes the characters are greatly drawn but the back ground is soo off  it doesn't go with the theme of the anime .. but here its superb 100%.. goes with the mood the characters are feeling.\
i have to say there are a lot of characters in this anime and it must have took real hard work to make them look so different from each other.. and seeing significant details on these characters proofs that it is magnificent. respect for the animators and art team. \
sound-  \
wow what can i say.......i love it. the song is so calm and soothing and very catching full of meaning .. you will be happy to know (because i was) its in English which is rare to find and the band pulled it off  because its still have its Asia flavor. i remember the song by heart word for word ...also the back ground music was fantastic.. its very quite (natural like with a twist) and shrine like..have beautiful bell involved melodies but suddenly when action scene or fast moving this happen it pick up like a rocket and the beat gets to you ..it was the trick to take it to next level.\
character-  \
main character ginko is the bomb he has a very amazingly inspiring perspective of life that you will come to admire soon. you will wish that you should be like him (ginko). ..\
oh.. there are so many to choose from.it is like a dessert or a candy store... which is good because there are each and every flavor that you want eat and don't want to eat. every character you see here i bet you have seen in real life. every one is different .the way they react to situations is soo unlike you will never get board. this is symbolism it says even though we are all humans each person is unique to a another no matter how much we look the same! \
enjoyment-\
okay i love it what more can i say ...i remember every episode like it is carved on my brain...i watched it in English dub...oh........it was wonderful....ginkos voice actor is mustang from FMA brotherhood!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ,,,,awwwwwww .... what more do you need... every actor did a splendid job ..when we hear it we can tell they put their heart and soul in to their work.. you will feel the passion burning through their voice... they gave soul to such beautiful characters ..i loved every second of it and i hope you love it too.. and theres more coming :3\

    Mushi-Shi is my all time favorite anime\
Story - 9\
this anime is more of an episody one... where there really isn't one plot that goes through the whole series... it's more like... each episode is a small vignette of the main character, Ginko, solving a problem with mushi. I like this part of the anime because you can watch any episode at any time and still understand it because there is no plot. I don't like it because.... well the same reason if that makes any sense. It's also a very creative idea... It's all about nature and living htings and how they interact and how\
          \
        that's bad or good. It deals with things like that... So there are no fight scenes at all.. But each episode is very calm and soothing and has a very important moral. Some episodes are a bit weird and far-fetched... but most are just amazing.\
Art - 10\
the art is absolutely beautiful. Especially landscapes.. it depicts ancient Japan and its wonderful scenery.. The mountains.. oh god.. they are so beautiful... It's just so hard to tell you all about it. you should watch it and marvel at the beautiful backgrounds.\
Sound - 10\
Masuda Toshio (who actually composed the music for naruto as well) is a GENIUS!! the music for htis series is soooo calming... It's soft and very simple.. maybe one or 2 notes and that's it but it does wonders... Listen to it when dooing homework, you will be so focused on it... Listen to it when you're trying to get to sleep but can't .... You'll fall right into a deep sleep. Listen to it when your stressed. it'll calm you down. just LISTEN TO IT!! some songs are so beautiful that it actually brings tears to my eyes no matter how many times i listen to it.\
Character - 8\
because each episode is a stand alone, they all have different characters, so you can't see any development over time in that. Not even the main character because it just shows you random snapshots of his life helping people with mushi. but the lack of character development in no way demeans the overall anime at all. \
enjoyment - 10\
everything comes together in the most dazzling anime i have ever seen. I fell in love with it. I would immerse myself into each episode and be staring at the screen by the time the end credits come on saying \"wow.... that was beautiful\" but each episode has a similar aura if you know what i mean. You can't watch too much of the show at once.. After 3-4 eps i suggest to stop because you're watching a similar pattern of events happening and each episode has a lulling effect.\

    This story is quite lovely. Each episode is pretty much closed off. You can start watching anywhere in the actual show and never really miss anything. The story doesn’t really overlap and the only real character that you need to know is Ginko. It helps keep the story straight and you don’t have to remember every little detail like when it’s a show like Durarara!!! that has a number of different main characters and secondary characters in it. The stories themselves are so cute and yet most of them have a rather sad ending or beginning that really makes you feel depressed and doesn’t help\
          \
        you feel better though. The only times I did feel better is the tiny bit of comedy that happens with Ginko and some of his friends. Ginko is sadly not explained much except for one episode in which they talk about his past but I really would like to know much more about that past.\
The whole art style is a feast for the eyes and animation almost never falters. This is a show that you would watch if you want something slow and calming as there aren’t ever fighting or hard core battle scenes. Most of the time it’s more talking and careful thinking within the story. Each background is carefully detailed, even when the show is clouded in mist, you can still see a lot of details within it. Characters seem a bit lacking at times though, some of the side profiles look a little dull and skulls seem deformed. It is just the art style though and not laziness. You can tell that they put a lot of heart into the product.\
The music is very pretty, gentle and sweet. The Background music never ever breaks the show and each story has one main song although it is hard picking out that one song out of the many. I fell in love with the Opening as it really sets a mood. I believe it is in English in both the Japanese Dub and English Dub. The dubs are also good in both English and Japanese, though I lean to the English in this. That does mean that there are a lot of voices that are reused but as I never really notice that stuff, I didn’t really care.\
This is a must see for anyone that likes slow shows but don’t touch it if you are really into fast pace Mechas. \

    I first came into contact with Mushishi through a snippet of footage seen in an AMV. I still remember that particular fraction of a second quite clearly, so striking was its' aesthetic. I won't give anything further away here.\
I watched Mushishi over the course of a fortnight. It became the thing I looked forward to in the evening and rapidly took second place out of all fictional works I have ever experienced. \
Mushishi is, as closely as I can define it, an absolutely charming collection of ghost stories. Told from an unknown point of view, it follows a single lone traveller through an old land\
          \
        - a country that has not yet seen the march of human progress, a country that could be old Japan, old Britain or old Germany, but for the language the people speak. I say this because the stories feel as though they could happen anywhere, and the people feel as though they could exist anywhere, and the landscape looks as though it could be anywhere. This 'anationalism' lends Mushishi a feeling of timelessness, and it allows each story to be told to anyone, regardless of home or way of life.\
It resembles, in some small ways, pre-Christian British and European folklore - stories about land-gods and spirits that are not human and can never be human and can never understand humans. Stories that happen to be united by a single calm, inquisitive character.\
Some of these stories, under the surface, convey a very important message, and one that cuts deep: desperation, in the form of possessiveness or hope or stubbornness, festers quickly. Others are rather more fatalistic: if you are in the wrong place at the wrong time you may suffer ill fortune that you did not deserve: what matters is how you respond to it.\
In short, Mushishi is restful. It does not tell Western stories in that it does not necessarily rely on action or drama or even interpersonal strife to drive it - in fact in several cases, it feels very much more like a documentary that just happens to catch details and events in peoples' lives in passing. It tells spiritual stories and sometimes those stories sit behind events which even now are inexplicable to most of us - a waking coma, or autism, or early blindness.\
In even-shorter: Mushishi is incredibly hard to define in that overall, despite being a story about the inhuman, it is one of the most human anime that I have ever watched. It plays in subtlety and minimalism, and tells an even more powerful story precisely because its arrangement somehow resembles real life.\

    Story:\
Most of the episodes vary in quality, some are amazing while some aren't as powerful though not necessarily bad just not as good (example:the episode about the rainbow). The effects and the purpose of the Mushi were pretty diverse which made it feel almost like a different story each episode. The show can be sometimes quite tragic, not every episode end in a good note, though I wouldn't say it's dark, it's more like the show isn't afraid to shy away from the typical happy ending.\
Animation:\
The character design could have used a bit more diversity, since every literally looked the same, I understand that it's\
          \
        pretty much the same case with most anime but everyone had practically the same haircut and facial features that some people would think hey didn't I see you last episode?, at least Ginko actually looked different, though the plain looking characters are easily forgivable because the overall quality of the animation is top notch, like the fantastic looking environment, a lot of highly detailed scenery that helps giving the show an a feeling of epicness.\
Sound:\
I watched the dubbed version which was actually quite decent, there was virtually no awkward dialogue and it the voice actors didn't sound robotic, there was some instances where the some voice actors were used repeatedly for different characters but it's not really such a big issue since most games and anime dubs abuse this even more and to be honest I'd rather have that than shit voice acting that most dubbed versions of anime have.\
The OST usually consist of subtle (and effective) guitar and piano scores, the OP was good I suppose it's a little bit too happy for the show though.\
Character:\
Ginko is a good main character he's not annoying but I felt that they could have handled his character a bit better since he doesn't really have that much of a personality, at least the show had one or two episodes dedicated to his back story which prevented Ginko from being a boring character. The show does it's best trying to make you care for the side characters during each episode, while they do a good job making you care even with the fact that the characters look practically the same.\
Overall:\
Well I have to say episodic shows are possibly the home of great anime; Aria, Kino's Journey and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (too an extent) are all episodic shows and they are definitely anime of the highest quality, these kind of shows manage to make each episode different and interesting, even as most of the time they have a recurring theme each episode, it never feels repetitive.\
Mushi-shi is definitely one of the best anime out there, it might have some faults but it has a lot more aspects that it does pretty well. it's a show that's absolutely impossible to hate, and is definitely something every anime fan needs to see.\

    Mushishi is quite frankly, a brilliant and engrossing anime that catches your attention in the oddest way possible: by being very very simple. The very beauty of Mushishi is in its simplicity. It doesn't try to catch your attention with cheap, tried and true formulas. It doesn't try so hard to be deep that it trips and falls on the slippery slope of pretentiousness. It doesn't contain squicky and gory high octane action scenes. Mushishi manages to keep your attention for all 26 episodes just by being what it is: A simple, mysterious, and beautiful anime.\
[ Story 10/10 ]\
Mushishi is an episodic anime. Each episode\
          \
        sees the main character Ginko dealing with a different person, a different mushi, and a different conflict. There are as many different types of mushi as there are people, so each supernatural  phenomena is as interesting as the last. The various characters introduced throughout the anime are just normal everyday people who's lives have been affected in some way by the mushi.\
Despite the fact the mushi can cause grief and illness to many people, Ginko stresses that the mushi aren't inherently evil. They're just trying to get by in life, much like humans are, and shouldn't be hated for it. Little comments like these could possibly be interpreted as having a deeper meaning.\
But like I stated above, Mushishi doesn't try way too hard to be deep. The story is simple yet interesting. Its very easy to keep up with and follow. There's always a new and interesting case waiting to greet both Ginko and the viewers in each episode. \
[ Characters 10/10]\
 Ginko, the main character, is the only character that appears in every episode. Over the course of the anime, aspects of his character as well as his past are slowly revealed. Ginko is very calm, slow to anger or panic, and displays a knowledge and outlook on life that betrays his young appearance. A bit of his past is revealed later in the anime, explaining how he became a mushi master and how he attained his odd, otherworldly appearance. As a main character, he's pretty likeable. The anime focuses more on the individual cases he takes on, rather than Ginko himself. \
A new batch of characters is introduced every episode. None of these character's growths or personalities are formulaic. Of course, with each episode being 30 minutes, its difficult to fit in significant character development for each character. But its interesting to see how each person changes once the episode is over. Its also interesting to see how each person reacts to the mushi they are confronted with. \
[ Art and Sound 10/10 ]\
The opening theme is a peaceful little number that perfectly suits the atmosphere of the anime. The insert songs were great as well. The animation is top notch considering its age. I found it hard to believe I was watching an anime that was a little over seven years old. Care was put into the lush and beautiful backgrounds. There isn't that much variety in the character designs, aside from Ginko. But they are far from bad, and it goes hand in hand with Mushishi's whole air of simplicity that I mentioned earlier. \
Probably the most interesting to look at are the mushi. The way the transparent, colorful little guys dance around the screen is a real treat to watch. From the cute little ones from the first episode to the creepy swamp mushi, they've all got some interesting and quirky design. The voice acting for Mushishi is another well done addition to the series many good points. Having watched the dub, I can safely assure you that its a quality one. Travis Willingham's performance as Ginko is definitely worth praise. Several voice actors appear for the different characters in each episode and they all do a great job as well. The script is devoid of any awkwardly worded translations that plague some anime. There's no over the top screaming, gratuitous cursing, or the inevitable \"EHHHH?\" (or in English \"WHAAAAAT?\") being thrown around at the drop of a hat.\
Thanks to that (and probably a good voice director), the dialogue never comes off as forced or awkward. \
[ Enjoyment 10/10 ]\
As you can tell, I enjoyed this anime a lot. It was a real treat to watch. I appreciate and praise its ability to keep my short attention span glued to the screen without any cheap gimmicks. Its a very peaceful and chill anime that I particularly enjoyed while drinking green tea after a long day at school. \
[ Overall 10/10 ]\
Overall, this is one rare gem of an anime that no one should pass up. Its very hard to find a flaw in this anime. Although I think people who want a series with a lot of action, explosions, hot chicks, and an overarching plot may not find what they are looking for in Mushishi. Mushishi just isn't that kind of anime, but its still easy to get in to and enjoy. Perhaps try watching Mushishi after you're done watching that crazy, over the top, adrenaline pumping anime like I did. You might be able to appreciate it simple yet interesting plot a lot more.\

This anime is one that I can fall asleep to at night. Sometimes that's what I actually use it for. NOT that it's boring. NOT AT ALL BORING! My reasoning for doing this is written above. \
It's such a simple anime as far as the art goes. It keeps pretty much in nature through different seasons. But the stories are far from simple. They are very thought-provoking and some even eerie. \

    Mushishi was (and is) definitely one of the most satisfying, well-thought anime series I've seen so far. The genre is both supernatural and romance, which pairs very well in a story like Mushishi's, so I would definitely recommend this to fans of supernatural beings and/or friendships between abnormal beings and humans.\
Story: 10\
Jumping straight to the story, it was excellent and deep-hearted. It actually flowed with the manga quite well with an easy-to-understand setup. Each episode contained a complex message or moral that all tied together in the end, and with the atmosphere it consented with it was very enjoyable to piece these hidden messages together.\
          \
        Although some episodes skip through entire manga arcs, the plot was well enough to efficiently satisfy me, completing its series without leaving me hanging or wondering \"What next?\" However the location, era, and origin of each character is unknown, so to first-time readers or watchers, this may be a bit confusing. For fans who are more into the hype of anime, a plot as tricky as Mushishi's will be totally unfitting.\
Art: 10\
The art and animation was beautiful and full of both warm and cool colors. I found the character designs very interesting and well-blended with the natural forest-like scenery, which served as eye candy for the most part. Mushi (the so-called \"ghosts\" in the series) were colored in different tones and hues, which ranged from relaxed and calm to fiesty and angered. As for the animation, it was extremely enjoyable to see these creatures that not even the viewer knew just floating around like plasma water in air. The characters' movements were fluent, but the camera angles were shaky and sudden at times, which subtracted little from the overall enjoyment.\
Sound: 8\
I usually don't pay much attention to sound very much, but the soundtrack was a bit unfitting along with character movements. The opening and ending was very meaningful and followed a deeper aspect of Mushishi, which made up for sound errors just a smidge.\
Character: 9\
Ginko, the main character, was an enjoyable protagonist along with some side characters. I could tell that Ginko had probably spent most of his life wandering an unknown area, studying these strange beings after an incident as a child and had a very deep interest in Mushi, while teaching those who could see Mushi about these strange beings. Most of the side characters were cliched a bit, and shared a pattern of not knowing about the Mushi, but acknowledging they were harmless creatures after Ginko came along. They all had the same reactions to the Mushi (with the exceptions of a few helping characters).\
Enjoyment/Overall: 9\
As a huge fan of paranormal/supernatural and hidden messages in the plot, I found Mushishi to be a refreshing series. The plot pacing was slow in the beginning, but adequately sped up between the last few episodes, which subtracted from the deeper side of Mushishi. Another minus for me was being a big shounen, sci-fi, and cyberpunk fan, so by gut I didn't enjoy the lack of action in this series. However, Mushishi was a beautiful series with meaningful plot, enjoyable characters, and plenty of eye candy, and always will be in my straight opinion.\
Again, I'd recommend this anime/manga to fans of supernatural beings and friendships forming \"along the way\", as the blend of romance and supernatural would make up for sound errors and character tropes.\

    So after watching a series like Attack on Titan or Gurren Lagann, Mushishi is an ever present reminder that anime basically has no boundaries and continues to be one of the reasons why I watch the medium. It's also extremely jarring because of how calm it is, seriously don't watch Mushishi if you're tired, you'll fall asleep. Mushishi though, unlike those other shows is severely out there and much calmer than the aforementioned bright colors and explosion based plots. Mushishi is a brilliant show because of how it can pull off a well written plot that raises tension and builds excitement, but in a strangely\

It presents the viewer with an ancient Japan where mushi-masters (mushishi) hold the line in our real world by helping people who have been affected by Mushi, which are creatures that bridge the gap from the natural world to the metaphysical one. The show follows Ginko, an effectively stoic protagonist and his diagnoses of Mushi affecting people throughout the country. \
Each episode tells its own story that follows this premise, but the writers of the show always find a way to make Ginko shine in the spotlight in a different way. The plot of each episode not only brings the mushi to life through their bizzare powers (to which the art for each is beautiful by the way), but the people that Ginko interacts with are a wide variety of different people, and the fact that there are so many different characters gives the show an added sense of realism to the already dream-like story. Ginko himself is interesting despite the fact that he's a stoic character, you can really see his personality shine through when he experiences fear, success, or gets irritated. The whole point of the show is simple, and it expresses how the human's wants, needs, fears and dreams don't always coexist with nature's natural cycle, and it's a very deep, introspective experience nonetheless. \
The only issue I had with the show was that even though I really enjoyed the simple premise of a variety of different problems, I wished that the viewer got more of an overarching look at everything Ginko has learned from his journeys as a mushishi, and I wished that the last few episodes actually come to some sort of conclusion that touches on this. However I'll also accept the answer of \"just watch season 2\" to feed my hope of finding the answers to my questions the show left unanswered. So if you're looking for a show that you can enjoy by yourself and maybe have some tea late at night, Mushishi will set the mood of some calming brainfood and good writing.\

    Society is obsessed with labeling things and producing like-minded offspring, and I can only venture to guess those labels are an even bigger part of culture in Japan from what I've come to \"learn\" of it (for instance bias against outsiders is a strong motive during the whole series) which makes the main character shitting on all of those labels that much more interesting. Like Aku No Hana (which is something Mushishi fans should enjoy) it's quite subtle in its narration and displays an interesting point of view on morality. Although it uses supernatural forces the outcomes of its stories are somewhat realistic in the\
          \
        sense that one side doesn't win all the time and isn't displayed as some kind of morality God-can you really blame a species for wanting to survive (there was a really cool dialogue between Ginko and Mushi on that subject actually) ? As a result every episode feels dramatic yet Ginko's ending speeches always manage to give you a sense of fulfillment no matter what side \"wins\" because victory is nowhere near the focal point of this anime. Enchanting; one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. \

    Ever get the need for an anime that is nice to watch alone, where you don't need 100% of your brain to enjoy? This is not to say that mushishi requires you to turn your brain off, instead i'd say it requires some thought, but enough to keep it at a mellow middle of brain power. It's beautiful to look at, interesting to listen to and follow and just genuine fun to watch. Though it is a more melancholy then happy, It's not enough to depress you too much, and the amazing fun and happy moments make up for a lot of the tear jerkers.\

    Wow. That is my impression upon finishing the series (at 3 o'clock in the morning, I may add). I tried to start this series online a month or two ago and just couldn't get past the 2nd episode, but I recently bought it on DVD (because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about) and was hooked from the 3rd episode on.\
Story: 10\
This is the kind of story that sneaks up on you. At first, everything seemed a bit unconnected and I wasn't sure if I liked it, but when I picked it back up, watching a few episodes a night, I realized\
          \
        what a beauty the anime really is. The story is told in an anecdotal sort of format. Rather than showing the lives of a small group of people, the story seems to be more about life itself. There is a big focus on the world and staying in harmony with the creatures that live in it, even the \"mushi\" who can only be seen by some people but can affect many. One of the nicest parts about the anime is that it's really relaxing. Sure, there are suspenseful bits, but the aura of relaxation never entirely goes away. I was never scared of any of the mushi in the show (I tend to get paranoid in the dark) because even the detrimental mushi weren't the kind that would jump out and scare me, so I was able to retain a calm mindset.\
Art: 9\
All of the art is beautiful. The story is set mostly in rural Japan during older times, so there aren't electronics and technology featured--just nature, which I think is one of the most beautiful things to look at. The only problem I found with the drawings was that many of the characters looked extremely similar--the same coloring, similar hairstyles, etc. even between genders, so it was hard to tell them apart. However, characters never really crossed storylines, and the recurring ones were given significant characteristics, so it wasn't that much of a problem.\
Sound: 10\
The soundtrack for the anime is soothing and musical. I love the opening, which reminds me of summertime and nature, and the endings are all different instrumental pieces created specifically for each episode, so the mood of each story is carried through the credits.\
Character: 10\
There are only two recurring characters that I can remember (the main character, Ginko, and the doctor in one of the fishing villages). That being said, the characters in each episode all seemed extremely human, which was refreshing. Watching an episode is like meeting a new person and catching just a glimpse of their life while simultaneously being introduced to the creatures/mushi that occur where those people live. Ginko was also fun to watch, with a likeable and sometimes funny personality, and I really enjoyed learning his backstory.\
Enjoyment: 10\
The series did feel a little unfinished at the end, but then, the beginning wasn't that significant either, so I believe it serves its purpose as just a glimpse of lives over time. \
Overall: 10\
Watch it. Yes. Please do. Especially if you're stressed or something of the like--it's not a comedy, but it makes everything feel a bit more beautiful and profound (with not a lot of thinking involved). Take the journey along with Ginko and see how even though all creatures live differently, they are all part of this wonderful thing called life.\

    It is on extremely rare cases in which I am able to give a rating of 10 to any piece of work. However, Mushishi deserves a perfect mark as it is a true master piece.\
Mushishi seeks to create a world full of wonderment. It draws the viewer in with beautiful visuals as well as beautiful sounds. The soundtrack is truly a marvel and everyone should own each and every song from the show. \
For fear of writing any spoilers, I will not delve into any part of the show. You must watch this show if you consider yourself an anime watcher at all. It will\
          \
        definitely enlighten you with the new possibilities of anime and set the bar much higher for any anime you should watch in the future.\
It is truly upsetting that there was not more. The series never received the following it deserved, as anime fans tend to flock to cheesy, loli, or purely action based series (the type of anime that Miyazaki despises).\

    I watched maybe half of this show's episodes many years ago, and left it be. Now I finally got to watch the series again, this time finishing it. I haven't seen the other adaptations yet, nor the manga.\
The anime's mood is well built, as the magical and mysterious air is in every episode. It's almost calming, in a way. For the mood alone I could watch this series again. I don't think this anime is for those who like to see a lot of action, since I'd say this is quite slow paced.\
What I didn't like about the series, is that so many of the\
          \
        characters looked too similar. Especially the small boy in episode three. He seemed to come up time and again elsewhere as the same-looking but different character. Most of the characters were not very memorable, apart from their problems. There isn't much depth to the characters' personalities, as we don't really get to know any of them. Maybe it's intentional, as the plot is so heavily centered on mushi and their behavior. Besides, introducing a new set of characters and problems in every episode isn't an easy thing to do. It would be interesting to see how this has been handled in the manga.\
Another very memorable thing for me was the music. It really stood out, and added to the eerie mood. Overall, I enjoyed Mushishi very much.\

mushishi was a nice and enjoyable anime for me, but it took me a long time to finisih it because it doesnt have a clear storyline and is more of an anime to watch before sleep (imo). i'm a big fan of ginko, i think he's compassionate, concentrated and very wise but it was impossible to bond to other characters besides him. the music was beautiful, the mushi diverse and 80% of the episodes ended in a positive way (i like good endings). the only thing that always bothered me, is\

    Before typing the review down, I just want everybody who is reading understand that rating an anime is purely subjective, but not without facts of course. We may be bias at time to defend our favorite series because ultimately, a review is a mixture of your own opinion and the facts that are lay out to you so that you can let others know what's the object/subject is about. In short, Mushi-shi is a Masterpiece (10/10) for me. Objectively, it deserves, at least, a 7 if anything, but deserves no more than a 9. It deserves, at least, a 7 because of its' innovative idea\
          \
        and concept of mushi. It's also not an anime for everybody. It's really mature and questions the very nature. Like how there are many studies of different things such as psychology, biology, Entomology, etc., this is a \"Mushiology.\" Well, technically and literally, mushi in japanese is called bugs. But in this series, Mushi-shi is actually not just bugs, but more of a wider and vague groups. Think of it as a combination of spirits/ghost, paranormal, bugs, fungal, and nature. This is what the anime is really all about, hence why it deserves no more than a 9 out of 10. It would have objectively earn itself a 10 if the main character, Ginko, was more to him, but I want to believe that Ginko was made to be plain and simply helps other out during his travel because the series strongly involves solving and understanding about Mushi and letting people who doesn't know what mushi understand that they aren't \"evil\" things and are just bound by nature to live. Like how us, human, struggle to live, the mushi too, are just struggling ways to survive. \"The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.\" quoting H.P. Lovecraft. This is what precisely what Mushi-shi tries to convey as a message to both viewers and in the story. Now, if you want to know why it is a masterpiece in my opinion, simply keeping reading from here on out.\
Story: The story isn't like an arc or the whole show, but rather each episode or two is a another different story as the main character travel areas to areas solving abnormal/paranormal problems because the main character is a Mushi-shi, which stands for \"Bug Master.\" It continues on without an end. Honestly, there is no end to this series. It could kept going on and on like a detective cases. This can be unfortunate to some people who actually wish an end to the story, and I completely understand that. But for me, a never ending story of something I like watch is a bit sad even though it should end at some point. But anyway, the reason why I like the story of how it is because from my standpoint, it's like listening to a companion's travel story and how it start and end up. Was the problem solve? Was Everyone Okay? Did you regret meeting those people? and stuff like that. Each episode felt surreal in some way, but also felt realistic. And that not all problems could go away and sometimes you just have to live with it like how our daily lives are.\
Art: Art is never my forte so perhaps, I may be more bias here than other section. I simply like the art style! There I said it! It's immersive. It's dreamy. It's spiritual. It's beautiful. It's NATURE! It's very Japanese probably because of the setting of the anime. It looks like edo time to me. perhaps even further. Ginko design character is probably the reason why you wanted to watch in the first place. Any character with white hair is an eye catcher. Unfortunately, we reach modern world where white hair guys/girls isn't uncommon anymore though.\
Sound: Calming and spiritual. I don't know what else to say. It's certainly appropriate for the anime.\
Character: Ginko may appears rather plain despite his white hair and green eye and one missing eye. Will you are half right and half wrong. You see, like many other ordinary people, Ginko in the past was an ordinary child as anyone else is. So, it make sense and does not contract his personality. But he can be humorous at time. Like everybody else in the series, Ginko is just trying to live his life. \
Enjoyment: Because it was my type of anime, I enjoy it thoroughly.\
Overall: I consider a masterpiece even if there are some flaws to it. The concept of it strikes me and I liked the pacing of the show and it story of episodic manner.\

    “The world is filled with life unknown to man.”\
This statement holds deep meaning in this anime, Mushishi. Mushishi is a masterpiece. I cannot find anything like it. \
Mushishi is very relaxing to watch, though there are times when it gives you a twinge on the heart. It is light and enjoyable. I couldn’t stop watching one episode and another. The stories in each episode are varied and well-written. It gives happiness and sadness or both at the same time. \
One of the things I like in this anime is that you couldn’t predict what happens next. It’s not the same as some animes in\
          \
        which you already know how things end up. If you watch this, you’ll be exposed to a world completely unknown. It makes you wonder and anticipate what happens. Your curiosity will be picked on and on. At the end, I was even yearning for more and more mystery. It’s deep I tell you.\
The stories revolves on how two species co-exist, how humans live with the presence of Mushi’s and how their lives are affected by Mushi’s.\
Each episode depicts Ginko’s encounter with Mushi’s. Ginko, the main protagonist, is a likeable character. His character fits well with his job. But note, there is more to him than what you see. \
The background music is also quite fitting to the atmosphere of the anime. \
One word is all it takes to make any anime worthy to be watched: interesting. It’s simple. If you think it’s interesting, then watch. If not, then don’t. It all boils down in asking yourself: Is it interesting enough to make me watch it? \
So? Is it worth it? \
Yes, absolutely. I love it. What makes this show interesting is that the mysteries of another life are unveiled in a very subtle yet profound manner. \

    This isn't really a review but more like an overview of teh anime, no spoilers but not much details either, focusing on only the 1st season.\
\"Mushi\": the most basic forms of life in the world. Detailed information on Mushi is scarce because the majority of humans are unaware of their existence.\
Mushi-shi are those who research Mushi in hopes of understanding their place in the world's hierarchy of life.\
Throughout his journey, Ginko, the Mushi-shi travels around the world and helps people dealing with mushi, that the people tend to think of as curses and diseases since most can't see or feel them. Ginko's journey is divided\
          \
        into short stories, a story every episodes. The episodes might be considered as standalone but a background story is going on somewhere. (probably during season 2 and 3, which I'm not covering) The short stories are very well made, narration makes it even better, there's narration at the start of the episode and at the end. Every episode starts with people having troubles with an illness then Ginko appears and help them get rid of it by chasing out the mushi, in most cases. The whole anime is like a compilation of short stories, so, progress is slow and the pace is monotone but it's still very enjoyable if you're patient enough.\
Ginko is one of my facvorite characters, very cool and composed, not sharing anythign about his past since he doesn't know much about himself either. And the voice actor did a great job in reflecting Ginko's personality through his voice, it's just perfect. I really loved the music, it made feel the suspence while in a dark forest, joy when the people are happy and sadness when someone passes away, and music + narration was just a perfect mix, very well done.\
The show isn't very dynamic so I don't recommend it to the people that seek action and development.\
But if you're looking for a calming and relaxing experience, enjoy the strory telling and follow what happens because I find it beautiful, and I found myself thinking about creation, the universe, world and also... the invisible at times while watching. Such anime won't make you excited as much as it'll make you think, which I find it good for a change.\

    Mushishi is the absolute pinnacle of subtle storytelling. Using a genius formula to tell its stories, Mushishi provides theme after theme in an interesting and serene way. As we follow one of the only continuous characters in the show, Ginko provides a unique vehicle for these fantastic tales. Rarely is there a show where every episode is capable of carrying its own weight. However, that is exactly what Mushishi manages to do for 26 straight episodes.\
Story:\
Mushishi is without a doubt the best succession of stories i have seen told in any medium of entertainment. The very nature of the way Mushishi tells its stories create\
          \
        an aura around every new problem, as well as character, that Ginko meets. As he travels; diagnosing, studying, and treating problems caused by mischievous mushi, we're introduced to numerous unique stories and the real characters living them. Trying to avoid spoilers i can say that very rarely was i underwhelmed by the contents of any of the episodes. It would be much easier to provide a list of episodes i loved rather than one's i didn't care for. Every episode as well as the premise alone creates thought provoking questions, but yet it was possibly the least pretentious shows I've encountered. The tone of the show is mostly calm with a decent bit of depression, but it will instill every other possible emotion in you at one point or another. Despite not being a continuous narrative, and so lacking the ability to create a MASTERPIECE of a story, i still award Mushishi a perfect score for achieving what its trying to accomplish.\
Score: 10/10\
Characters: \
There is only one character to be discussed in particular for this review-Ginko. Ginko is the single best use of a character to tell a story that i have ever seen. Ginko travels from village to village as he continues his studies as a Mushi-Shi (Mushi Master/Expert). Ginko provides an educated and non judgmental guide through the world that he lives in, and everything that the mushi represent. Do to his prominent role in the world relating to mushi, the exposition that Ginko provides is more than just a choir to understand the world, but rather a portal into the lives of the unsuspecting farmers and citizens he comes across. THAT is what makes Ginko one of the best uses of an main character that i have ever come across. Unfortunately, do to the episodic nature of the show, some of the characters met throughout the show are lackluster and do not live up to the sense of the reality that others do. However, this takes little away from the grand scheme of the show and even still, all the characters fill their roles well enough.\
Score: 9/10\
Art/Sound:\
There isn't much to say when it comes to the art and music of Mushishi, just appropriate. The art is calming and yet mysterious, creating one of the best atmospheres I've ever seen in any piece of animation.  The color palette used is perfect for the show, and the music mimics what the art and story call for. Apart from no WOW piece of music, this is as perfect a soundtrack you can hope for.\
Score: 10/10 (Art),  9/10 (Music)\
Concluding thoughts:\
Enjoyment: 10/10 (My favorite show)\
On very rare occasions do i provide perfect scores to anything, and that's in any medium of entertainment. I wouldn't call myself a stickler when it comes to scores, but it's undeniable that i just plain don't give out 10's often. I recommend Mushishi for anybody that's looking for an episodic show with great storytelling, but doesn't need it to be extraordinary eventful. Mushishi knows what it is, and cares for each of its stories, and THAT is what makes it a perfect show.\
Overall: 10/10 (Masterpiece)",

    Mushishi is a one of a kind treat that I feel like I could show to any anime fan and they'd enjoy it. It's calming yet interesting feel makes it's mood one of the most unique shows I've ever seen. While other animes will try to impress you by shoving its genius into your face, Mushishi is very subtle and has a very wise feel to it. \
Story:\
Normally, I don't enjoy episodic animes. If there isn't an interesting overarching plot line, I tend to find myself contemplating why I'm even watching the show. However, I never once felt that way with Mushishi. Sure, I was\
          \
        a little disappointed with the no overall storyline when I first watched it, but then I came to realize just how calming and ingenious the set up was. \
Art:\
It fit the mood, but it does seem a little old for its time.\
Sound:\
Every soundtrack fit and was absolutely gorgeous.\
Characters:\
Well, the characters, excluding the protagonist Ginko, changed from episode to episode, but all the characters provided were interesting and memorable in their own ways.\

Despite its flaws, Mushishi is one of the best executed anime I've ever seen. I enjoyed every second of it. \

    Wonderful. Outstanding. \
The art is awesome, it was definitely worthy to watch. Some of you might find it boring because every episode is the same as before [episodic], some people get trouble because of \"Mushi\" and Ginko is helping them.\
Super slow, yet relaxing, if you like fast anime this might not be for you. There is so little violence in it, no jumping around or out of the world movement. Each episode is mind boggling and it left you wonder. Filled with fantasy and reality, it's a definite masterpiece-at least for me. \

    **All of this is based solely on my opinion and to anyone who feels offended or troubled by it. My deepest apology**\
Well, Mushi-shi is one of the anime i think is underrated by everybody. When i show it to my Dad, he said it's boring. When i show it to my best friend, he said it's shitty. And so on and so on. Every people, i showed this anime will say it's boring. But i find myself quite fascinated by this anime, so read on, please.\
From what i think, this anime is really similar to \"Kousetsu Hyaku Monogatari\",\"Jigoku Shoujo\", and last but not least \"Jigoku\
          \
        Sensei Nube\" and if you want it American style, the \"Supernatural\" series, except the MC goes solo and kicks ass in this anime.\
If people found this anime to be boring, i'd say some of the episodes are, even i fell asleep in one of the episodes. But i really like the MC, Ginko. He really amazes with his calm and careful approach to the source of the problem. Rarely shows any signs of fear, and rather he shows amusement in the face of danger. I guess what really pulls me to this anime is the way Ginko carries himself through the problem.\
Definitely the anime for you if you like calm MC\
The music in this anime brings the vibe of old japanese era with extra creepy feeling. The OST, i'd say is doing their job nicely by adding a certain emotion to the anime.\
The artstyle and graphic animation, is just fine. Don't really love it, but i guess i can't imagine this anime going with other artstyle (Like SAO for instance ^^). So it's fine i guess\
The main cons of this anime though, is the lack of storyline. It's just all about Ginko travels around and solving problems along the way. Ginko meets several new character along the way, but they're just acting like some kind of bonus, and didn't really matter if you just forget them. Similar to \"Supernatural\", but \"Supernatural\", have more solid storyline, they have a main enemy, at least. But Mushishi just don't have it.\
I've watched the \"Mushishi Zoku Shou\" and the second season of it. And the my review is still the same. Cause the creator of this anime never heard of climax, rising action, and denoument.\
Das ist der Erste\
Friede!\

Mushishi is an episodic anime, meaning that every episode doesn't particularly connect with the other. At the first glance it may not seem very captivate or interesting, but please believe me, it won't cost much to give Mushishi a try, cause it's not as boring as you may think it is...\
Story 10 \
 The story is simple but still unique and pretty interesting. Every episode's story is told in a very poetic and enjoyable way, that makes you want to watch the next episode. Every episode is relaxing, breathtaking, and has a deep meaning. But still the story is not the only thing that makes\
          \
        this series so charming.\
Art 10\
The art is gorgeous, it has a wonderful pallet and an excellent design, it is exactly what the story needs, the art and the story are perfectly match with each other. The backgrounds were wonderful and of course the character design was nicely done in order to show how perfect the main character is.\
Sound 10\
Once again... The sound was fitting perfectly with the other elements of the show (story, art, characters). The voice actor of the main character Ginko (Nakano Yuto) was just excellent, I really enjoy his voice acting. Also the seyuu of the supporting cast done a really good job (especially with the younger characters). But what I really loved was the soundtracks, even thought they weren't very catchy they make you lose your self in the series and helps you relax.\
Character 10\
Ginko..... Just how brilliant this character may be? He loves what does, and he always tries to do what he can in order to help people with their mushi-problems. His background story was also beautiful. He really is a very captivating and charming character that I will always treasure. But except Ginko there are still the supporting characters. Even though they only play for one episode, be sure that you will remember them because of their background.\
Enjoyment 10\
This Anime is seriously recommended for everyone, and I mean it. To be honest at first I thought I would get bored of this series and drop it, mostly because a teacher of mine (art teacher, non-anime fan) suggested it to me... but even though I gave it a try, and hontony I loved it, and I watched it 3 times and when I get bored or want to relax I still watch my favorite episodes, I'm pretty sure that I will remember this Anime for a long-long time.\

    I don't know why I started watching this anime. I was actually surprised to see it so highly rated. But after watching it I can say with certainty that this is one of the most underrated animes series ever.\
Story:\
Mushishi is set in historic Japan with a fantasy element. Enter mushi which are supernatural creatures which are invisible to the naked/normal eye. The protagonist, Ginko is a mushi master or mushishi. The anime is episodic in nature with Ginko travelling along the country trying to study about them. This leads him to meet people who are affected by mushi. Another strong point about this series was\
          \
        that the episode endings didn't always have a good ending. The dialogues was also really well thought and still stay with me.\
Art:\
The character designs of mushishi is very interesting though very repetitive. Most of the characters look similar to each other except for a few characters. Artland simply did a marvelous job with the scenery. There were scenes in the anime where I got goosebumps. The story, excellent though it is, would not have left an impact on the viewer, if the scenery was unable to convey what was happening.\
Sound:\
Loved the opening as it caught the meaning of the anime. The background music was simply amazing and very soothing. I was transported into that world listening to it. The tracks suited the ongoing scenes. \
Character:\
Even though being episodic, the characters are one of the strongest if not the strongest point of the show. The new characters in the episode were so well developed to the point that I was actually surprised that the episode was only 20 minutes long. By the end of the series, even the enigmatic Ginko is given a good back story. It was this back story which truly allowed this anime to transition from an excellent anime to a masterpiece\
Enjoyment:\
When I initially started watching this series, I could only watch one episode per day, as I would try to savor it for the entire day. I liked it but wasn't really drawn to it. Then, as I mentioned before, the epic back story was the turning point for me. I enjoyed watching the series after that. At this stage, Mushishi had left its mark on me. \
Overall:\
This deserves infinity out of 10 according to me. This is definitely one of my all time favorites in any form of media. I do not know how many times I've rewatched it. \

    DaikiClub Bro Time-Saver Review:\
(Ironically these are starting to get too long)\
BLUF: Mushishi is a work of art. If you're not a 12 year old then you'll like the sound and beautiful imagery. 9/10\
Story- If you can call it that. There isn't any overarching plot or purpose; the main character Ginko just kind of walk around and does \"Mushi of the week\" stuff. But even without a full plot, it is very entertaining and I was excited to see the weekly mushi and plot resolution. 8\
Art- It's beautiful. The show describes these abstract beings called mushi and then shows them to you. The entire idea of\
          \
        the show is to let your imagination run wild. It's the most visually appealing show I've seen in a while. 10\
Sound- The OP and EP are the same for all 26 episodes.... Good! The EP and OP are really f*cking good and I want to hear them. I watched the Dub and Ginko's voice is very soothing and fit his character. This is also one of the only shows I've seen that actually makes good use of silence and nature sounds. 10\
Characters- The same deal as plot. Ginko is kind of this enigmatic journeyman with a mysterious past and I can get behind that. The weekly characters are all somewhat similar: downtrodden, good farm folk. But if it works, it works and it all fit together. The show definitely didn't take any risks in the character department, but it didn't need to because the mushi are the real characters. 8\
Enjoyment- If you don't like this show or think it's boring then you need to reevaluate your life. Go back to watching some weird harem wish-fulfillment or predictable battle shonen (*cough* SAO *cough* Bleach). This show doesn't have great effects or \"action\" but has a masterful use of sound and art. It's just really good. 10\
TL;DR Just watch it and appreciate it. You could watch it in a language you don't even know (like Japanese) and still be mesmerized by the visuals and sound. If you don't like it, then go watch Pokemon or something more your pace. ",

    The Tao of Mushishi [Originally written in 2016 for personal profile]\
Lao Tsu was a groovy boy in Warring-States-Period-China who lived his own way. One day he decided the people there weren't quite his style and so decided to fuck off. The guard of the path that Lao Tsu would take stopped him and asked him to write down his philosophy before he fucked off into the west. Lao Tsu consented and wrote down what is known as the Tao Te Ching, thereby birthing the ancient Chinese religion of Taoism.\
In the anime Mushishi, Ginko is a groovy boy who wanders around rural Japan researching spirits unseen\
          \
        by the typical human eye. Along his travels, he helps out the various locals, keeping mushi (the unseen spirits) from harming humans and trying to keep humans from harming the mushi. Ginko's no philosopher, but he follows the Tao in a way that touches my big fat bloody pulsating heart.\
The Tao is The Way. The Tao is The Path. Following the Tao means to be accepting, to recognize both the overwhelming futility and the overwhelming meaning of life. One who follows the Tao attempts wu wei, non-doing, the act of natural spontaneity. The Mushi-shi Ginko is one of the grooviest examples in animation of someone on this path. He appreciates the law of nature, delving through the deepest of woods without fear, respecting the forest spirits' space and aiming not to bother any mountain lords he may cross paths with. As our old Persian friend Omar Khayyam wrote, \"Oh, Wilderness were paradise enow!\" Ginko also accepts the law of man however, and does not seclude himself from its doings as an ascetic would. He accepts it all without regret, and simply continues on his Way.\
The Light Vein in Mushishi acts as a concrete example of Taoist life force, perhaps chi; Life Energy. While the forests and mountains throughout the path that the Light Vein takes are blessed with heightened life energy and therefore thriving species of plants, animals, and mushi, the Vein also can be simply too much. Much like in Celtic or ancient Oceanic mythology, an excess of mana can be severely dangerous and those who bear such power will have a divinity too much for those with a more balanced life force to bear. An excess of such power can cause destruction. Ginko recognizes this idea and as he travels the courses of the Light Vein, he makes certain to keep the ignorant villages from being overtaken by such excess. Such is the Tao; the balance of life energies, the essence of the Yin Yang.\

    I started watching this title on a whim after a long night at work and immediately it caught my attention. There was a bit of confusion in the beginning but the captivating interest of the Mushi within the various stories held my attention until I linked Ginko (I think that's his name) to his actual role and origins in the story was. \
So if you like a slow but steady pace of story telling with a super natural twist then this is a title to watch. The characters are well thought out and each episode has you wanting a bit more.\

    Anime tends to always attempt to captivate people by following a formula and hoping that it's slight differences would make up for the fact that it almost always follows a trend. Mushishi on the other hand is that rare gem in the darkness that is the exact opposite. Mushishi captivates others through it's artistic value. The atmosphere that it brings through it's score and it's art style is like never seen before. A streamlined story is replaced with an episodic nature where each story holds a weight as strong as those of the longest running anime.. It could be the fact that everything is shrouded\
          \
        underneath a blanket of unknown. The fact that so many questions are left unanswered leaves the imagination space to roam free. If you have not seen an episode of mushishi i highly recommend this masterpiece.\

    The small stories of the adventures that Ginko had gone on, is really fun to watch. After each episode, it makes you want to watch even more. Wishing that the season hadn't ended. The expressions on his face and some stories can really make you laugh. To be honest I am really happy this this one. I'm lucky I discovered it when it was on Netflix. XD I am also happy that all the Mushishi's seasons, specials, and movies are in the top 50. That tells you how wonderful the anime is. Amazing, I recommend you to watch it, it is quite interesting indeed. I'm\
          \
        actually really easy to please when it comes to something that has potential. \

    Have you ever had a conversation with a friend about why \"insert popular anime here\"(Sailor Moon, DBZ, Pokemon) is actually crap, and even after laying down evidence and arguments you can't come to a consensus. All too often this happens because both of you have different values. Some people want to watch an anime just to turn your brain off. Others want to feel a sense of nostalgia about their childhood. \
Mushi-shi follows that same note where it is an anime that you get or you don't. Where DBZ and Naruto are on one end of the spectrum that we call anime, Mushi-shi is on\
          \
        the polar opposite end. The late-and-great Osamu Tezuka wrote a manga titled \"Phoenix\", that is to this day revered as one of the best manga of all time. After reading a few volumes, it is not hard to tell why. \"Phoenix\" is very much a philosophical meditation on what it means to be alive/the meaning of life. Mushi-shi, in my opinion, is very similar to \"Phoenix\" in its execution and subject matter.\
Mushi-shi is very simple. Ginko is a spirit doctor who travels from village to village in order to make a living. The plot of Mushi-shi is trivial because it is\
episodic. Very little changes from one episode to the next. In fact you could watch this show entirely out of order and still enjoy it. Way to often, anime\
treads the same ground and oftentimes makes the same mistake. Every highschool anime in existence is oftentimes the same formula with minor twists, and this is coming from someone who enjoys the high school SOL genre. Mushi-shi masterfully avoids this pitfall of monotony because it is trying to encompass such a large array of human emotions and feelings. There is tragedy, redemption, suffering and anguish, revelation and love, all of these emotions evoked so effortlessly episode after episode.\
Anime can serve as a form as escapism, we watch idealized high school scenarios, or we can imagine that we are the OP ace pilot for a gundam, as \
viewers we can occupy ourselves in worlds that we desire. As a pessimist, Mushi-shi feels more like the world we do live in. A handful of these characters have endured incredible loss and misfortune. Yet, they go on living. Frankly, for me, there is nothing more uplifting than that. The toil and folly of human life is something rarely addressed as a serious topic in anime, and Mushi-shi basks in that, it bathes in it.\
This was clearly made on a shoestring budget,the animation is poor, sound effects are used sparingly or not at all sometimes. The color pallette is dull. \
Overall there is nothing visually engaging about Mushi-shi. My high score really derives entirely from the fact that I can not deny that Mushishi was a moving experience. The show did not need to have great animation, great dialogue, or great direction(which it does for the latter two), because the bedrock of what was being said and why it was being said resonated with me because of the almost immediate empathy I had for nearly all of these characters. \
Mushi-shi is a slow burn. Similar to shows like Boogiepop Phantom, Paranoia Agent, or Kino's Journey. You have to process it and find meaning in it from your own unique perspective, if you come into it with preconceived notions or trying to interpret it from someone else's lense you will probably leave disappointed. Some might get it right away, some may never get it and discard it altogether. Either way is completely fine, as long as you give Mushishi a chance. It has amassed a cult following for a reason.",

    To be honest, when I watched Mushishi for the first time, I hated it! Since it's episodic and doesn't really have an overarching plot; I thought it was boring and has nothing going for it except pretty visuals and nice music. But later on I noticed that you have to be in the proper mood to enjoy Mushishi: I tried to think to myself \"What kind of adventure will await me this episode\". So instead of expecting plot twists and story progression left and right, I started realizing what Mushishi really is: a collection of supernatural short stories with a heavy emphasis on atmosphere and\
          \
        subtlety.\
Plot and characters (7/10)\
Mushi (Japanese for \"bugs\") are basically spirits that sometimes resemble plants or bugs, and othertimes they're just plain bizarre beings. Mushi are not exactly good or evil, they're just doing their thing, but sometimes this causes trouble for people.\
This is when people seek help for Mushi-shi: experts on the topic of Mushi. The main character Ginko is one of those. Ginko has the nasty habit of attracting Mushi, so he can't stay for too long in one place. This is why he's just wandering from one place to another and in every episode he helps people who have trouble with those Mushi. Most of the time they don't even realize that their problems are caused by Mushi, but Ginko usually enlightens them. \
Even though the towns people that Ginko comes across all look and act very simmiliar to each other, they usually have a dramatic and emotional backstory, that makes the viewer care for them. You'll get the feeling that you got to know these peope really well in those 20 minutes of an episode (even if you didn't). Still, you most likely won't remember most of the characters, but insteadt the mysterious incedents that these people witness.\
Ginko himself is a really chill dude. You could argue that he is somewhat bland; and that might be true to some extent, but a loud and exagerated character would just be really distracting in an anime like this. It's always a pleasure listening to Ginko's explaination on how the various types of Mushi work. Of course this is also because his Japanese voice actor did a great job on capturing Ginko's laid back personality.\
Art & Music: (9/10)\
Easily the strongest aspect of Mushishi is it's audio visual department. The enviroments look really nice, there is a lot of detail in the backgrounds and the surreal places Ginko travels through create an amazing atmosphere. The characters look relatively simple though and are a contrast to the backgrounds.\
One thing I didn't like is that a lot of times the characters don't have faces. This isn't unusual in anime, especially when characters are more in the background (so it's not as noticeable), but in Mushishi these characters are clearly visible in the foreground!  That's only a very minor flaw however, the shows looks still really impressive for the most part.\
Another important aspect of Mushishi's atmosphere is the great music. Lots of traditional Japanese instruments are used, which I found very fitting. There wasn't that much of variety however, they mostly reused the same 4-5 tracks every episode, or at least that's what it felt like. But that's not a big deal, since there isn't constantly music playing. At least every episode had a different ending song, that was pretty cool.\
Overall Mushishi is a fantastic series. It's a really unique and relaxing anime, and it's especially fun it short bursts. For me personally, it's the show that finally sparked by interest in episodic anime.",

The opening theme track sets the series off beautifully and the sound through out is something special in itself.\
The story is something you like or don't but if you like it then you'll love this. It is not over complicated and is not flashy, the story is possibly it's only week point of the series most will find it slow moving compared to other shows in the genre, I\

    \"Mushi are life in its purest form\"\
Story (8):\
Mushishi doesn't have a single storyline, instead, each episode has its own original story. This does not however, affect the quality of the anime, as each story features something original and interesting. All of the episodes however, have something in common, and that is the appearance of \"mushi\", beings that are beyond life and death. In every episode, a new type of mushi appears. These mushi affect the world around them and can even determine the fate of mankind. The main character, Ginko, is a mushishi, or put simply, a person that specializes in mushi. He travels around\
          \
        the world dealing with the problems that mushi are responsible for, and does the best that he can to fix them.\
Art (9):\
The art is presented in a way which is very visually appealing, and at the same time very calm. It doesn't overdo it by adding too much detail, and it doesn't try to show-off. Instead, it presents itself as if it's not trying to impress at all, by just being natural. \
Sound (9):\
Like the art, the sound doesn't try to impress. The soundtracks consist of minimal, but effective melodies that express a variety of emotions and which go well with the anime.\
Character (9):\
The main character, Ginko, has a personality that allows him to express different thoughts and emotions while at the same time being able to think calmly and logically. He lives for the sake of his work and for the well being of mankind.\
The side characters of Mushishi consist of people whose lives are affected by mushi. Only one of them appears in multiple episodes, but as for the rest, they only appear in one.\
Enjoyment (8):\
Mushishi is the kind of anime that gradually gets better and better. It seems a bit boring at first but after each episode gets more and more interesting as the mysteries and powers of the mushi are unraveled.\
Overall (9):\
Aside from having captivating art and sound, Mushishi also serves a good amount of drama and a little action. It's ability to present many interesting ideas in many creative ways makes, and the fact that it successfully delivers without trying to impress, makes it one of the best anime ever made.\

    Although this anime doesn't have many constants throughout the series, the flow of the story is beautiful and has a calming effect.  Each episode reveals something more about the nature of the Mushi, and if you use the knowledge you gained from previous episodes, you gain a deeper understanding about the situations that occur.  The happenings are always varied; sometimes there's a happy ending and sometimes there's a sad ending, but sometimes it isn't that simple.  Though the literal substance of the show is about the paranormal, it focuses a lot on the human experience.  There is always a lot of\
          \
        emotion and internal conflict attached to each Mushi-related situation.  \
I love visually discovering each different type of Mushi throughout the show.  They all vary in shape, color and movement, though you can find similarities between them.  One Mushi might appear in the form of a rainbow, while another will take on the shape of a dragon.  All in all a beautifully executed concept. \
I'm not usually struck so deeply by anime soundtracks, but this one really took hold of me. Just as the show flows like a calm, steady river, so does the music.  It fits perfectly with the content of the show.  It sounds like something I would do yoga or meditate to.  It accurately depicts the flow of nature.\
Ginko, the Mushi-Shi whose journey we follow, is calm and mysterious, much like the Mushi he studies.  Watching the show, I felt as if I got to know Ginko better with each episode.  Though nonchalant and unattached to any one person or place, he cares very much about the people he encounters and helps.  Through this, we come to care deeply as well.  \
Mushi-Shi is not for you if you like things that are fast-paced, witty and/or highly comedic.  It is for people who love the supernatural, nature, and perhaps are looking for something they can relate to on an emotional level.\

     I guess there won´t be anything I can say that has not already been said a few times but I still want to tell you my opinion about Mushishi because this anime certainly is worth the effort of writing a review.\
It took me a lot of time to start watching this anime due to the synopsis, I just didn´t know what to think about it and so I ignored this anime for quite some time.\
But oh boy how wrong have I been by doing so\
After watching the first episode I was kind of confused to see that there is no real introduction and I\
          \
        was even more confused after finding out that the whole anime is about just one guy, seriously ? \
This may be a point someone might criticize but after watching a few more episodes I thought it was kind of unique, or let at least say refreshing.\
Refreshing is the right word for this anime and is even more suitable for the only main-character : Ginko\
A constantly smoking, one-eyed, weird-looking fellow with white hair and green eye(s), who seems somehow creepy at first... this could be seen as some kind of antagonist within some other anime but this is the hero of Mushishi and damn what a good one ! \
Wandering mostly through the nature of medieval Japan (which is, by the way, drawn in an extremely beautiful way) and occasionally visiting tiny villages and towns, Ginko makes his living by solving problems based on the so called \"Mushi\", beings very close to life itself and extremely versatile concerning appearence and dangerousness.\
Every episode takes a look at other people, other places and other Mushi, some of the stories are good, some are decent, some are genius but all of them are unique just because the Mushi and their effects when exposed to humans are that versatile. ( For those who already know, just remember the moonlight bridge, the string from the sky, the bamboo- mushi and all the other crazy stuff that happened, I mean... seriously, they had quite some fun writing stories like that )\
Moreover, the art is very special too, almost every side character looks the same, once again, I won´t say this is something that shouldn´t be criticized but I won´t because I liked it a lot. \
The repetitive style of the side characters sets the focus on their actions and their feelings, you have no chance but to take a look at their personlaities, rather than their looks, in order to judge them.\
To make it even more interesting, your final judgement can be even more complex after thinking about how they deal with their individual \"Mushi-problems\", or maybe are even the Mushi at fault for the people acting the way they do ? \
Can they even be charged for just being alive ? \
These are some questiones that came to my mind while watching Mushishi and I´m glad about that because this anime managed to make me think about somehow important questiones but without punching a certain image and problem right into my face and saying \" this is it and now make up your mind!\" \
What else can be said about Mushishi ? \
Sadly enough, it´s nothing that will become mainstream but maybe that´s for the best because that way it keeps this special status in my heart ( sry for writing stuff like that but I couldn´t come up with a better way to describe it ).\
It may be anything but mainstream and it may be very peculiar but that´s what makes Mushishi so great, that fact that there won´t be an anime that can come close to it.\
I had a great time watching Mushishi and can only recommend it to everyone, it sure is worth trying out so you better do so or else you will miss a truly one special, one BIG anime.\

    Visual stunning, musically brilliant, fantastic characters, and awe-inspiring world building, these are the things that come to mind when I think of Mushishi.\
Mushishi is an episodic show that follows Ginko, a Mushi master, as he travels around the world investing Mushi and helping the people that come into contact with them. As such, there is no overarching narrative leaving the interest in the series to derive completely from the sole recurring character (besides the narrator and one friend of Ginko who appears in 3 episodes). Ginko carries said burden wonderfully. Generally, he appears apathetic and removed. His voice (done wonderfully by Travis Willingham in the\
          \
        English dub) is generally monotone, however as you watch the show you will begin to realize that Ginko is deeply passionate about learning about Mushi and helping people. The credits rolled on the final episode leaving me with an empty feeling because I felt like a good friend of mine was leaving.\
Artistically and musically, the show was unlike anything I had ever seen. In a world that is so filled and ran by mystic beings (the Mushi) the art style and music had to fit with that and it certainly succeed in this task. The lighting and use of bright colors make the world feel magically. This feeling is complimented by the music. Ambient and minimalist the music exists perfectly within the show. I listened to the music some outside of the show and it conjured up scenes in the show. The music is so well-intertwined with scenes that they exist hand-in-hand and to have them separated feels as though I am cheating myself out of the full Mushishi experience.\
The story always drew me in too. No episode is directly related to any other episode (the closest thing being that events from other episodes are referenced in other episodes ex. the events of episode 1 are talked about in episode 5). Each one was wonderfully creative and served to add to the already vast and sprawling world of the Mushi. From this, you will get my only critique of the show: many episodes are vastly less interesting than others. Mushi are not good nor are they evil. They merely exist. Often times then, the mushi, in their own existence, will cause problems for humans in their existence. Sometimes, these issues are interesting and sometimes they are not. I can remember several times throughout the series where watching one of the episodes felt like a chore because I either did not care about what the Mushi were doing or I didn't like the people that were being effected by the Mushi. However, these episodes are few and far between and should not prevent anyone from watching this excellent show. \

    Mushishi is a Adventure, Mystery, Drama, Fantasy, and Supernatural show. It's a very episodic show, so you can really jump in anywhere. While the second season has somewhat of a plot. So, animation wise this show is great with its beautiful world that has me watching it just to see. There are some problems when it comes to characters, but the nature more than compensates. The story is following a person called Ginko and he is a Mushishi that helps keep everything in balance. Its around 26 episodes just it little over than most. The director is Hiroshi Nagahama and hes has done shows like\
          \
        Detroit Metal City and the Flowers of Evil. In my opinion hes just ok, nothing real special. The studio Artland has done shows Legend of the Galactic Heroes and Hitman Reborn. I would say Artland has helped more than create their own shows. As of now there is no Dub of the show. Some of my likes would be the art work and the ability to watch any episode. Some of my problems is that there is no story line and at times doesn't give us much information about who he is as a person. Saying all of that I would rate this show 7.5 out of 10. I would recommend it if you watch a very chill and calming series.\

    Mushi are described as beings neither good nor evil. In reality they are embodiments of untenable evil, destroying countless lives throughout the world. The mushi can be diseases, natural disasters, parasites, natural phenomenon, plants, ghosts, etc. Coming into contact with mushi will nine out of ten times result in chronic injury or a fate worse than death. Even rainbows can be mushi, and though they're pretty and alluring, they most probably have a plus-sized kill-count. Don't mess with the fucking mushi.\
Every episode tells a stand-alone story. There's little continuation in the series, nor is there a greater plot. In each episode we see whole communities\
          \
        without knowledge of the mushi getting their lives destroyed. The protagonist Ginko is a mushi-guru, his official title is a mushishi. He travels around the country because mushi follow him everywhere, and staying with any community would bring them horrendous calamities. Ginko tries to help the people he meets by sharing his knowledge of the mushi. However, as an observant eye can tell, his task is insurmountable. There is only misery and death in the world ravaged by the merciless mushi.\

    If you don't mind episodic anime then this could be an interesting experience. Mushishi follows the various travels of a mushi master named Ginko. (He's basically a doctor/biologist). On his journey's, he encounters these creatures of nature named Mushi who affect the lives of others ranging from visions of the future, odd illnesses & other strange phenomenon.\
Every episode is its own story showing how people's lives have changed from the mushi for better or worse. Most tales result in Ginko aiding people who been cursed by mushi or at least attempt to save their lives as not all episodes end in happiness. Mushishi is certainly\
          \
        mystical with its heavy atmosphere where music will often take dominance in the scene causing either relaxation or terror for its viewer. There's an abundance in creativity in this series such as man trying to catch a rainbow or a family who was born from plants. These types of stories bear resemblance to Osamu Tezuka's writing in his \"Black Jack\" series as Mushishi themes range from the preservation of nature & the importance of life.\
The mushi are not good nor evil just a force of nature in which Ginko discovers in his many trips across the world. Most episodes are great stories but obviously could vary from person to person but with its 2nd season debut can hopefully lead to more enchanting story lines. Not for everyone but definitely offers an insight towards morality & man vs nature. Enter the world of mushi where Ginko does his best to understand the unknown.\

I can't agree with that average score this show has...\
This show is episodic and has mainly just one character wandering alone. It also doesn't help that said one main character is practically lifeless. \
What kind of life can you have without people around you? Ginko, the lead, can't be attached to anyone since he's wandering from village to village. Well, he has to. It's a plot point. That doesn't mean someone couldn't have been traveling with him...\
The stories about the different mushi were somewhat interesting, I guess. In ten plus years of watching anime I haven't seen any show that mentions these odd creatures.\

    Mushishi, beautiful does not capture its essence.\
Outstanding in its world building, perfect resonance with its sound, Mushishi boasts some of the most potent story telling that there could be.\
Story: 9\
The development of the world is not located within a fixed perspective. Every character has a story of their own, their own reasons, motivations. The challenge for alternate world perspectives is always to balance the development of details with character development. Often this need to simultaneously reconcile the character's progression with the world's produces glaring inconsistencies. Mushishi beautifully resolves this by not circumscribing itself to any one character. The plot development is beautiful.\
Character: 8\
Extremely lively characters.\
          \
        Personalities in Mushishi are brimming with life, motivations. It is very exciting to identify what the possible motivation was. However, personality progression is located within episodes and rarely outside it. This is understandable given how this really helps enhance the consistency of the world development. \
If the second and third seasons are to be counted this would count as a 9.\
Sound: 9\
The soundtrack is phenomenal. It resonates with the storyline, amplifying every moment.\
Overall: 9\
Mushishi is an excellent series. However, one should be warned against binge watching it. Each and every episode is meant to be savoured slowly. \

    Simply put, I think that Mushishi is the best anime ever to be made. None other nears the masterful storytelling, excellent technical completeness and richness of Mushishi, which coexists with its strongly defined style, far from cliché and stereotypes. But the greatest thing about Mushishi is that it's one of the extremely few animes that reach the point of being poetic (along with Kino no Tabi, Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei and Mononoke Hime). These four animes have become art and are the only ones I have watched to do so.\
Musishi overtakes them most importantly for the structural perfection of its plot and the amazing contrast of\
          \
        lyrical stories told in an epic overarching set, bound by the setting and Ginko himself. Narrating tales of few, but that however manage to encompass humanity itself.\
There is no more that I can say, other than that you should watch this and that it may feel to have a more natural (slower) pace than almost any other anime, but the use of inserts, scenic sound and other resources allow the story to flow amazingly.\

    First Review on MAL, any constructive feedback would be appreciated:Anime has always truly been a beautiful branch of media, and I can't think of an anime that exemplifies this statement better than Mushishi. Now before I start I would like to say that this show definitely isn't for everyone, slow pacing and it's episodic and and unusual nature may throw people off. However if you like episodic animes this is glorious. If you need heart pounding action and romance mushishi is not for you. If you need a story that continues on a weekly basis this anime is not for you. However if you want\
          \
        something that isn't ordinary but truly extraordinary, an anime with such great themes and beauty, this is definitely for you. What makes mushishi special is that the entire anime focuses on one character. Now this character is well developed and interesting and as he interacts with different side character that appear briefly you realize that they are great too. The musical score and art compliment each other perfectly and the voice acting is great as well. Mushishi is a show that asks you to reflect on various themes each episode presents. And the episodes in this series range from happy to sad to in between there is such variety in this. The story is beautiful being just a wandering man and the idea of mushi,these minute forms of life gives the story so much depth and simplicity is where this anime succeeds.\
 In conclusion mushishi was an anime that firmly implanted itself in my top 3 favorite animes with it's themes, art, music, and atmosphere. While watching this, relax, enjoy the ride you'll never see anything quite like it again.\

    Mushishi isn't an anime you watch because it's exciting. Mushishi is an anime you watch because mysterious and emotionally powerful. It very much reminds reminds me of a fairy tale in that it's about small groups of characters and their strange circumstances. There is no epic scale, no world that is at stake. At most, a single village is affected by the proceedings. Yet, this scale makes what goes on very powerful. Having a single peasant being harmed in an age without running water and where all a person is likely to see is their village makes the hardship all the more difficult to bear.\
          \
        Many episodes don't have a happy ending although some do. Life is hard in this beautiful and dangerous world and people do there best to survive, find happiness, and cope with the supernatural. It's not exciting but it is wondrous. It's certainly unlike any other anime I've seen. It's probably worth watching for that reason alone, but know that the individual stories and charters are also very good.\

    Here we are in feudal Japan (we dont have the exact time given, you can just deduct it yourself). But this simple world of humans consists of a second world, the mushi one. Mushi are the most basic forms of life in the world. They exist without any goals or purposes aside from simply \"being.\" They are beyond the shackles of the words \"good\" and \"evil.\" Mushi can exist in countless forms and are capable of mimicking things from the natural world such as plants, diseases, and even phenomena like rainbows. Basically they are a form of life not coexisting with people. BUT sometimes getting\
          \
        in a way with our world.\
Not all people can see Mushi there is just a few of them.\
The story is connected but not focused on Ginko, a mushishi, which is basically a doctor for problems with Mushi. Mushishi gather knowledge about mushi and then use that to cure people when they interact with human.\
Storyline is pretty lazy, which I actually love. There's no actual storyline that we follow, in every episode we have a different story, different thing that happen to come by on Ginkos way. Every episode consist of a story that Ginko tries to solve, where he is not always succesful.\
VIBE:\
The atmosphere that this series creates is amazing. I recommend watching only one episode per day, the reason for that will be explained in a second. As you will see throughout this series Im a fan of visual expierience, meaning a anime that will give me shivers just by looking at it. Talking is reduced to minimum, music is minimalistic, animation is slow. Everything gives you this special atmospehere of silence. When you listen about those stories of mushi and people, sometimes sad, sometimes creepy or even scary I would say, you will get the shivers. The reason for watching only one episode per day is that you have to have time to think about every episode, I know when youre pumped about an anime you just have to watch the whole series in one day :P But trust me you need time, the thing that Ginko also travels long distances between episodes gives you this feeling that time actually passed.\
ART STYLE:\
There's not much to say. It's just astonishingly good, you can see that every place that Ginko was at, was designed with every detail. Each face is masterfully animated. Really not much to say, it's just good.\
MUSIC/VOICEACTING:\
Let's start of with voiceacting. I love it. This is srsly the best voiceacting I ever got in any anime, every voice is original and accurately chosen. You also never heard those voice before for sure. Even Ginkos voice. The only big role for the actor behind his voice was Ginko, congrats to producers for choosing such a great actor, Im glad they looked into it. They could have just got someone famous and not care about it.\
The music, daaaaamn. I watched every opening and ending, every single one of them, just because of the music. The openings are original, because they chose indie english music, which is rather weird, often people use just japanese music. Check out Lucy Rose - Shiver, like the best song ever. As I mentioned earlier the music is minimalistic, meaning there is not much to it. 3 sounds cooperating with each other making a simple music, yet it provied superb vibe, and builds up the whole thing.\
STORYLINE: \
Well there is not much of a story line, so I can't really talk about it a lot. But I can say that story of every episode is different, I remeber watching only one episode that was worse then the other. Only one, the rest of them are just great, the most are amazing.\
Well in concusion I say 10/10, I just love these types of animes, and this one was perfectly excecuted. There's also manga of this, so I need to jump on that!\

    Mushishi is a very unique show. Its a show that needs several conditions to be met if one wishes to enjoy it. Its a relaxing anime, often with a melancholic tone. Before we get to the review my suggestion is this: Download it, put your flash drive on the tv, and when no one else is around and its night time, sit on the couch, relax and turn it on. If you have an air-conditioner available, use it.\
Now let's get to the review:\
Story 10/10\
Our main character ginko travels in rather exotic places, from one village to another, helping people he encounters. The story is simple\
          \
        and yet solid. As i watched this show i had a strong urge to visit such places, to go camping and admire the nature, to sleep while watching the night sky. That kind of lifestyle has been a dream of mine, and when i watched this show i felt that something began to awaken within me. Its precisely that feeling that makes you really enjoy an anime, hence the 10/10...\
Art 9/10\
Beautiful sceneries, gorgeous landscapes, and a very good looking main character. Considering the date this anime was first released (2005-2006), the animation and art are truly outstanding. If tou like eye-candy and you also like nature, then this anime is for you.\
Sound 9/10\
The opening song is something that took some time to get used to, but once that happened, i stopped skipping it, and listened to it everytime. The soundtracks however are the real masterpiece here. Soothing, relaxing, each and every one matching the situation perfectly. The sound managed to compliment the beauty of the art, tying everything in a nice little bow. I would've liked it if a couple of the songs had lyrics though, but its alright.\
I watched the dubbed version of this anime, and i've got to say that ginko's voice still echoes inside my head. Wonderful!\
Characters 10/10\
Unlike other episodic shows, every new character you meet in one episode, will not appear in the rest. As such, you don't get to know each character deeply and get attached to them. So i am basing my rating on ginko alone. He is a smart man, rather bold, eager to help anyone who is in need. Using his wisdom he tries to always find the best solution to the problem he is facing although there are times that even his deep knowledge can't fix the issue.\
Enjoyment 10/10\
Needless to say, this anime was a masterpiece. Most anime nowadays are action-packed just because it attracts fans. This show proves that the enjoyment of an anime does not depend on action but rather the entire premise and back story. What i especially enjoyed about this series is that it is rather realistic despite having supernatural elements. The problems that people face are unique, interesting and dramatic. Not every one of those problems could be solved and that's what's realistic about it. Each episode was a life-lesson. \

    Mushishi - this title refers to the vocation of our main male protagonist. You may think now why the hell should someone state this obvious fact and highlight it the way I am doing right now. Now the reason behind this is simple - if you take a deeper look into the meaning of the word mushishi you'll understand, that the translation basically goes like this: 'mushi-master' or more precisely 'master of insects'. \
Our 'master of insects' is naturally bound to experience the strangest events on his journey as the title already emphasizes his connection to the nature. In the world of mushishi however one\
          \
        can't achieve a profound understanding of the nature without paying attention to the 'mushi' who play a major to the environment by influencing the laws of nature. There are many episodes where these mushi are used in an explanatory manner to describe the sensitive ecological balance which interacts with the human race as a whole either in a positive or a negative way. \
This whole setup leads into some very interesting story's told by the author in a mature way meaning as I've already stated, you won't always sit there watching this anime with a smile on your face but sometimes if you grasp the whole situation it's possible that you'll find yourself having a lump in your throat. What you'll get certainly though after watching an episode is a message that you may be able to relate yourself to. \

    In general, it has a good feel to it, and can be fun to watch when bored. \
The art and sound are pretty good for 2006.\
This anime is pretty unique in the story part though. As I said before, it can be fun to watch, but if you're in the mood for action, there isn't much of that.\
It also does not allow for much thought on the conflict, since most problems are solved by some secret technique that the viewer couldn't possibly know. In fact most problems seem to just be solved by some sort of random magic for convenience.\

    Mushishi is an anime that has an outstanding atmosphere around it. The art and the sound are, for me, it's best points. However, even though I am a relaxed person and I like chill settings, the story and the character development are too slow-paced. They haven't stricken me as surprising or oustanding. Let me explain why I say that. \
Story: 9/10\
The story gravitates around Mushi -a misterious lifeform that resemble ghosts- and the main character, Ginko, who is a Mushishi, a specialist in dealing with this lifeforms. Each episode has an entirely different  scenario and, at least at first, it seems like nothing comes\
          \
        together. However, small pieces of information appear in every episode and the mistery around the protagonist and the \"mushi\" starts to disappear. I will not go deeper into it because I want to avoid spoilers of all kinds(if spoilers can truly happen in this series). \
I gave the story a 9 because of the other features that the whole series has. In itself, I found the story truly boring. No dynamics, no plot twists, no attention catchers whatsoever. However, this series was not created for its complicated storyline, but for the atmosphere around the story. This is the strong point about Mushishi. The images and the symbols do the talking.\
Art: 10/10\
The art of this anime is simply fantastic. It is a pleasure watching the scenery. If I may exaggerate, it is the only thing that kept me going through this series when I got bored. The producers really did a great job on the aestethic part. \
\
Sound: 10/10\
Really good sound effects and , also, good music. The quality is flawless but the important thing is that it provides the necessary ambient for the atmosphere of the series. Both the intro and sound effects throughout the episodes offer a peaceful and calm ambient in which you can't but get lost in. I remember countless times as I was watching and I almost fell asleep. Really relaxing. \
\
Character: 9/10\
Here, things get tricky. Aside from Ginko, everyone is a temporary and secundary character. This means that the development of the secundary characters start \"rock-bottom\" at the begging of the episode and by the end it goes \"sky-high\". This seems a little abrupt but it gives off a strange, yet pleasant feeling. On the other side, Ginko's development is very slow-paced and there are no big changes in his character as he is very flexible and reliable no matter what the difficulty. All things aside, a good diversity of character development and personality types.\
\
Enjoyment: 8/10\
To put it bluntly, I was bored quite often. Maybe I just don't understand the peaceful and almost static action of this type of series. What I enjoyed, though, was the scenery, the symbols and the lessons at the end of the episode. Very insightful about a large deal of \"normal\" problems, described in a fantasy world.\
\
Overall: 9/10\
To be quick about it, Mushishi is very relaxing and static. It lets you discover a new fantastic world in which mistery is around every corner. If you like this type of slow-paced shows, I recommand this series to you. If you like more complicated storylines or more action in your anime, please search something else or give this a try, but don't despair.\

    Mushishi is a show keeping tabs on a white haired bloke called Ginko, unlike most peep's, Ginko can see plankton like creatures called Mushishi that inhabit his world. They come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes and due to their mostly obscure nature, they have the habit of causing negative things to happen to those around them. Ginko makes his living by taking advantage of his ability's and helping those who have problems as a result of the mushi, each episode focuses solely on a single story and there's no real order or over arching narrative at play here.\
The best thing about Mushishi\
          \
        so by far is the character of Ginko, he's so different and unique I can't name another character even remotely like him, if I had to describe him to someone I'de call him the most soft-spoken bad ass to ever be written, he's never boastful, brash or barges into situations without a seconds thought, he's calm, knowledgeable and immensely caring of those around him. As a result of his likeability, it doesn't really matter that all of the characters that Ginko meets will only be around for the duration of the episode. \
The show in turn manages to keep it's self interesting through its structure, as mentioned, each episode revolves around Ginko helping other people out with Mushi related problems, but since the only limitation of what the Mushi can do is the imagination of the writer, many different and unique stories are told throughout the duration of the show. In turn though, Mushishi doesn't remain a purely happy show as it might initially give the impression, there are some truly saddening episodes which provide some nice emotional variety to keep things fresh.\
Another huge boost to the quality of the show is the setting, the choice of feudal Japan goes a great way of adding to the sense of wonder and mystery since it seems so foreign yet rooted in reality. The background art goes a long way is helping this, since to put it simply, its beautiful, it add's so much to the crispness of the setting and makes each individual frame something to behold.\
The writing is also spot on, the pacing is well done throughout each episode and the topics touched upon felt well thought out, at the end of each episode there's sense of awe that I had leaving me to ponder my thoughts for the rest of the day. This said, at times Mushishi can feel like it explains alot in a little space of time, I wouldn't call it an anime that requires your full attention or multiple viewings to understand, but there are moments when things can be missed and I found myself rewinding the video in the hope of understanding what just happened, I'm not sure if this is down to poor writing or the occasional mistranslation, but it's a minor issue that happens rarely.\
There are a few other issues that I have mind, for starters, the animation really isn't anything to write home about, for the most part it boils down to your clichéd \"moving of the mouth without the jaw\" type of animation, however, this can be excused since the show never really needs well animated scenes with lots of frames plus the voice acting makes pretty much all the dialogue bearable, while I can't say from a huge amount of experience with the medium, Mushishi does have the most consistently good voice acting I've ever heard, there isn't a single voice that I would consider \"bad\" and it only really dip's down to \"average\" quality now and then which helps with the immersion of the show.\
What has a tendency to break the immersion mind is certain frames of character art, for the most part it's just fine but now and then the animators got lazy and just don't draw the faces. I realise that this is done pretty commonly in hand drawn animation due to the limitations of the medium, but the instances I refer to are shot's where the characters face's aren't even that far away. It's not a deal breaker but it can be a pain here and there.\
Getting into the raw nitpicky stuff, there were two episodes that I felt where rather meh, one involving a rainbow and the other involving a woman who was loosing her memories, while neither was poorly handled, I just felt they lack a sense of mystery that made the rest of the anime so enjoyable to watch, but this is only two episodes.\
Another thing to pick at is the character designs, while there's initially nothing wrong with them, and for the most part they look nice (especially those dressing gown things everyone seems to be wearing all the time, they look nice). I found that different age groups of different sex's all looked very similar, especially the youngsters. While not a deal breaker I couldn't help but have a sense of deja vu when the show introduced a new character who looked like an old one, for the most part, hair styles and cloths are the only things to use to tell them apart. \
Generally you should probably watch it, yeah... go watch it.\

    Mushishi is quite different from most of the other anime out there. It has the single most original story I have ever encountered and many times I felt compelled to watch more just to see what other marvellous things the writers of this anime had come up with. \
Story: \
10/10\
The story (or rather stories, each episode is a seperate story in a way) revolves around a form of life called Mushi, and the Mushi-shi named Ginko. Mushi is a very mysterious form of life and they take many shapes and sized and can have strange and mysterious effects on the things around them, including humans.\
          \
        sometimes however, these effects are rather unfortunate for the humans and the enviroment, and so a Mushi-shi is there to \"fix it\". This is Ginko's job, and he is always wandering through the land, and in every episode he stops at a new place to face another mushi and a phenomenon caused by them. \
Art:\

The art of this show is outstanding. It has been done very well and the sheer beauty of the scenery will put you in a nice and soothing mood. it also adds to the calm and mysterious atmosphere of the show. \
Sound:\

The music and sound for Mushishi are both top notch. The sound effects are perfect. The soundtrack is a lot like the art of the show, in the way that it adds to the mysterious and calm atmosphere. The soundtrack seems so well adjusted to the mood of the show and is overall a great factor in the anime.\

8/10\
The main character, Ginko, is one of my favourite characters in anime. He has an attitude and a way of looking at life and the things around him that just puts you at ease. You feel like you just wanna hang around with him and relax, whether it be helping him deal with mushi or just wandering with him on his travels. The other characters of the show are also great in personality and look, however they could have looked a little more different from eachother. sometimes you feel like wherever he goes its the same people living there because they look so similar, this is why characters only got a 8/10 from me.\
Enjoyment:\
10/10\
one of the best I have seen, and one of those I enjoyed the most. I could have watched a 1000 episodes of this anime if they could have been able to make that many episodes with the same quality as the current 26. Even though there isnt a main story (except for the personal one of Ginko) progressing though the anime, I kept wanting to watch the next episode, just to see what kind of stange and mysterious mushi ginko would deal with. Also the anime's art, story and music just puts you in such a pleasant mood of utter calmness where you just want to stay. \
Overall\
10/10\
I will probably never find an anime that feels quite like this one, and if I do, that will be a very happy moment for me. This anime is a must see, and a unique masterpiece that you cannot allow yourself to miss",

    The anime \"Mushishi\" is a calm anime about a traveler called Ginko, who roams the land searching for paranormal phenomenons caused by so called \"Mushi\".\
Mushi are basically the essence of life, if you will. It is not a human or a plant, nor is it an animal. Not every human can see Mushi, but if it is a parasitic Mushi, one can be already living with one..\
The story rolls as Ginko travels around the land searching for different kinds of Mushi, and helps people, who are involved with them get better, or he helps people understand their nature.\
I will not tell another thing about this\
          \
        anime, because I don't want to spoil anything, and you have to get a feel for the show for yourself.\
In my honest opinion, this show is the best anime series I have ever encountered. The soundtrack is perfect, the show has its own unique character and very good art.\
I would highly recommend watching this show for people who are literally sickened of empty-minded anime full of destruction, fighting and other means of harassment..\
Good luck watching.\

    Mushishi is like an active meditation with its music and art. To empty your mind it is an excellent way. It is really a touch for the soul especially if you keep some naiveness in you that maybe mushi is really out there in a form that we don't really know.\
It tells one episode-long stories about Ginko and his patients. A moral dilemma can be found on most of the stories that I remember. So it is a nice anime to watch.\
However if you don't watch it on good quality or a good speaker I don't really recommend you to watch it at all. \

    Mushishi is proving to be a lively so powerful in the quiet he inspires respect. This is a series that reflects but avoids getting lost in sermons and other clichés of the genre. The only morality is apparent harmony between man and his surroundings. \
Avoid unnecessary destruction and vehement is a good message that is sufficient to itself, no need to make tons ... Mushishi avoids this pitfall.\
 If sometimes the explanations can be complicated and difficult to follow, the anime as a whole is apprehended easily in my opinion. \
The choice not to reveal any arc is original and very well thought out as\
          \
        it serves as the dynamics of the anime.\
 Finally the conclusion mood: mix of music, graphics, chara-design scenario is so relaxing, so enjoyable that we would like it never stops.\
 But Mushishi knows neither beginning nor end, it is a continuity that is in your mind and that it is your responsibility to life!\

    This is a very interesting series.  The deliberate pacing can be very off putting at first but if you give it the chance it becomes almost hypnotic pulling you into a world of secrets and magic.  In Mushi-Shi the world is inhabited with tiny creatures known as Mushi.  Though generally not malicious theses creatures, invisible to nearly everyone, can cause great difficulty and pain to humans who stumble upon them. Though the common character throughout the episodes is Gin, a Mushi Master, it is wrong to think of him as a protagonist.  The episodes rather focus on the normal people who's\
          \
        lives have been disrupted by the intrusion of a Mushi into their lives.  This is an affecting and arresting series well worth a watch.  Give it a few episodes, it takes a while to fall under the spell but once you do it leaves a mark.  Stunning art including watercolor backgrounds add to the arresting atmosphere of the show.  Well worth a watch\

Hey this is my second review... What i usually do is that i finish an anime and then only will proceed to watch the next.... But in the case of Mushishi it is not.  The anime is great but lacks a central plot.. Each episode has a different story.. So there are only few recurring characters. So whether u watch the 15th or the 23rd episode doesnt make a difference... Each episode is done pretty well..I liked it a lot but it is not addictive.. The intro music is pretty good. And if u are into philosophy, this a must\
          \
        see.. The beauty of this anime is that u can watch this anime at any time , may be after 20-30 days..:P The entire anime is like short stories ....not related to each other ...except for the main character...\

    While watching the first episode of this calm, story-driven supernatural fantasy I never thought how closely I'd get attached to it, nor that in just a few more episodes it would become one of my favorite animated shows ever.\
Just from the first few notes of the acoustic guitar from the opening song, you get a sign that it is time to slow down, cool off, forget all your problems and just drift away from the world you know, into a completely different, fascinating world, where people believe there's more to life and existance than we know.\
Whether the story takes place during winter in a remote\
          \
        village, or warm spring and a farm on a mountain slope, the scenery is always beautiful. Even the tiniest of plants look alive and the hills buried in fog seem hazy and weary.\
None of the characters are too bright or standing out. And a very important reason for that, is that the show isn't about the characters. It is about the stories they tell. The person telling the story might play a very big part in it, but you can't help but forget the person's face as you drift away into the fantasy world as if you're lying next to the campfire, feeling its warmth, hearing the distant sounds, feeling the sweet smell of the atmosphere that surrounds you, while listening to stories not one person apart from you and the storyteller has ever heard of.\
When an episode reaches the end, the story always reaches its conclusion, be it something that is too unfathomable for our world, or something personal, maybe even too simple or obvious to be noticed straight away. A soothing ending theme composed especially for each episode takes off, as your mind enters a dreamworld of its own.\
Mushishi is not pretending to be something it isn't. It does not try to enliven its stories with anything that has since become a cliché element. It expects you to understand that at this moment you're only the listener, and not the storyteller. But such a strong and quite unexplainable attachment that I feel towards something as modest as this, can be called nothing short of ...Love.\

The art may not be for everyone from it still very beautiful. (7/10)\
The sounds of nature really bring this anime together. It's like being in a forst or near a waterfall. It's really something. (10/10)\

Hey there are you tired of all action and explosions or just want to chill well you are at right place.Welcome to Heralder's chill lounge. \
Mushishi is 26 episodes long anime produced by artland and aired in 2005.\
Story:8\
Mushishi follows the story of Mushi-shi Ginko on his travel and quest to learn more about mysterious beings which are considered fabrics of life known as mushi.Story is mostly episodic and slow paced having different  mushi and its interaction with different peoples.\
Art:10\
Simply mesmerizing every piece of scenery(jungle,fishing town,snow...) is beautiful.Animation is stelar but not main focus due to the nature of the show itself.\
Sound:10\
Soundtrack is what makes\
          \
        mushishi an experience it fits the scene perfectly being the chill tunes,to some more deep sounds to emphasize ever present loneliness,anger and other emotion tackled in this show\
Character:8\
Due to its episodic nature and small cast of reapering characters excluding Ginko characters are abundant but they don't feel they are fleshed out for the small time they are on screen.You will meet Ginko during his journey with few origin and flashback episodes\
Enjoyment:9\
I really liked this anime it was one great journey and i cant wait for its recently  \
announcement second season.\
Overall:9\
As a sucker for slow paced anime i really enjoyed Mushishi and i will recommend it to anyone looking for anime to chill but be warn the overall feeling of Mushishi can be quite dark and can make you feel a bit down \
And with that ends my #3 review thank you for reading and and be sure to visit my profile and check out my list,Heralder out!",

    Mushishi intrigued me, the beginning hook drew me in and made me curious.  It had a science fiction feel about it but most of the things were explaining natural phenomena in a different way.  \
In some ways the anime was very focused on realism, the various diseases and symptoms the characters displayed could be connected to real diseases.  Although the way these diseases were cured and diagnosed was where the science fiction and fantasy came into play.  \
To those who like puzzles, mysteries, and are of scientific mind be sure to take a look at this anime.  When watching through\
          \
        the anime it gives the viewer the sense of tipping their head to the side and thinking about what was going on.\
The storyline of this anime is fairly non existent, there are brief summaries of the main character's past but for the most part it is focused on his various encounters with the mysterious creatures known as mushi.  Each episode features it's own story, they slightly build on each other but a person who watches this anime from somewhere in the middle will be able to grasp the concept without an incredible amount of difficulty.\
The art is very well done and have spectacularly drawn scenes that could easily be used as backgrounds or posters.  The animation itself is very fluid and the details from scene to scene are intricate and complex.  It also has a very mystical feel about it.\
The sound is very good, there is nothing spectacular about it but it was fluid and fit nicely in with the rest of the anime.\
The characters or the main character was very in depth and unique he had a calm reflective personality and I was drawn in by his actions.  Whenever presented with a situation he would have a logical solution out of it, very interesting to see his reactions to different situations.\
Overall I thought that this was a spectacular anime, it saddened me to learn it was only twenty-six episodes long but each were unique and captivating.  My only complaint would be the lack of the story and about the way it ended.  It was outstanding in every other way, I was very impressed. \

    STORY [9] \
It's difficult to describe the genre Mushishi would qualify as, the best I can do is a kind of 'Shamanistic Medical Drama' but even that doesn't really do it justice. The story follows a travelling 'Mushi-shi', an expert in the ways of mushi; spiritual creatures that often gather and manifest symptoms similar to diseases in other life forms. He travels rural japan treating the ailments of those negatively effected by the mushi. \
Each individual episode is it's own independent story, and as such the show could potentially be watched in any order. (A big plus as some of the volumes of the dvds\
          \
        are unavailable) \
However some may find the episodic nature of the show formulaic and repetitive or even a little dull. This show definitely isn't for everyone, particularly those seeking lots of action or romance should look elsewhere. \
CHARACTER [7] \
Yes not characters, character. As Ginko, the travelling Mushishi is the only recurring character throughout the series. He takes a very non-judgmental approach with both the Mushi and the \"patients\" he meets focusing only on saving lives. This, in my opinion, preserves the more philosophical aspects of the show from pretentiousness. As it allows the viewer to interpret how right or wrong each character's actions were based on their own moral/philosophical views rather than have the \"right\" answer shoved down our throats like we seen so often in other anime (particularly shounen). Episode 22 in particular had a huge impact on me because of this.\
On the downside I felt he was a little to passive at points, even in the event of other character's deaths he showed little to no emotional reaction. \
ART [8] \
The real star of the visuals in this series is rural japan itself. The beautiful backdrops that make up this show, be it huge forests, mountains or rocky shores create an atmosphere for the show that I've never seen done so well anywhere else, even in Miyazaki films. The colour pallet is soft and the show carries a certain elegance purely from the art style, similar to how shows like 'Usagi Drop' pull off a simple yet sublime style.\
On the downside however many of the side characters look almost identical, particularly the men and boys as they all have short dark hair. This is because the art doesn't have the rainbow of hairstyle colours that other anime have relied on to differentiate the characters. Also some of the mid-distance shots do not have faces drawn on the characters which becomes very noticeable later on. The opening and ending visuals were also too plain in my opinion, particularly the latter.\
SOUND [9] \
One of the true tragedies of this show is that it has such a fantastic soundtrack, but most people will miss it almost entirely as it is so subtle throughout most of the show. For example each episode has a unique song as the ending theme that fits the tone of the particular episode perfectly (though the viewer is likely to deep in thought deciding their own take on the events of the episode to notice) This soundtrack combined with the aforementioned art style create an atmosphere I've never seen done as well elsewhere.\
ENJOYMENT [9] \
The show currently holds the number 7 spot on my all time favorite anime list. It is a must see for fans of shows like \"Kaiba\" and \"Kino's Journey\" (with those two being my alternate anime recommendations for those who have seen Mushishi) \

    For a episodic anime, which episodic shows do not usually carry my fancy, but for \"Mushi-shi\" this IS the best of the best in terms of episodic.\
The number one thing that makes it above all else is \"other world\" that it incorporates with the world as we know.  It brings it in quite nicely to where it seems natural, and they actually make it natural.\
Pretty much if an anime has excellent art, animation, then it should be a worth while anime.  \"Mushi-shi\" does not lack in the category, and might be the best for the amount of episodes and running time that comes\
          \
        with it.\
Anyways, definitely worth watching even for people who don't like those episodic animes.\

Besides, Ginko is also COOL!!! His white hair and marble-green eyes does it all.

One thing though, almost everyone inside besides Ginko look almost the same..(haha) The scenery is just PERFECT!! The settings of\

Mushi(s) also cause the anime to become wild. There is less scene of blood appear throughout the anime, but the peaceful pace is enough for everyone to enjoy it. Well, for the most, the settings is in JAPAN!! A nice and warm country for me...\
I also learned some good values from this anime. For me, nothing is good nor evil. Well, this anime also mentioned something similiar to that (not too same, but quite...) There is also the appearance of sakura and bamboo through the anime.. (nice) \
The last thing is, never hesitate if you are going to choose this anime. It is a MUST SEE ANIME for everyone. If you missed it, it will be a waste, because this is the masterpiece and the essence of pure anime...\

     You know how sometimes there comes along a film that just GETS you? But I mean, really really gets you? As though it didn't just completely understand you and your experience as a person, but in some way had evolved itself from your own thoughts or ideals?\
Well, for me, watching Mushishi is like breathing after a thunderstorm. Or like a refreshing cup of tea. It is passion condensed. It is a practice in meditation.\
Like the films of Kunio Kato or Miyazaki, the environment is what makes the film's story feel so full of life. Each story has a completely different energy from the last\
          \
        and yet one comes away feeling at perfect harmony and peace. One of the most impressive aspects of it, to me, is the use of sound - and particularly the quiet, the silence and what lies in between to fully capture and harness this energy and transfer it into moods. \
I love films where the real main characters are not our protagonists, but some outside force - such as the landscape, a background, the weather, a memory -  all of these are a shadow of something else. Something, maybe behind the scenes or possibly a thing that is yet to come. And in this anime, for me, the utilization of sounds and silences, particularly silences, were what made up my real main characters. \
For me, the Mushishi were like the interpretations that represented the different forms of these sounds and silences. (Who knew there was more than one kind of silence, but in a moment of one's deepest reflections?) And being able to see and hear all the varied manifestations of each gave every episode a kind of ...atmosphere. A kind of PLACE, in the world it had made, as well as my own. \
It was as though the film took all the moments from my life that had included silence and reflection; every memory I had associated with a sound (snow, a moment in the sun, the smell of a library or an old book,discovering you have  found a person whom you really love, the enjoyment of a real conversation, pudding) and documented them into these stories that although completely separate in chronicle, in feeling were utterly similar. \
This anime is phenomenal in every sense of the word. But, honestly, I would only consider watching it alone or with those whom you feel complete trust with because it can leave one feeling somehow exposed, which we soemtimes like to guard from most. I can only think of possibly three, maybe four, others in the world I could be near while watching this. And even then, I might be wary.\

    I'm not big on storytelling or diving into spoilers. So my review is plainly based on how I felt about each subject.\
Story:\
For being so complex, Mushishi sure has a wonderful simplistic storyline. Each episode is a story. That's the first thing to mention about this oddity; diamond in the rough. Hardly any episodes connect with one another besides focusing on our main character and the world around him. It isn't until later that some prolonged story comes into play which even so doesn't really move forward that much. The story in my opinion is what I really enjoyed about this show. Every episode has me\
          \
        feeling excited about what journey I'll go on next. New characters appear every episodes and little by little it will start to uncover all the endless situations the anime can be placed in. You won't really understand completely until you check out the first few episodes.\
Animation:\
The animation isn't grand or spectacular. It's plain and it is beautiful. Mostly all the characters look similar or even too much alike which is the only con. It isn't the focus of the show, but it melts and flows well with the concept. The art is what makes the series fit together. If it changed, well it wouldn't feel like Mushishi. It's basically watching a moving painting the entire time which seriously puts you into a trance. Stunning.\
Sound:\
Sound & music are a big focus for me when I dive into a series. If music stands out or really calls to me, I remember that. With Mushishi though, the music is so subtle you hardly notice. As the same with the animation, the sound blends together to fit nicely and overall make a great work. I'd say Mushishi is definitely more of a 'sound' anime then a 'music' type of anime. That's all it is...sound.\
Characters:\
A lot of people have an issue with this show based on the fact that the characters don't stick around. The only main character we have is Ginko, who by all means can run this show and do a hell of a job. Honestly, I enjoy peaking into the small parts of episodic characters lives and then leaving them just as Ginko did. It truly places you in his perspective. The series does it well because it doesn't need more than a few characters because it mainly focuses on spirits (Mushi) whom do show up every episode and I feel that our connection with the Mushi are more important. \
Overall: \
Overall, Mushishi has made it to my Top 3 if not my Top 1. Now you might think my review is biased because I love this show, but because I love this show I can truly say it is worth the watch if you like this sort of thing. Mushishi is best watched alone, mainly because many people don't have the patience for it. I love the concept of the entire series and I feel I can connect well with it. I leave every episode feeling awe-inspired and with the wow factor. I always gain something beautiful after 20 some minutes and that in itself is grand. No other series makes me feel the way Mushishi does or comes close to giving me the peaceful, spiritual, and deep meaningful thoughts as this one does. I walk away with a 10/10. A masterpiece no doubt.\

    I first found this in the top 30 TV Series, and most of the time, the titles are there because they deserve it. So I thought that I should give this title a try, maybe it would turn out something as unexpected as Monster.\
The opening narration was something I took as it is. It just says what there is, and you should take it like what it says. And then the very beautiful opening followed, which was one of the few anime opening songs I chose not to skip. After watching the first few episodes, I got the same feeling that Kino's Journey had. The\

        anime did have a glimpse of how the main character started, but there was no real ending. Which is similar to Kino's Journey. \
This one depicts the same nature of humans in a fictional reality. Even if this series didn't have an ending, it did leave an impact on me. I did enjoy the fact that this series was 26 episodes, meaning I didn't feel, in any way, lacking in content. Although i do hope they have more episodes of this series.\

Mush-shi has no main plot and follow Ginko, the Mushi Master. Ginko is a laid back character who travels and helps people deal with problems caused by these Mushi.

I think what I enjoyed most about this anime is that each episode has it's own story, and you never really know what to expect in the next episode. Ginko reminds me of House, in such that he won't stop searching for an answer once a mystery is presented to him, and also how both of them use a lot of logic and an almost outside-of-the-box thinking style.\
I believe there's a lot you can learn from this anime, and I'd recommend it to anyone, including those who don't normally like anime.\

In 26 episodes you could however ask for a few more layers to the story, a twist or two and a main character not being as static as he is. Although clever, I find Mushishi a bit too easy too follow, making it less rewatchable than, say, Neon Genesis Evangelion.\

    This anime follows one character by the name of Ginko as he travels the land to research entities called \"Mushi,\" along the way helping out people and villages who encounter problems with them. I found this story to be brilliant. I watched this as I was new to anime and I found that it was the most interesting and different from others that I've watched. It gave me a very relax mood as I was watching it- it even made me feel a bit spiritual. As the story goes on you'll find who Ginko really is and his real reasoning for traveling- *spoiler start* he\
          \
        cannot stay in one place at once because he attracts Mushishi to him. *spoiler end* The story traps you in their world which in my opinion is fantastic. \
The art of the show is what you would see from older anime- but it is still very clean. The sound is great- I even have both soundtracks downloaded to my iPod, I listen to it almost daily. \
Overall, this is a fantastic anime. It sets itself apart from a lot of other anime because there is no major actions scenes or typical things you would find in other shows. I greatly recommend it to everyone who likes to really get into what they're watching- it will really capture you into Ginko's world. \

    This is a truly great anime. It captures a serene and calming vibe that I have never seen in anything else. The stories are so well written and timed that they become encapsulating. Each episode is different and independent so you can pick up the anime or drop it at any point but I doubt that after you watch the first couple episodes you will want to stop.\
This anime creates a whole environment that brings you into the world. The music, characters, and story have a way of making you feel exactly what the characters are feeling. Most of the time you feel isolated as\
          \
        the main character visits small towns removed from the world.\
There is a reason why this anime is ranked so high. It is incredible and everyone should see it.\

    Mushi are everything around us, they are the air, they are our dreams, and sometimes our fears. \
God, I love this anime. It's so soft in its words and how it just flows through each episode. it's the closest thing in anime to come to watching scenes of nature. The story is pretty much about a Mushi collector named Genkio. Not really the most energetic of main characters I've seen in other animes, but Mushishi isn't like other animes. \
Genkio's attitude towards people and situation's is calm and collective, just like the anime itself. Ayway, the story is about genkio, who goes around diffrent places,\
          \
        mostly each town he visits takes place during a diffrent time of season, it also sometimes seperates through many years. But he goes around a solves all these diffrent problems involving Mushi, some are funny moments, other are pretty creepy and others can be a beautiful and almost spirital experiance. \
The art in this is very very well drawn. The artist took his time to craft the perfect detail into everything, from the people, all the way down to the falling leaves in the forrests. \
All in all this anime really put me in the moment, its not full of action big boob bounty hunters or giant fighting robots. it's just here for use to sit back, relax and enjoy a good story and watch beautiful things on screen, because that's what it is, a beautiful anime.\
Take care everyone. \

    Not the most action packed anime, by far...But, still, interesting enough to keep me watching, the lack of an actual storyline made be a bit sad...There is some story to Ginko, the main character, but aside from that, you could watch any of the episodes really, without having seen any of the others, each episode is usually a stand-alone style story.\
The art though, the art is beautiful, and the characters, aside from the main character Ginko, can easily run together from the lack of physical detail between each one.\
All in all, a good storybook style anime, a decent cure to boredom, but if need that\

    I don’t think my irritation with over enthusiastic Studio Ghibli fans is any secret and I'm sure I have in the past got into arguments with various people in the pub because I didn’t like Spirited Away and they took offence (rightly enough) at my rather ad hominen deconstruction of Spirited Away's appeal. That’s not to say I think Studio Ghibli's output is bad, they have produced some phenomenal works such as Grave of the Fireflies, and some less amazing but still enjoyable stuff like Mononoke Hime (also as a random factoid a number of the people who went on to create Studio Ghibli were\
          \
        involved in the creation of Flight of Dragons). Really my dislike is of Studio Ghibli's western fans rather than the studio itself. Particularly fans who's exposure to anime primarily consists of Studio Ghibli's movies or Manga Entertainments early nineties rubbish and Studio Ghibli. Because it is rather grating to hear \"Oh wow X is the greatest ever I’ve never seen anything like it before\", because I’m sure if I had spent my life wiping my arse with sandpaper that I would think corrugated cardboard is the greatest thing ever and the pinnacle of arse wiping technology when more informed people would realise Andrex was the lord of rear end cleaning comfort (no idea why I went with such a scatological analogy). Now if you have tragically read the paragraph above I would like to apologise for (but am probably incapable of rectifying) my dickishly elitist attitude.\
Anyhow Mushi-Shi, if you liked Spirited Away because it was \"like a fairy tale\" or something similar then I would urge you in the strongest terms to watch Mushi-Shi, which from the very first note of the opening song on the very first episode draws you into a whimsical, fantastic world overflowing with the kind of other-worldly appeal that the best faerie-tales create. It also present a much more nuanced and adult view of the interaction between the fantastic and the mundane and the price it can cost each side. While it does whang of purple prose I would say that it’s a rather beautiful show, both in content and delivery (The anime series won grand prizes in the categories of television series and best art direction (for Takashi Waki) at the 5th Tokyo Anime Award competition held at the Tokyo International Anime Fair in 2006). Its always engaging and often moving, it’s probably one of the most memorable anime I’ve watched in some time \

    Mushishi is a series that is down to earth but at the same time magical in a way. The story is not really strung out in a chronological order. It is more a compilation of stories that Ginko the Mushi master experiences. The music is the first thing that you notice and you become immersed in the mini stories because of it. The art was good but the people in the stories began to look the same after a couple of episodes, to the point where I wasn't sure whether the illustrator wanted to do it on purpose or he didn't know how to draw\
          \
        any other way. Ginko, the main character, is really well done. he has a cool, \"nothing bothers me\" attitude. I also enjoyed his use of common sense in almost every situation. The supporting cast fills the traditional Japanese part so the series is still very believable. I found very few rough spots and I just loved how the writer incorporated the Mushi (monsters) into the everyday life of Japanese folk, and also explain certain life phenomenon that is caused by the Mushi. The story probably deserves an 8 overall but the idea of the series touched me personally.\

    Mushishi is a great anime for viewers with patience.\
It has everything a good anime needs and though it lacks action it still is great. Each episode tells a different story about peoples problems caused by mushi beings of pure life. The stories are told slowly but they don't get boring because each story has something comprehensible to all. Each story is similar in a way because deals with primitive fears of unknown common to every human being.\
Story is rather slow and you can't see a plot behind different episodes thou they have very similar themes. And even thou the story is bitty you can easily\
          \
        follow it. \
Art is beautiful and detailed I especially enjoyed colors because the main colors of the series are green black and white you can see them everywhere and they have various meanings behind them.\
Sound was beautiful the opening song is my number one right now and the soundtrack overall is just wonderful. Each episode has it's one musical theme based on the sounds of nature. And even thou the music made a good impression on me it wasn't very outstanding sometimes I barely noticed it.\
Characters are interesting they have sometimes queer habits and tempers. But I was disappointed of characters appearance. Most of the female characters were almost identical.\
Sometimes it was hard for me to really enjoy this anime because it requires lots of concentration and thoughts.\
Overall I think it's a great anime for experienced watchers also for those who like to listen for tales legends about gods and demons also for those who enjoy something slow paced and requesting a bit of mind work.\
And I really recommend this anime for those of you who loves nature ^_^   \

    It is quite difficult to list and quantify what makes Mushishi so damn good. As a prelude, one can start with the particular pace it has: you either love it or hate it deeply. While this is already a massive turnoff for the public who's looking for an action-riddled anime, those who have the time, patience and mindset to enjoy the relaxing atmosphere will be more than glad. \
The level of self-containment that each episode has gives the spectator the ability to watch it all completely out of order and don't miss out too much, considering the only recurring character is the protagonist. Every episode\
          \
        is able to tell an amazing story of how Ginko deals with conflict - and every single individual storyline manages to catch you like some sort of strange Discovery Channel documentary.\
The artwork and soundtrack do a beautiful job in setting the atmosphere - the green tones of the background and the soothing lines that shape each character goes perfectly with the calming, almost era-fitting soundtrack.\
Ginko, the protagonist, has a personality fitting the soothing ambient, while still keeping a degree of badassery and assholery worthy of comparison to Gregory House - while still not doing much and fixing every single conflict within one episode. The subtle attempts each episode makes to rebuild whatever of Ginko's unknown past leave the viewer hungry for the next episode. \
Somehow, the level of self-unwrapping and the particular setting of this piece makes it unique amongst others. Only by watching the opening you get this pleasant melancholic bliss that continues to follow throughough the episode. ",

    I just finished watching Season 1 Episode 12 of Mushi-shi! \
(please read with caution, if you haven’t seen this show by this episode read with caution)\
One-eyed fish\
According to Netflix this show is an “award-winning’ phenomenon, basically about a Mushi, (like the food), walks around solving; afterlife phenomenon. You start to wonder about the one eyed blonde man, then episode 12 comes, the one eyed fish, there is a subtle hint to this middle cliffhanger that I hope will conclude.\
It starts by episode ____________________ you learn about a mushi that is creating a problem in a young girl’s life. The story line finishes\
          \
        well and gives you one settle hint; you would never know this if you missed this show. I very much enjoy the scene with the moon light and the young girl. When ginko catches the mushi, and what he does…\
Now, episode 12, comes and you learn what subtle hint he was talking about, basically a Kinko with brown hair. You find out answers to his one eye, and his ferocity for understanding muchi.\
P.S. Thank you, Yuki Urushibara, for creating this wonderful anima, it made me believe that anima art is more than just monsters with armor. The story line is very important. I will continue to watch. \

    Amazing anime on all forefronts. Great animation, great story, great pace with the episodes. I only have two complains: \
1. there were a couple of episodes that lacked, but I believe the reason I felt those episodes lacked were because they were not as intense as the others. Seeing as the anime has one of the best first episodes I've ever seen, it set the bar pretty high on what I expected from rest of them.\
2. I wanted some more background/character development on the main Character. \
That's doesn't mean the main character isn't kick ass, its just you finish the anime wanting more info on\
          \
        him. IMO you understand more the episodic characters more than you do the Main.\
 I would suggest this to any one regardless of their preferred genre and age.  \

    Episodic, intriguing and extremely well produced.\
PLOT: Mushishi is 26 episodes long and its completely episodic, consisting of numerous mini arcs covering the various mushi and how they affect different people. The link between each arc is Ginko, the titular mushishi (an expert on mushi), who travels throughout medieval Japan plying his trade. To me the most interesting thing about Mushishi is the fact that both mushi and humans are shown in shades of gray – neither is inherently good or evil, they are simply doing what they can to survive. There are some quite sinister mushi covered over the course of the series and I\
          \
        found those arcs to be the most memorable due to the disturbing nature of them. There aren’t always happy endings for the humans who come into contact with the mushi – death or disfigurement is fairly common.  Ginko for his part respects the mushi’s right to life and wont always help out the humans affected by the mushi if it will result in the mushi’s death, and I really liked this aspect of the series. Ginko is a truly intriguing character – he’s an anomaly within the series appearing to come from a different time period with his clothing and constant smoking, and his attitude towards both humans and mushi is that of live and let live.\
ANIMATION: Now I had heard of Artland before, they’re quite a small studio, but by a mile Mushishi is their best anime IMO. The backgrounds are simply gorgeous; the attention to detail and variety of the landscapes is wonderful. I also loved the simplistic character designs and the varied designs for the mushi themselves. It’s an attractive anime.\
MUSIC & VOICE ACTING: The OP is in english and its a very calming number. The BGM is quite atmospheric and really fits the tone of the series well – I wouldn’t listen to it without the visuals though, its definitely more mood setting than stand alone pieces of music. Ginko is main character and he’s voiced by Yuto Nakano who does an excellent job. The supporting cast is also great even though most only are about for one or two episodes.\
Overall Mushishi is a very atmospheric and fairly slow paced anime. The show that is most similar to it is Kino no Tabi as both have that episodic nature with some quite disturbing episodes, Mononoke also has similar themes. I’d highly recommend this series to anyone who liked Kino or Mononoke.\

    Mushishi,a masterpiece in many ways.\
Story-10:Mushishi is about little creatures called Mushishi that seem to be causing problems for some villagers.The only person that can get rid of them is a Mushishi Master.The Mushishi Master,Ginko,goes to villages to help out the villagers.Every episode is different,has a unique Mushishi,and leaves you with plenty of emotions whether it's sadness,fear,or joy.Each Mushishi comes in different forms and have different ways of affecting people whether it's physical or mental.My favorite episode is the second episode because if I were to rate that second episode,it would get a 10 from story through enjoyment.\
Art/Sound-10:Everything about the art was wonderful.The Mushishi look very\

        nice when you see them especially  in a pack.The music went well with the tone of the scene.The noise that you also hear when some of the Mushishi appear is amazing to just like in episode 2.\

    Indeed, the world is filled with unknown life forms which are why supernatural stories are such a big hit to any kind of viewers. \
I’ve always love stories about supernatural things particularly Japanese folklore. Plus, this series is an episodic type of series so you could say that watching this series is like a jackpot for someone who’s been watching animes for so many years like me. I just love episodic series because it always gives you a new different excitement that comes in every new chapter. And because it is episodic, there is no specific plot in the story. It is really just a\
          \
        compilation of different amazing stories. The drama for every story is nicely expressed. It is not too heavy or dramatic. Even when the ending of a specific story is tragic, the drama is not overly done. And I like that the endings are not always a tragic one. All the important elements of the series are well expressed and not just the mystery or supernatural part. But what I love the most is that the mysteriousness that comes with every new story. It is something to look forward to. Whenever a chapter ends, you anticipate the next one because you are assured that it will be an amazing one like the others. You also learn something in every story so it is very knowledgeable. It’s like learning Japanese folklore even more. The lines or dialogues are nicely done as well, its’ like listening a story from an expert storyteller. Somehow it gives an extra excitement to it.\
Because it is episodic and does not have a particular plot, there are only very few recurring characters. But even with Ginko being the only one who we constantly see, it is enough because he is packed with so much mysteriousness. Even if knowing that the series does not have a plot, you somehow wish to know more about Ginko. His enigmatic personality makes him a very likeable character. Well, almost all of us just love the characters that make us so curious about them.\
I am so amazed how the supernatural things or phenomenon are illustrated. It somehow has the Japanese touch to it. You can really feel that it is Japanese supernatural stories. Let’s not forget how the sounds matches well with the type of element this series has. It makes the series very supernatural and very Japanese like. The sounds give the series more mysteriousness into it.\
There are very few supernatural series that would really make someone interested in the series. Some would be too simple to make it interesting enough and some would be too complicated because it is so far-fetched. This series manages to balance everything and so nothing is overly done. You would genuinely appreciate every moment of it and elements that the series has. It is no doubt one of the best as of today. This is one of the very few that I truly wish would continue to air for so long. ",

    Mushishi  is a very unique anime. The episodes can be watched independent of one another, however there is a main story line throughout the series but isn't so heavy that you need to see them in one after another. I would recommend watching the series through and through first off, but after that you are much more free to just pick an episode and relax.\
Relaxing is one this this series portrays to me, personally, the theme song is on a  a few music playlists of mine, the show doesn't portray gore or violence (at least on the terms of standard anime), the messages\
          \
        and symbolism of each episode is unique and non-extremist.\
The English dub is above average, the main characters voice actor is someone many people are very familiar with and fits the role perfectly.The animation quality is amazing, it gives off a feeling of somberness (which fits it very nicely).\
Watch this anime to take a break from all the others, you won't regret it. It's a very hope inspiring anime at that.\

    This anime is a show  of the basic life forms of the world.  They sorta look like ghost jellyfish lol It goes down to the way  of everything being together no matter how different. It is peaceful,relaxing, riveting and hypnotic with it's background art of the forest and nature scenes\
. The story is of a man named Ginko(  my brother thinks he is the coolest!)  who is a mushi shi master. This mysterious traveler goes around to small rural villages helping people who are inhabited with Mushi shi problems. Either a unbalance happened to the area by disrespecting the nature\
          \
        or somebody was sensitive to them.\
It starts with a quirky folksy song called  the Sore Feet song for the opening with beautiful green forest. This anime is a mix of thriller and a little gross sometimes like when a girl starting coughing up feathers but otherwise it is sweet and epic! The character Ginko is the main character and the only character who stays around the whole time. In the manga they explain why Ginko's hair is white and he is missing a eye but the anime never really tells why. He is laid back and serious about protecting the people.\
This anime won tons of awards and also has a movie with a hot real live actor hahah XDD  It also has a video game! This anime is great to watch late at night  with it's quiet music and pretty colors. Just check it out X3 Sorry I can't really much more it's just really hard to describe.\

    mushishi is a 26 episodes  anime based on the manga of the same name , it's not the same thing someone would expect from any other anime out there , mushishi is unique , beautiful and extremely enjoyable anime that tells the story of Ginko ( the only main caracter ) who is a sort of savant , a doctor , a researcher in everything related to mushi , mushis are the basic life form who may behave as parasites , cause maladies , affect people psychology ... , and throughout the anime , Ginko travels over japan to help people solve their mushi\
          \
        problems , don't get it wrong , Ginko is not a god , and there were a fair share of problems he could not solve , and that adds to his caracter and the emotional structure of every episode \
speaking of caracters , even though Ginko is the only main caracters in this episodic anime , every episode had new people with different personnalities and dilemas , the developpement of Ginko's caracter is really well done ( I won't spoil anything here ) , and this anime is very emotional \
the art suits the theme perfectly , animation is flawless and landscapes are a joy , when is comes to sound , i've never seen such a huge collection of atmospheric music gathered in one anime , every ED is different that the other , The OP is the same english song but it's very enjoyable , voice acting is top notch , it's clear that the guys working on this anime put really high standards when it comes to animation and sound\
When it comes to story , it's something new , innovative , unique  but there is only one complaint , and that is that not all manga chapters were adapted to this anime , we really would like the rest to be adapted into anime ( maybe second season , let's hope )\
overall , mushishi is a master piece that every anime fan should see , just go watch it now , you'll not regret it\

This series is really amazing, these episodes are not just about some fantasy\
stories, they are about peaple, relationships and 'lessons for life'. It is pretty hard to explain!\

      description = "Ginko employs himself as a Mushi master (mushishi), traveling from place to place to research Mushi and aid people suffering from problems caused by them. \
 Ginko is a rare person who attracts mushi. This inspires his peripatetic lifestyle; staying in one place too long will gather a potentially dangerous amount of mushi. He also smokes constantly in order to keep mushi away.\
 \
 In terms of personality, Ginko is rather laid back, but can be very serious when it comes to protecting people from mushi. He also often stresses that the mushi are not evil, but they merely exist as a part of the nature and try to survive like every other living being.\
 \
 When Nui found him, he was unconscious in the woods, wounded and abandoned. As he had no place to go, Nui decided to care for him instead of making him leave. He went by the name \"Yoki\" until Nui was consumed by the Ginko mushi. Yoki lost his memory and was forced to take a new name because of the nature of the Ginko mushi, thus changing his name in the only thing he remembers, \"Ginko\"\
 Ginko's unusual white hair and green eye color is the result of an incident involving a mushi that occurred when he was a child.\
 He lost his other eye and hair color when he tried to save Nui from the Ginko mushi that lived in the pond near where they lived. Nui protected Ginko by telling him to offer them as a sacrifice so the Ginko would let him be. He never saw Nui again and after nearly being consumed by the mushi he adopted the name Ginko to save himself.\

But a mushishi of the Karibusa family sealed this forbidden mushi inside herself, turning her skin the color of ink and eventually killing her. But not before she had a child. \
 Since then, one in every other generation of the Karibusa family has carried the forbidden mushi inside them, rendering part of their bodies ink black and useless. But they have learned how to bind it. By listening to stories of the death of other mushi, they can subdue the forbidden mushi and use its mark like ink to write these stories down and seal the forbidden mushi away on paper. Those who do this are the Recorders. They live in an isolated house with their records, visited only by the family and mushishi.\
 \
 Karibusa Tanyuu is the fourth Recorder. The curse is located on her right leg, and she has learned to be skillful at moving on crutches and hopping on one foot. And in spite of the pain that this forbidden mushi constantly causes her, she loves and respects mushi, all forms of life. She is proud but kind, and there is no one who could do her job more effectively.\
 \
 Tanyuu's deepest desire is to complete the sealing away of the forbidden mushi, and to be freed to travel with Ginko.\

  synopsis = "\"Mushi\": the most basic forms of life in the world. They exist without any goals or purposes aside from simply \"being.\" They are beyond the shackles of the words \"good\" and \"evil.\" Mushi can exist in countless forms and are capable of mimicking things from the natural world such as plants, diseases, and even phenomena like rainbows. This is, however, just a vague definition of these entities that inhabit the vibrant world of Mushishi, as to even call them a form of life would be an oversimplification. Detailed information on Mushi is scarce because the majority of humans are unaware of their existence. So what are Mushi and why do they exist? This is the question that a \"Mushishi,\" Ginko, ponders constantly. Mushishi are those who research Mushi in hopes of understanding their place in the world's hierarchy of life. Ginko chases rumors of occurrences that could be tied to Mushi, all for the sake of finding an answer. It could, after all, lead to the meaning of life itself. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
