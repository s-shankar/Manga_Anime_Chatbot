		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=80,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Before the \"what the fuck is wrong with you, a 5 on a ghibli movie, kill yourself\" settles in, I want to assure you that the movie did everything that it set out to be outstandingly and if I was from that target audience, I would probably consider it nothing short of a masterpiece. I usually prefer to criticize a show for what it tried to be but failed while presenting every factor I deemed important about the movie and why eventually it was only an average experience for me. In this case, I don't have a lot to criticize on what the movie actually\n          \n        tried to do because it was succesful in what it did. So all I can present is what factored into my experience only a 5 with what the movie has had done and has not done.\nStarting with the movie's strong suits, the artistic side of it is outstanding. While the obligatory \"for its time, it looks incredible\" compliment must be said, I'll do one more and say that for our time, I wish people would pay as much attention to detail in animation as was done in Tonari no Totoro and would look at least half as good. The animation has plenty of small details throw in that makes each frame look lively and realistic. As an example there will be some scenes with children crying. Have you ever seen someone cry in an anime? I will assume that most of the time, depending on what you watch of course, crying doesn't rise any red flags. However, watching a child cry in this made me realize something. Most people don't even put any effort into the way they display someone crying and see it as something simple and easy to portray. However, in Totoro, when the child started crying I could see the range of emotions she went through and react realistically, the same way any child of that age would. All down to the point of starting to cry silently because she was upset then up to the outburst of emotion, screaming and bawling as soon as she was given attention again the way children do when they are given attention in these situations. It may seem a ridiculous thing to pick out the level of detail for animation, but that's what I found most impressive. The range of emotions displayed in a few frames was done as right as anyone could ever do them and I can't imagine someone outdoing this kid.\nOk, now the movie so far was 10/10 children cry real. Anyway, up next I'm gonna talk about, more of the art, and rather, its significance in this movie. You see there's a point to the art actually being this well animated and that is that its goal is to be as captivating as anything can be. Yeah, sure, anything has to be captivating, but in this situation, you have to keep in mind, the audience was intended to be children. Children are impressionable. And I assure this was artstyle was very impressive if it still is today back then. But the reason it also has to be captivating it is because it's trying to display the innocence of children, which is the artistic goal of the movie. Which it does. Quite well. To the point where everyone praises it. So I praised it on that front enough. But I have to add, since its audience seemed to have been children, it has build an impressive world with imaginative designs in a realistic looking manner. To the point where adults can watch it to feel like a kid again and children can watch it to be amazed by the movie's world.\nBut here's where my praise stops and my gripes with the movie starts... well... you see... I was bored. Yes, despite the amazingly looking visuals that occasionally made me so impressed I forgot all about how bored I was for a short while and despite being 100% on board with what the movie has displayed, I still was bored. Why? Because it is mostly comprised of the children fucking around and showing off how well designed everything is, as well as put focus on what they're trying to display in the movie. The movie piles on a lot and a lot of scenes together for artistic value and to continuously display how innocent a child is. I get it. So what?\nWhat do you mean \"so what?\", that's the point of the movie?\nYes, and why would I watch something solely meant to display that. Quite frankly, there's a lot of things intended for kids that are sweet, innocent and whatnot and have a point in their story, even if simple and meant for children to understand and teach them good values. However this movie spends an hour on children and then realizes something needs to happen as for the story to have some sort of tension by the point where you'd have ingrained the target audience into your brain and know everything's gonna be alright. The story is a tool to display art, rather than to display a engaging narrative.\nYeah, but the story's goal was to show off the children's innocence. It's only your fault if you can't appreciate that. \nYeah, finally something that we can agree. Frankly if you enjoy a movie that is artistic and the theme that I've described in the review, it will be outstanding. But do you enjoy stories? Do you enjoy it when you learn something? Do you enjoy it when you see someone have some sort of struggle and have some type of conflict? Do you enjoy it when something you watch tries to drive home a point or multiple points? Are you entertaining by these things? Because they are absent here. As a child or enough of a childlike mentality, you could admire and yonder or feel nostalgic over how your own childhood was due to the movie, but, if that's not what you're looking for... You're likely to get bored... just like me. Unless you're watching it for the amazing visuals. In which case, congratulations again.\nMost often times when something succeeds in what it sets out to be it is often free of criticism because there is no point to it because it's already succeeded. But just because it succeeded in something doesn't mean it will succeed in entertaining you. If narrative is something you really want in the movie, a series of connected events that do drive a point across, this is not something you should watch. If you value the artistic side of a show more than anything, this is a masterpiece that you should not miss, this movie is for you.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=155,  ["text"]="\n                          \n    Childhood is a blossoming period of learning and developing one's own idiosyncrasies. It has always been a sedate stage in which little youngsters define themselves through their senseless antics—ones that appear innocent but are of an elusive nature, and are merely an inadvertent expression of the capricious phase that is childhood. However, since kids are so full of youthful tendencies, very few directors have managed to portray the rascals in a sincere and realistic manner. But among those select few is an irreplaceable Ghibli film which has become a sensation both within its native community and the western world—and that film is Hayao Miyazaki's My\n          \n        Neighbor Totoro.\nMy Neighbor Totoro is, simply put, a child's imagination brought to life; fanciful tales that become reality, replete with picturesque wonders that reveal the magical and mysterious. Hidden from adult eyes, the otherworldly rewards only those of pure heart. Spirits and mystic guardians of the forest, they embody the creativity and candidness of children—content to experience the simple joys of life and the beauty of nature. With down-to-earth characterization, Satsuki and Mei are splendid lenses into the film's world, their optimism and enthusiasm ensuring every little discovery resonates with the audience—a magical tale that is an adventure for kids, and an opportunity to revisit childhood for adults; a genuine moment of reflection. \nAlthough the setting lacks depth, My Neighbor Totoro alleviates this by deftly weaving together fantasy and realism. Very little is explained and detailed, but its integration of the imaginary is both natural and unobtrusive. A big house nestled amidst greenery, uninhabited for decades, a likely home to the mysterious. Satsuki and Mei, true to their age, are explorers of the unknown—their interactions with the rich environment are not only a delight to observe, but also a reflection of the curiosity inherent within every child. \nUnveiled with mystique, uncanny soot creatures emerge from the house's floor and scamper into the shadows as the heroines enthusiastically tour the dark rooms of their new abode. Even if slightly scared at first, Satsuki and Mei's fear quickly gives way to curiosity, then excitement, and finally delight. The two adventurous sisters stumble upon a new world, and like any child would, wholeheartedly embrace its magic. This very sense of wonder is what leads them to the mythical spirit Totoro, protector and guardian of the forest. Intimidating in size, but gentle in nature, the fuzzy giant embraces the two of them with otherworldly tenderness. In an ever-so-subtle way, he becomes a link between the characters and the forest itself, introducing them to many of its magic wonders.\nIn essence, My Neighbor Totoro is more about inspiring one's imagination—an honest message about the importance of childhood and a connection with nature—than creating a fantasy backdrop. Complexity is absent, but the presentation is delivered with finesse and flair. Much of this is due to the laid-back pace and the amiable guidance of the protagonists, slowly hinting at the mysteries that may be hidden in the nooks and crannies of dark rooms and lush forests. All the viewer needs to do is to sit down, relax, and enjoy the magic unfold.\nAllowing their daughters the liberty to go and explore the surroundings of their new home, Satsuki and Mei's parents are often absent physically, but present in spirit. As caring guardians, the parents concern themselves with their troublesome daredevils in an earnest and honest fashion. These carefree dynamics connect the otherwise distant adult world with the children's, instilling a sense of trust and intimacy among the family. In this sense, Miyazaki makes a conscious effort of displaying human relationships in a sincere and natural style.\nTrue to Ghibli's reputation, My Neighbor Totoro's visuals are masterfully crafted with great attention to even the most minute details. Rich with body language and facial expressions, the screenplay succeeds in the art of showing and not just telling, breathing nuance and realism into the cast's actions and interactions. These subtleties add striking believability to the characters, as adults and children alike look and behave according to their ages. The physical environments, too, are vividly detailed, setting the stage for the integration of the cast and fantasy—be it the cluttered rooms of a house recently moved into, or the green vastness and richness of the countryside.\nLikewise, the film's sound department is remarkably well-polished. Joe Hisaishi's compositions harmoniously blend with the mood of the scenes—the tempo is upbeat in situations of excitement and discovery, while smooth when tension is low. The timing is delicate, but more than anything, the tracks themselves are what stand out most. Charming and varied, the melodic tunes make extraordinary scenes even more memorable. The careful management not only soothes body and mind, but also permits the soundtrack to lace key scenes with vivid and meaningful tonality. Interesting to note, though, is that for most of the movie, there is no background music. Instead, focus is placed on environmental sounds, allowing the countryside setting to weave its own atmosphere. In concordance with the naturalistic tone of the story, this adds a more organic touch to the presentation—one focused on painting nature in its purest form. \nA tale intended for kids, yet a journey fit for audiences of all ages, My Neighbor Totoro is a splendid story that encapsulates the beauty of childhood. The film's wonderful portrayal of Satsuki and Mei's imagination conveys a true sense of jollity present in most children. Beyond its realism, the film delivers a dazzlingly magical experience by way of its supernatural encounters with the manifestations of nature. But this occurs ever so gently, that one could consider it a dream-like tale that both begins and ends in blissful serenity. A true classic, My Neighbor Totoro will remain in the hearts of many as a heartwarming experience of one of the purest and most beautiful memories: a frolicsome childhood, never to be forgotten.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis review is the final product of a team composed of members from the \"Critics and Connoisseurs\" club.

I'd pop it in the VCR player (yes, old school, I know) and watching it with my little brother when I was a little girl. Somewhere around 14 years later, it's still my favorite movie, and probably always will be.\nTotoro's story is incredible: it captures the imagination of two girls with very different personalities. Satsuki, the older, responsible girl who takes care of household responsibilities while her mother is sick, and little Mei, a veritable firecracker who's curiosity knows no limits. What made this movie so incredible was how well it captured the imagination of kids their age.\n          \n        Just watching it makes you think back about all those fun things you did when you were younger, whether you're helping your parents with chores or you're outside picking acorns off the grass. I think thanks to this movie, I spent a good chunk of my childhood looking through bushes and trying to find crevices in trees so I could find where Totoro's house was! Ah, lots of memories...\nMiyazaki's artwork is stunning. Despite the fact that by now, it's obviously somewhat older, the animation is still superior to anything Disney can throw at us. His specialization in artwork of nature make this film a delightful piece of eye candy.\nThe music! How cute! The opening sounds like one of those little tunes my mother would sing to me in Korean when I was younger. I've always loved the music in Miyazaki's movies and this one is no exception.\nTotoro is easily still my favorite movie in the world for over a decade. Highly recommended to watch, rewatch, and watch with everyone else.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=36,   ["text"]="                          \n    Another win for Miyazaki!\nThe story was just unique. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen anything like it &ndash; and originality is always a good thing. It had me watching closely the whole time. It&rsquo;s a story for kids and kids at heart alike.\nIt was like watching a Dr. Seuss story come to life, except it has a Miyazaki spice to it. Another good thing about it is that it&rsquo;s easy to understand, but not so easy that it&rsquo;s dumb.\nThe characters were all very likable. I like adorable Mei, and her doting older sister Satsuki. I also love how their father is so child like &ndash; he&rsquo;s\n          \n        definitely not one of those stern looking dads. Finally, Totoro and is companions were fun to watch. I kinda want to meet him myself.\nAnd because it&rsquo;s a Miyazaki movie, you&rsquo;d expect that it&rsquo;s another well animated movie. Animation &ndash; wise, I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s his best work I&rsquo;ve seen, but the animation is still noteworthy. The movement was very fluid and the illustrations were all very detailed. It was like watching a Children&rsquo;s water colored story book in motion.\nThe music is also very nice. I like both the opening and ending themes, as well as the BGM. Everything was very upbeat and cheerful, definitely something kids would like to hear, but all tracks were very nicely done.\nIt&rsquo;s definitely one timeless story that rivals Disney&rsquo;s greatest works. Another must see from the genius known as Hayao Miyazaki.\n        "},

We often want to reminisce and look back on the better days, full of adventure and enjoyment. Well, this movie does an excellent job of bringing me back to that feeling. It is full of heart-whelming adventure, and exploration.\nI always seem to watch this movie or any Studio Ghibli film for that matter, when I am wanting to experience a child-like sense of adventure. Miyazaki does am excellent job of creating a world, in which you would love to explore and experience.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=23,   ["text"]="                          \n    My Neighbor Totoro is the flagship of Ghibli and one of the first Japanese animated feature films to receive wide critical acclaim in the west. As much as its successor 'Spirited Away' capitalized further in terms of revenue, Totoro stands as one of the most influential anime, with the ubiquitousness of Totoro plushies and pop culture references to it still present today. But there are reasons beyond its success that attributes it as a must watch on the checklist of any avid fan of anime. \nWhether this was your first anime movie as a newcomer, as a kid, or as a moviegoer, none can contest\n          \n        the brilliance of Miyzaki in developing a world filled with awe and wonder, boundless playfulness and imagination, whilst proficiently capturing the natural innocence and curiosity present in every child, conveying a true sense of realism in the most heartwarming way possible. It's impossible to come out of Totoro without a big smile of satisfaction while feeling peckish for more Miyazaki. \nI would call Totoro's aesthetics a marvel considering its time (1988), with the use of tradition cel animation (hand-drawn), adding to the film's fluidity and polish in the realm of character designs and scenery, altogether toning matrimonially with the \"friskiness\" the music orchestrates.\nMy Neighbor Totoro is not only a visual spectacle, but also encapsulates childhood in a little box. Even as a story tailor-made for kids, older audiences can still identify and project that sense of accomplishment after finding that four leaf clover or discovering an assortment of big acorns under that big tree, long long ago.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=22,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    I was down with the flu and I was curled up in my room, looking for something cozy to watch. Flipping through my collection, I suddenly remembered the My Neighbor Totoro DVD I had received as a gift a while back. Needless to say, I popped it into my player, sat back and had one of the most relaxing and peaceful 90 minutes of my life.\nMy Neighbor Totoro is hard to synopsize because of the tranquil and laid back first half. I suppose it would suffice to say that this classic 1988 Studio Ghibli movie is about the innocent fun of two little sisters who\n          \n        move into a house in a village, along with their father, only to find out that the picturesque place can be more mysterious than they thought. My Neighbor Totoro has bagged several awards over the years and helped bring Japanese animation into the global spotlight.\nThe basic driving force behind the story is this: Don’t you want to be a kid again? Don’t you want to go back to the days when your only responsibilities were to show up at school and be home on time? Don’t you want to look forward to each day, because there was always something new to learn, find and discover? This universal, yet eternally successful theme is what made My Neighbor Totoro click. The story is so beautifully crafted that kids look at this movie as the adventures of two sisters, while adults while adults perceive this anime to be a timeless classic that will forever remind them of their innocent childhood.\nAnother positive aspect of the story is that it’s character driven, but not in the traditional sense. Instead of developing the characters or making them take on hard decisions, this movie’s characters are the diamonds in the rough because of their simple and lifelike charms. They think, act and behave just like any curious and energetic children of their age would. The two sisters, Satsuki and Mei, are sure to inspire kids and bowl over adults with their sweet and loveable attitudes. The seiyu also deserve a lot of credit here, because they bring out all the energy and emotions necessary for their roles.\n If you were wondering why I didn’t make a mention of Totoro, the giant chubby ferret/forest spirit, it’s because he is (in my opinion at least) present for appealing to the kids and doesn’t really play an important role otherwise. A contributor to the entertainment (and cuteness, if you like) factor.\nI got my hands on a re-mastered DVD edition of this one, so I won’t be able to judge the quality of the original theatrical/VHS version. Still, you can’t make a good sculpture without good clay, so I think it’s safe to say that the art was outstanding. The backgrounds were very neat and looked exactly like a 1950s Japanese village. Characters were drawn in trademark Ghibli style, which is never a bad thing. A perfect ten.\nThe soundtrack added to the straightforward atmosphere of the show. Nothing fancy, just the good old piano. The OP, Stroll, was a nice upbeat song that reminded me of The Sound of Music, especially the English version.\nThis anime would get a sure ten from any kid who’s below 10, but looking at it from a more mature perspective, My Neighbor Totoro does have some minor issues which deny it the perfect score. Because of its age, it is rather predictable and I felt the mood swing from the lax and serene atmosphere from the first half to the more fast paced and fantastical approach to the second half was a little unnecessary. The fantasy aspect is played around with to please kids, but older viewers might not approve. The dialogue and script could’ve been a tad tighter too. But that’s about all the flaws I can come up with, after a lot of time I spent on nitpicking.\nRegardless of whether you’re a kid, adult, otaku, casual viewer or just plain bored, My Neighbor Totoro is most certainly worth your time. \n[  THE WRAP-UP ]\nMy Neighbor Totoro is a landmark anime that garnered critical appeal and international fandom. Although primarily intended for children, this 90 minute movie is bound to appeal to the taste buds of anyone, even if they’re not a big fan of anime. The story is uncomplicated and easy to watch, which is always a good thing if you’re looking for something nice and comfy. The undeniable charm of the characters also adds to the realistic atmosphere of this Studio Ghbili movie. Despite its release date, the animation is solid, just like the fitting soundtrack. My Neighbor Totoro is an anime that gained mainstreamed recognition and popularity for good reason. In other words, watch it. "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=18,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    What more can be said about My Neighbor Totoro? Get this movie. Immediately. Without a doubt one of the best animated features ever made, Japan or otherwise, Totoro is an outstanding original creation from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli.\nIt's about two sisters -- Satsuki and spunky little Mei -- moving with their somewhat scatterbrained but loving father to a new home in the Japanese countryside. But the place isn't just deserted; wonders galore lie within their household. Tiny, fuzzy black balls of soot ('Soot Gremlins', or 'dust bunnies', depending on which English version you watch--but more on that later) scatter every nook and cranny of\n          \n        the walls, frightened away only by laughter. A tall, luscious camphor tree towers above the other trees in the back yard.\nAnd, lastly, the Totoros themselves, absolutely adorable little creatures who look like a cross between a raccoon, rabbit, owl, and guinea pig (a personal bias here, since I owned such a pet who reminds me so much of the Totoros here), live in this very forest, carrying acorns, making huge trees grow at night, and playing ocarinas on the branches of the trees. There is even one really big Totoro who sleeps under the tree, so cuddlesome and gentle that you'll swear that he's the equivalent of your pet. Of course, he doesn't just allow Mei to snuggle on his chest. He lets out thunderous roars, shake the ground by jumping with full force, grins as wide as a Cheshire cat (albeit with warmth and generosity), helps others when they're in trouble, and gives acorns wrapped in bamboo leaves in return for gifts.\nArguably the most memorable creation in the movie aside from the Totoros is a giant, ginger-colored cat who takes on the form of a bus, with glowing yellow eyes for the headlights and twelve--count 'em, twelve--legs to roam around the countryside faster than the speed of light (I swear, I'm not making this up).  Like Totoro himself, he shares a wide, infectious grin showcasing generosity and warmth.  The Cat Bus only appears two times in the movie, yet every minute we see him in is a delight.\nWhat gives My Neighbor Totoro its heart is in the characterizations of the girls who propel the story as well as their family and neighbors.  Satsuki and Mei are portrayed as real, believeable children with their strengths and weaknesses.  Satsuki is the older of the two, and at times comes across as bossy, yet she is a sweet, caring young girl and obviously cares for her little sister.  Mei, the youngest, is also the most interesting--bursting with uncontrollable energy and curiosity just like any girl her age would; she constantly demands attention, occasionally competes with her sister, throws fits of frustration, and all around, absolutely adorable.  Their father, who, as mentioned, is a bit of an oddball yet very patient and supportive of his girls, cares for the duo.\nTheir next-door neighbor is Granny (Nanny), an equally loving and helpful old woman who comes to help the girls when their father isn't around.  Her grandson, Kanta, meanwhile, is that typical, impish young boy from everyone's childhood; he does not know how to deal with girls his age, and initially the best way he can communicate with Satsuki is to tease her, 'your house is haunted!'  Naturally, this begins a series of humorous scenes where we see the two of them exchange rude faces at each other.  Later on, however, when Satsuki and Mei are strolling home from school in the rain, Kanta shows by to lend them his umbrella, and even proves to be a true friend, especially during the finale.  Characters as interesting and well defined as this are what makes a movie (or Anime series, TV or OVA) gripping from start to finish, and like most Ghibli movies, My Neighbor Totoro's cast is the kind that one can identify with or relate to.\nThe story isn't all hearts and flowers, however. An emotionally charged subplot involving the sisters' ailing mother (shades of Miyazaki's personal life here) gives Totoro a dramatic edge. This is particularly evident in the third act, when the girls receive a distressing telegram about their mother. Both Satsuki and Mei are extremely traumatized by this as any real child would be if such a situation occurred in their lifetime.  Mei gets upset and throws a temper tantrum; Satsuki loses patience and lashes out at her sister.  Later Mei sets off for her mother's hopsital, igniting an intense yet understated climax where Satsuki and everyone else around the neighborhood tries to search for the missing youngster.  Of course, everything turns out happily, but not before these emotionally charged sequences pry tears from the viewer's eyes. This mixture of real-life situations, emotions, and magical discoveries found in your nearest back yard make Totoro feel authentic (even with its dreamy, childlike fantasy sequences). One cannot help but find this quality in any of Miyazaki's films, this one included. \nMy Neighbor Totoro was not a box office success in either Japan or America, but the film has won over millions of children around the world as well as animation buffs for its gorgeous animation style; the backgrounds are lavishly detailed and imagination is galore in much of the sequences. (It was Kiki's Delivery Service that would catapult Miyazaki's animation company, Studio Ghibli, into box office success status.)  As for the musical side of things, Joe Hisaishi supplies a very memorable score which recaptures the childlike innocence and wonder we see in many of the sequences; the theme for Totoro himself is infectiously catchy as is the bouncy march song over the opening credits.  And while it is sparsely used (and sometimes not as grand sounding as his later scores), Hisaishi's music, whenever we hear it, is a fitting accompaniment to the movie.\nThe movie was originally dubbed into English by Carl Macek and his infamous company, Streamline Pictures in 1993. Believe it or not, this was one of the 'best' dubs they've ever produced. As Disney has acquired the rights for Ghibli's movies, though, it was inevitable that they would produce their own version. This has infuriated many, but as someone who fell in love with Totoro with the Mecak version, I have to say that this new Disney production offers charm and emotion on its own ground.  The script is a fresh new translation from the original Japanese (clarifying the origin of Totoro's name), and remains faithful to the meaning of Miyazaki's screenplay, despite a few line changes here and there (nothing major, though).\nAt first, I was a little worried about hearing Dakota and Elle Fanning as Satsuki and Mei, but both ended up captivating me from the start; personally, I think it was great for Disney to cast two actual sisters to play the young girls--it helps their chemistry come alive. The other actors, including a warm, understated Tim Daly, and delightful Lea Salonga provide similarly top quality work. My favorite performances? Pat Carroll, displaying maternal charm and whimsy as Granny (not sounding anything like her most-famous role, Ursula from The Little Mermaid), and Frank Welker, who does outstanding vocal foley for both Totoro and the Cat Bus. The OP and ED songs have the same lyrics, but are sung by a different singer (Sonya Isaacs), who may please some and annoy others. I'm sure that there will be many who will draw comparisons between the two dubs to the very bitter end, but I think it's great to have more than one adaptation of a beloved story, especially when done by folks who obviously love Miyazaki's works.\nHowever you decide to view this film, however, My Neighbor Totoro is far from just another kid's story. With a little bit of luck, grown-ups (and those who consider themselves too 'sophisticated' for cartoons) will enjoy it too.\n        "},

Totoro has even become the mascot of Studio Ghibli, and even appears in the logo before almost every Ghibli film starts. There's no villain involved, it's just filled with delightful characters, memorable moments, and just pure imagination.\nThe two main characters Mei and Satsuki are played by real life siblings/actresses Dakota and Elle Fanning (Note, I did not see the 1988 version released by 20th Century Fox, I watched the 2005 Walt Disney redub.), who I admired most in the movie because they don't act like they're\n          \n        reading off a script or anything like that, but they act like actual siblings throughout, and that's the kind of charm that I liked in the movie. And since this a Studio Ghibli film, this one is brought to us by the head master, Hayao Miyazaki.\nThe two little girls are moving to a new house in a small village with their father. Their mother is in the hospital sick, so they wait patiently for her to come to their new home. As soon as they come in, they see specks of black dust that live in their attic, which an elderly nanny hired by their father explains that those specks of dust are soot sprites, and says that if you leave them alone or even make some laughter, then they'll go away.\nOne day, while the father is working at home, and the elder sister Satsuki is at school, Mei is seen playing around the new house when she comes across a small mouse/cat creature leaving trails of acorns. She follows it into the woods and goes into an imaginative part of the forest, and finds a gigantic version of that creature sleeping heavily, with no dialogue with the exception of a few grunts and the sounds of the words \"Totoro\".\nSatsuki returns home to find Mei sleeping in the real parts of the woods, and Mei finds that Totoro is gone. And unlike most kids movies where the family doesn't believe the younger sibling and thinks she was dreaming, they actually believe her and tell her that she met a spirit of the forest and says she can see the spirit whenever the spirit feels it wants to.\nThe story continues with adventures involving a local neighborhood boy who has a crush on Satsuki, a sad moment with the mother having to stay in the hospital for a little longer, and a scene where Totoro shows up next to the two girls waiting for their father to come home, while standing in the rain.\n\"My Neighbor Totoro\" is so charming and innocent, that's it's impossible not to love. You instantly fall in the love with the characters, and you can sympathize the siblings' behavior with each other if you have a younger or older brother. The animation and imagination are purely great. Miyazaki is one of the most influential animated directors outside of America and everyone should see all of them. I know I will!\n\"My Neighbor Totoro\" is a wonderful and remarkable family film.\n        "},

I can't make head or tail out of it.”\n-	Duck Soup\n\nSisters Satsuki and Mei love each other; as affectionate playmates, they grow under their scholarly father’s calm and accepting hand. He doesn’t dismiss their play, nor does he inflate it in the artificial way that adults do; he simply acknowledges their wonder, without rationalizations. The one shadow in this world awash with sunshine is that their mother can’t be with them yet. But Satsuki and Mei are growing up at a time when neighbors still come by to welcome newcomers and lend\n          \n        a hand, and the neighborhood grandmother is everyone’s grandma.\nAt its most lyrical, My Neighbor Totoro shows life as it floats, free and easy, in a stream of happiness. When a sorrow arises, it isn’t out of the blue; it’s an undercurrent running through the highest and lowest undulations of life. It can be answered by the staring, unblinking eyes of the largest and sleepiest of forest spirits. Mei takes to Totoro almost immediately, as a lark knows the morning. Satsuki is thankful for his companionship when she struggles to bear up as the big sister. At the darkest moment, a lithe and grinning cat can transport the frightened children to the tree nearest their longed-for mother. I think that is one of the messages in the after-scenes that accompany the credits: Totoro has magic because Father does finally come home on the last evening bus, and Mother really did just have a cold, and returns to shower Satsuki and Mei with her graces of fellowship and fun. It’s when Father and Mother fail – something as inevitable as death, really – that children develop the quiet and resolved endurance and effort which so enrich the world. But that’s another story, for a later time.\n\nThree obligatory comments:\nFirst, the animation. Satsuki and Mei explore every corner and crevice of their new home; they walk, march, run, and crawl on all fours through sunny rice patches and shaded forests. It’s as if nature itself is infused with a natural joy that never reproaches the children’s fun. Which, of course, it is; and his name is Totoro. \nSecond the music. I can’t remember the last time I watched an anime where the music itself was a character; when Satsuki, Mei and Totoro play together in that wonderful scene, the theme is heard in a full-throated orchestral fragment, as if it were “the overflowing of brim-ful gladness.” Feeling lethargic or blue? The opening theme (“Totoro, go, go, go! Energetic! I like walking most”) serves as an animated companion. \nThird, the voice characterizations. The dubbed version with the Fanning sisters sounds interesting. In reality, the universal themes and expressive and thoughtful character designs of My Neighbor Totoro speak for themselves. When the wind beats against the roof, bangs the pots and rattles the doors, the family’s boisterous belly-laughs fill more than the animation – it rolls over into the three dimensional world and straight into the heart. \nGrade: A"},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="                          \n    STORY: My Neighbor Totoro is simple and whimsical. Although the story is a children's fable, the heart of the tale can draw out the child in everyone. The movie begins in a period of transition for a family, and the movie concludes alongside the end of the transition. The finished product is like a meaningful photograph. The events occurring in the story or picture are not life changing. It's the memory and feeling you take away that holds the worth of the story in Totoro. However, the story is not ground-breaking or awe-inspiring.  But the it is delightful and unforgettable.\nART: Consistent, good quality in\n          \n        animation can do wonders for the experience, and this work is another fantastic example of Studio Ghibli's dedication to their art. The scenery in the film is immersive, and the world painted before our eyes is just out of reach, detached pleasantly from reality. The animation is not on par with the works Ghibli produces today, but the animation is still fantastic.\nSOUND: The voice acting is good, and the sisters' actors are pleasantly convincing. However, their father always sounds less happy than he appears. Also, the acting for the different Totoro sounds too human for their completely non-human appearances. Although there won't be many musical moments that will stick with you after the viewing, the music is charming and fits perfectly with the events taking place. The show's audio succeeds in making this already joyous world more delightful.\nCHARACTER: The characters of Totoro are relentlessly likable. Even though there is little character development, the everyday life appeal of these characters is so genuine and endearing. Yet as fun as these characters are, the lack of character progression leaves a longing for more. The glimpse into their lives is all too brief, which can be good and bad, showing just how attached you can become to this little family. Yet this element is a slight detriment to the power and draw of each character. \nENJOYMENT: Totoro is utterly delightful. The show is meant to put the viewer into the best mood possible, and it succeeds on many levels. The scenes are creative and curious and the characters make you laugh and smile. As endearing and involving as the show can be, the plots avoid hitting on the heart strings and emotions. Thus, at no point does the show place the viewer in suspense and tension, allowing the show to be pleasantly blissful.\nOVERALL: My Neighbor Totoro is a movie brimming to the rim with fun and games. What really makes Totoro work is how openly the film acknowledges its simple, child-like style. Sometimes overly optimistic titles can overwhelm viewers with unrealistic and unnecessary happiness. With Totoro the film is happy but not overly so. There is realism within the fantastical here, and that realism makes the joy and laughter genuine, grounded, and accessible. My Neighbor Totoro is a story for all ages within the vessel of a children's fable.\n        "},

Well then, you've been missing out!\n\"My Neighbour Totoro\" is a delightful film that most young children - as well as a good proportion of older viewers - are sure to enjoy. It's not a particularly deep film, nor a particularly exciting film. At the heart of it, it's a simple tale about a family relocating to the countryside\n          \n        and the children meeting some weird and wonderful creatures, but it is so much more than that. The magic is in the characters, for \"My Neighbour Totoro\" is filled with some of the cutest, most iconic characters in anime. And amongst these unforgettable characters, it's the big, adorably fluffy King Totoro himself that steals the show, so it's fitting he is somewhat of a mascot for Studio Ghibli the way Mickey Mouse is for Disney.\nFantastically weird non-human characters maybe a trait in Miyazaki films, but so are rather less interesting human ones, and \"My Neighbour Totoro\" inherits both of these traits. The human character has a familiar look about them, as though they're the bloodline relatives to the characters from other Miyazaki movies. Then there's the much used tomboy girl and the boy who wants to make friends with her set up that Miyazaki so likes to use. However, in the midst of these recycled characters, I do like Mei, who's like the adorable little sister that everyone would love to have.\nLike a lot of other Miyazaki films, \"My Neighbour Totoro\" does contain a dose of the usual environmental messages, but this isn't Miyazaki in one of his more preachy moods. In this film, the message isn't forced upon us, instead it is gently conveyed across by opening our eyes to the wonders of life. Totoro himself is like a kind of guardian of the forest, doing rain dances, making the trees spring up, all in a very lovable manner. For sure, a lot of the stuff is made up - obviously, in reality there are no creatures like Totoro that can perform miracles such as accelerating the growth of trees etc, but beneath all the imagination, the feelings and the message themselves are very genuine. This is helped along by the beauty of the artwork - I may not be a fan of Miyazaki's human character designs, but the beautifully drawn natural scenaries are as stunning as always.\nEven though this is film is rather uneventful - there aren't really any particularly dramatic or epic events, but it succeeds because there's a sense joy that's prevalent throughout. For instance the scene where Mei bounces up and down on the fluffy belly of Totoro, and another where rain drops falls repeatedly onto the nose of a rather dopey looking Totoro... these are all simple scenes, but they're scenes that are bursting with pure, innocent charm. It's these little things that makes \"My Neighbour Totoro\" a bit special, and it's these little things that makes it one of my favourites from the Ghibli collection. \n        "},

You just knew.\n~ ENJOYMENT ~\n       Definitely enjoyable! Loved every minute of it when i was younger and when i watched it again when i was older.

This is due to his numerous animated works that he creates with the brilliantly creative staff at studio ghibli. What makes their films so appealing us their ability to appeal to both adults and children alike. My Neighbor Totoro definitely does not dissapoint when compared to other anime films in existence. \n Tonari no Totoro, also known more commonly as My Neighbor Totoro is a simple story about a family moving into the country side and meeting several spirits of the forest. One of these spirits\n          \n        is known as Totoro and he lives in a tree near their house. The story sounds simple but the execution makes it so special. \n As I just mentioned the story is very simple but this fact does not detract the film's quality at all. The film oozes with creativity wherever they can cram it. I love the design of the spirits and the creative premise in particular. The story has a sense of whimsical charm that children and the little kids in all of us can surely appreciate. \n The setting isn't all that unique but is utilized well. The theme of different spirits being present works with the setting. This would not have worked if the story had taken place in say New York City. The rural setting also gives off a good and peaceful atmosphere throughout the entire film.\n The movie's conclusion was very satisfying and there was some great resolution present. The film did not seem very long or short winded as the running time runs just outside of the average movie running time at 1 hour and 26 minutes. The comedy was also well done and there was some quality and realistic drama present. So overall the narrative of this movie is amazingly executed. \n The characters were also quite solid in this film. The characters were all very likable and were put in believe able situations. Characterization and development were present and we did get to know the characters. The characters also captured child like whimsy and fun while also maintains realistic family dynamics.\n Totoro is an absolute beast, he was very sweet and funny despite his scary aesthetic appearance. He can be described as a gentle giant. The adults in this story were good too, the mother who was in the hospital still had a good attitude about it. The father had a very fun and believeable relationship with his daughters. And granny provided wisdom when the time was needed. And do I even have to say anything about the cat bus? The characters were overall a massive hit.\n The only real problem I had with this film were some of the presentation. The animation in this film was good but not great. I really liked the use of color and the fluidity of the animation. However some of the animation was reused and the animation had aspects that didn't age a whole lot well and just looked awkward at some points in the film. \n The soundtrack here was very good and went along with the film's atmosphere very well. The English dub was also pretty well executed with some annoying voices peppered throughout the film at different points. I would like to see the sub version because the father's voice actor is the same as someone who worked on the mother series of video games. \n So overall My Neighbor Totoro was a great experience. It succeeded with quality characters and a fun story. There weren't too many significant flaws and it is another great film from Stidio Ghibli. This movie succeeded in making me feel like a little kid which is a very rare occurrence indeed.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    It would seem easy for the newcomer to dismiss Totoro, or any Ghibli film for that matter, as a saccharine film with its head stuck in naivety. I mean, just look at those title sequences! Both the opening and ending ones! The deceivingly playful music would probably lead the inexperienced viewer away from what sensible wisdom this film provides for the young and old. They're not called family films for no reason.\nFor example, at the beginning of this film, Satsuki notices a cyclist in uniform and is relieved that he's not a police officer. Naturally, my first thought jumps to, \"Is this family in trouble?\n          \n        Perhaps running away from the law?\" Of course, I soon remember the simple notion that kids merely find officers to be intimidating on some level, proving my long-departure from a child-like perception. Later on, Satsuki and her (very) little sister, Mei, are playing around a rotting pillar beneath a porch, and I found that act dangerous. The two kids have no such reservations and continue to fool around as they place. So yes, the observation of children can bring you interesting perceptions that you might not know.\nAnd it helps that Miyazaki has a great reputation for depicting realistic people. Many years later in life, there will be an infamous misquote about how Miyazaki claimed that \"anime is a mistake\". What he actually said was that a lot of anime artists these days have ceased to observe people in real life as they depict these characters, that the anime industry now belongs to the otaku (literally meaning \"shut-in\", the kind Americans stereotype as living in their mother's basement). While I don't agree with the statement in its entirety (any generalization is bad, and this is no exception), there are few people more qualified to make such a statement than Miyazaki himself.\nThe truly impressive feat is to not just depict children realistically, but realistic and interesting. Children in movies are usually noisy, obnoxious, and attention-deficit. It's easy to depict children as such because most children act like that in real life. But it takes a certain kind of skill to strike a fine balance between realistic and compelling. How do you engage the audience with real children?\nMei is adorable enough little kid that I could just eat her up by the end of the movie. At one point, I was a bit worried she might turn into a Mary-Sue. I mean, she's pretty hardy for what seems like a 5 year old. I know kids older than that who would cry after smacking their face onto a bush. She's also curious, jolly, and active in a playful, unobnoxious way. When she meets Totoro later, she isn't afraid, even when it seems like she is going to be swallowed into the 'jaws of death', but instead strokes the giant creature gently and with compassion. She's pretty much the ideal child every loving parent would want. But it's revealed in the later half of the movie that she keeps herself from crying to act like a \"good girl\", a habit many kids tend to pick up (I obviously didn't). Also, she throws a tantrum when she receives news from a telegram that their ailing mother would not be discharged from the hospital for the week. All of these further evidenced her innocent altruism for others, but it does show her more human and vulnerable side. It is in these kind of moments that I sometimes can't help give into my more cynical observations about how these 'kind-hearted' kids appear too often in cartoons for my taste. There's a struggle watching these family films where I have to remind myself not to be judgmental, and Miyazaki does make it easier by making both girls such likable characters. In fact, the film spends a large amount of time keeping me watching by merely establishing and developing the two girls without rushing to the main plot or its eponymous character, a bold trait compared to your modern Hollywood filmmaking.\nThere are two persistent themes that one might observe throughout Miyazaki movies. The first is that children are precocious, and their innocence would allow them to get in touch with the supernatural much easier than adults. The children's father, Tatsuo, in particular, is unable to see Totoro and the enormous tree that magically sprout overnight, leading me to almost believe the more commonsensical notion that the children are merely seeing delusions or perhaps trapped in a dreamscape. While guileless children connecting with Mother Earth via their shining innocence isn't exclusive to Miyazaki films, the theme that truly sets them apart is the relationship of man and nature (particularly the acts of deforestation), a theme that might put off some of the more superficial audiences like myself, especially when it becomes heavy-handed and preachy in its symbolism (Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, Spirited Away). In Totoro, however, this doesn't become a distraction like in other Miyazaki films, and is merely a gentle backdrop serving to enhance the overall beauty of the movie.\nWhile such themes can easily succumb to darker subjects such as man's greed for self-gain, or the adults' dismissal of 'childish' ideas they've long outgrown, Miyazaki takes a particularly innocent approach to Totoro that permeates in its adult characters too. The father is practical but understanding and patient, and the mother is of course soft-spoken and indulges in the children's fantasies like she is one of them. As opposed to a film like The Orphanage, you could hardly see the realism in these adults at all. I should commend Miyazaki's effort in consistently looking towards the benign and innocuous, but this is one idealism that I feel I must call out on. Aside from having two unsatisfied parents myself who wished I had been born a subservient girl, I've seen all too often parents punishing their children in public that I just find something off-putting to such '50s idealism in the modern world. I could understand why the father allows his daughter to run free in the backyard without supervision - a habit borne from the Japanese culture of confidence in security, I'm afraid - but the lenient parent is a banal mundanity in many children's movies that shouldn't really be highlighted as often as this film does unless it serves a more meaningful purpose, like showing how parents everywhere should love their children.\nOr perhaps I'm simply reading too much into these two amused parents who are hollow in personality specifically because they are us, the grown-ups, looking into their envy eyes at the seemingly daydreaming children, reminiscing our carefree days of frolic.\nThere's an adult fear in the movie that I should point out, a fear that's named such because only adults would understand the fear of it. When Mei goes missing in the film, the big sister, while scrambling across the countryside searching for her, crosses a bridge. My first thought was exactly the ominous notion of a drowning kid. The interesting thing is that there are quite a few moments in the film that would lead an adult astray. Aside from the examples I had described at the beginning, there's also a scene where Mei and Satsuki are waiting for her father to get home on a bus - in a lonely bus stop at night. It's pouring heavily, and the mood in the scene seems rather grim. Naturally, I thought that the dad was going to be in some kind of accident. Then of course, there's a later scene where a shoe is found in a lake, the same lake Satsuki crossed a bridge from earlier. The shoe hints at my worst fear, but of course again, the film mocks my cynicism and reveals that it's not Mei's shoe to begin with. Amusing.\nIt's such clever writing that I'm sure an adult would find plenty to love about the film; stuff that would bring you bittersweet memories, and stuff that would grant you desires for rearing a child.\nOne last thing: it is very difficult to animate fur, so such intricate details in the depiction of fur is to be praised. Totoro is fluffy and cuddly enough in this picture that would make you go out and purchase its famous plush toy.\n        "},

I've seen their merchandise everywhere and I never really got why it was such a favorite. I had only read the synopsis and it sounded bland, so I didn't pick it up. \nI decided to watch this movie, finally, when I entered the '2016 Anime Watching Challenge.' I've realized that I made a huge mistake not watching this earlier on in my childhood. When I was a kid, I used to watch Naruto, Dragon Ball Z, and there were always so much rage in those shows. It would've been refreshing for me\n          \n        back then if I had watched this movie at that time. \nThe characters felt so realistic and well done. I've noticed that a lot of people related to Satsuki and I can't say the same since I was an indoors type of girl, but I do share a trait with Satsuki's little sister, Mei. I always used to follow my sister everywhere and I'd get overly emotional when I was left out. Everytime I saw her chase after her sister, I'd just chuckle because I remember how much of a brat I was back then. Kanta and his grandmother had to be my favorite characters in this movie because they felt so real. Kanta was probably one of the first ever tsunderes in an anime, but it's pretty normal to act like that at that age. His grandmother was so sweet and kind! She reminded me of this caretaker of mine when I was young. The character were definitely the strongest point in this movie. \nThe art was a masterpiece, considering that this was made in the 80s. The depiction of nature is stunning and the Totoros' in the movie had adorable designs. It amazes me how well they drew the trees and even the corn fields! I have to give props to the creative genius who thought of making a cat a bus.\nThe music was relaxing and the opening theme was a cute little tune that might be stuck in my head for a few days. It really reflects on the music of that time. It makes me want to sway like a palm tree (yes that's a simile.)\nI guess my only problem with this movie was the story, or the lack of one. It makes sense that their wasn't really any depth into it since it's a children's movie, but I wish there could've been more of a plot rather than 'Mei has gone missing, let's find her!'\nAll in all, it's a great movie to show for all ages. Everything else makes up for the lacking plot and it shouldn't bother you too much. I definitely recommend it.\n        "},

I consider Japan's most famous anime directors overrated and the list includes Hayao Miyazaki (keeping him company are: Momoru Hosoda, Isao Takahata, and Satoshi Kon). So, you can imagine that I didn't have high expectations going in; boy was I wrong.\nTonari no Totoro needs no introduction, it is the face of studio Ghilbi, its first release alongside Hotaru no haka, and it is referenced  and spoofed in other works constantly. \nDuring the first minute of the movie, the experienced viewer identifies the familiar studio Ghibli\n          \n        animation and the newcomer is left wondering how a movie released in 1988 can still look so beautiful, while Miyazaki introduces us to our two heroines, Satsuki (10) and Mei (4), as their father drives them to their new residence, in a rural village. \nAfter a few minutes more, we are quick to realize the main characteristic of the movie: This is a story being told while looking through the eyes of a kid. If you think you have heard that one before, allow me to make a distinction; Miyazaki managed to capture the way a kid views the world, in such a way, that it doesn't feel like a story written for kids by adults, but it feels like the accidental filming of a kid's dreamy state of mind. \nI will take this point even further; I don't think this is a kid's movie. I recognize, of course, that it has all the elements a kid's movie should have, but I'll insist. I can not imagine a kid older than 6 liking this movie. Most kids will find it unexciting, opting instead for a show that triggers are pulled, or princesses are getting crowned. \nI cannot imagine myself up until my late teens liking this movie. Instead I can easily imagine myself saying the Greek equivalent of, “well, that was a waste of time” or “nothing fucking happens”. Indeed the movie seems uneventful at first glance, but there is a distinct shadow of death and loss looming throughout  the movie; Its existence maybe be lost to the younger audiences, but it appeared to me as a potent a “villain” as any. \nBut it is high time I get to what makes this movie great. After the Kusakabe family steps out of the car, having reached their new home, we, the audience, realize that we have stepped in a magical world. The interesting part is that this magical world feels familiar and I was quick to be filled with nostalgia; watching the two sisters rush to fetch a bucket of water reminded me the first (or, at least, one of the first) times that I watched running water. Those of you who discard these feelings of nostalgia, I ask you to remember the first time that you came across a small river. And then try to imagine who happy and excited you were.\nThat brings us to the main point of why Tonari no Totoro is so great; It doesn't coerce nostalgia from us with its imagery, but it reminds us how perfectly happy we were with the simplest of things: The shade of a big tree, a path to the woods, and some folklore. \nContinuing, we are introduced to the countryside and its denizens, human and magical, but most of all we experience a sense of harmony between man and nature, so seamlessly interwoven, that it puts preachy environmental-friendly works (including ones from Miyazaki) to shame.  \nThe feelings of euphoria and harmony continue, while the two sisters meet and interact with the spirit world and combat the shadow of loss with their own childlike (I mean that in a good sense) way. The ending is simple but fulfilling. \nMy new favorite anime movie. 9.0/10.  If you like this one, my second and third favorites Hotarubi no Mori e (8.5/10) and Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki (8.0/10) share some traits.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Hayao Miyazaki's name has become synonymous with Japanese animation, rightfully so. His boundless imagination has taken us to awe-inspiring fantasy worlds, brought us on epic adventures and showed us the magic of the world that can only be seen through a child's eyes. The last of those three, the magic that children can see, is epitomized in one of his earliest and most beloved works, My Neighbor Totoro (Tonari no Tororo in Japanese).\nThe story is a simple one of two sisters, Satsuki and Mei, who moved to the country side with their father to be closer to the hospital where their ill mother is staying.\n          \n        They quickly get settled into their new place residence and get acquainted with their new neighbors. As they explore their new home, they discover the wonders of the country side, notably three strange creatures, including the gigantic and beneficent Totoro. And honestly, that is all there is to the plot.\nJudging by that summery, this movie could be an hour and a half snooze-fest, but against all odds it isn't. Not much might happen, but what does happens has a simple, almost indescribable beauty to it. A lot of this comes from Miyazaki's visual mastery, his eye for nature and knack for breathing life into everything he animates. The movie captures the wide open fields, rivers, lakes, and forests of the rural country side simply but beautifully. The art work is so lush and well detailed, it is easy to get lost in; I often felt like I was there in the brush, amongst the wilderness.\nJust as impressive is the careful animation of the people and creatures, especially that the two sisters. Satsuki and Mei's expressive faces and body language are those of a real child. Satsuki is the precocious, responsible and adventurous older sister; Mei is the attached younger sister that often mimics big sis, but is happy to go on adventures of her own. Seeing them explore and interact with the world around them, one gets the genuine feeling of watching two kids playing around. The mystical creatures they encounter have an sort of mascot look to them, especially Tororo and the Cat Bus (Heck, Totoro did become Ghibli's mascot), but still move and feel like they are alive. The movie is just so exquisitely animated.\nOf course, it is Satsuki and Mei that are the heart and soul of the movie. It is their curiosity and sense of wonder that gives the already gorgeous art a magic that makes the movie truly special, and there innocence that gives power to the movie's theme of growing up. For Mei in particular every bush, trail, and even the inside of her own house holds an adventure; something new to discover. Untainted by the complications of the grown up world, Mei sees the world in a nice, simple, and generally pleasant light with a hint of hesitation without her father or older sister around. Satsuki shares Mei's sense of adventure, but being a little older, she is also learning that the world is more complicated than the innocence of childhood that she has known til now. This shows in the last third of the movie, in which Satsuki is faced with possibilities she is not ready for (which I will not get into, the plot is so simple it is easy to spoil). Suddenly, the optimistic innocence she is so familiar with disappears, replaced by worries of the worst possible outcome. It is a quite, maturely  understated revelation that childhood eventually ends. However, the movie ends with the same light-hearted optimism it began with, holding onto a piece of that childish innocence even with the knowledge kids will one day grow out of it to some degree.\nMy Neighbor Totoro is a movie of simple pleasures. It spends most of its time indulging in the beauty of nature, and the magic of a child's heart. There are glimpses of life beyond childhood and the complications that come with maturity, however, the movie never allows them to completely eclipse the joys and youthful enthusiasm of adolescence. And that is what makes it so special. Where many other stories portray growing out of childhood as hard and harsh, Totoro handles it gently but knowingly; an approach as wonderful as it is rare."},

Leaving the characters on a basic style made the movie over all very balanced.\nSound was great, they added all the right sounds in all the right places, especially in the natural scenes.\nCharacters were very enjoyable. They are almost symbols of different stages of our life. The younger sister represents our innocent and imaginative ways when we were small. The older sister shows the kind of people who are growing older and more mature but still have an inner kid inside.\n          \n        The mother is one of those hopeful people who believes in fairytales and happy endings despite downsides. The father is the stage where we are adults who can enjoy ourselves every once in a while with the help of some youngsters. There are more characters, but you can see the movie. All I can say is that each one had their own personality and no two were the same.\nThe story was almost perfect, it basically is about how a family moves to the countryside (most likely to help the sickly mother get well) and the children adjust to their new surrounding, meeting a spiritual neighbor named totoro. Other than the last quarter of the movie, there was no specific plot. But its a kids movie, and its japanese so its excused. :P\nOPINION:\nTo be honest, I did not want to see this movie and kept delaying it for a long time. It didn't seem very impressive but I'm glad I gave it a shot. It is a very uplifting movie that helps one's spirits rise and bring back old memories from childhood. It definitely fits in the group with Spirited Away  and Ponyo but it brings a new edge all the same. I highly suggest you watch it. If you don't believe me, give it 10-20 minutes and we will see who is right.\nIf you have kids, this is a very fun movie to watch it with :)\n        "},

It’s been one of my favourites since I watched it for the first time and now I guess I should tell you about my reasons.\nFirst of all, the one things that impresses me most was, like in most of Miyazaki’s animes, I could feel imagination pouring out of the movie. It was  floating so freely that my mind just relaxed and felt at ease for the first time in a long time. I felt like the movie was breaking the walls of my mind and by that\n          \n        way, it was setting ME free and this wasn’t the first time that I’ve lived this experince, it happened with a few of the books that I’ve read or movies that I’ve watched, but it happened every time when I’ve watched one of Mayazaki’s works. \nOkay, now let’s try to find the reasons of this freedom. \nThe movie is through the eyes of two little girls; one is the big sister and the other is the little sister, so it’s their imagination that we are seeing, but  you don’t really question if it’s real or not, what they are experiencing and the one point that I’ve really liked is, it is actually quite real, because the adults, which are the people that have lost their imaginations, can also see the proofs of the girls’ magical world and this made me very happy, because I want to believe that something magical is happening in the world and there should be, otherwise it would be plain world and where is the fun in that? \nOther thing that I’ve really liked was the purity and innocence of the characters. Maybe some of the people that have watched this could think, “This isn’t real, this isn’t how people are acting in the real world.” Well, genius, that’s the my main point. Ofcourse they aren’t acting like your usual jerk that lives around you or upside you or below you. This is the perfect world where forest is happy and people are innocent and good. That’s why I feel happy when I watch this. I don’t want to see everyday people when I watch an anime from Hayazaki anyway. I know they are good and I’m perfectly happy about it. \nAlso, ofcourse, another thing that makes this movie so perfect is the animation and how well it can reflect the great story to us. The movements of the characters and the views of the forest, everything is just excellent. \nBy this point, I’m sure you think that I’ve liked everything about My Neighbor Totoro. Actually, no. The one thing I didn’t like was the song at the end, it was really simple and easy to compose, but even that can’t change my overall point, which is the perfect score, because it’s main target is children and children like songs like this, therefore, even though I didn’t like that song, it’s understandable why they chose it.  I guess you were right about when you’ve thought that I like this movie and everything about it then, becuase I even adore its flaws.\nSo, if you are going to watch this anime and I think you should definitely watch it, this is a perfect Hayao Miyazaki movie; nothing more, nothing less and if you don’t feel happy after you’ve finished watching it and don’t want to movie to never end, then maybe you should arrange your “human settings” to factory defaults, because obviously you have lost something on the way here. Have fun."},

Would less be expected from Hayao Miyazaki?\nMy Neighbor Tortoro, is a classic.  Nothing needs to be argued that this is most possibly Studio Ghibli's most universally recognized film with its perfectly cuddly teddy bear of a mascot (being the Studio Ghibli logo after release), even making his way into mainstream cameos such as the likes of Toy Story 3 over 20 years later.  Needless to say, Totoro is an icon among anime just as Micky Mouse is an icon among western cartoons.\n          \n         But being an icon isn't everything, how does the actual piece behind the anime mascot actually hold up?  Is My Neighbor Tortoro overrated?\nHonestly, this movie is fascinating slow-paced.  As a child, I never realized it, but hardly anything actually happens in this film.  It lacks an antagonist or real threat to characters, and the plot can literally be boiled down to \"a family moves to a new town.\"  By the end of the film, nothing has really changed.  But at the same time, the audience leaves changed.  This movie symbolizes childhood growth.  The film's genre is technically a fantasy adventure, but much of the narrative is soaked in \"slice of life.\"  Full scenes dedicated to characters exploring common everyday places in silence, long shots of people working in the fields, and even a scene of a character doing mundane paperwork.  The film draws heavy contrast to the adult life and the simple wonders and growth that happen in childhood.  From being scared of the dark and spooked by the wind to waiting at a bus stop in the rain, this film's atmosphere is soaked with effective realistic moments of...simply put, nothing (nothing equaling daily living).  Is the titular character real or not?  Does it matter?  The vivid imaginations of the two sisters make the character real to us as they progress through the first few weeks living in their new countryside home.\nThe art is visually serene with many shots of the beautiful Japanese countryside, nature, and aesthetics of an old, dusty home.  The film sells realism to you as a viewer.  It's a Studio Ghibli film.  The arts great.  End of story.\nThe characters are simple, but effective in their presentation.  You have our leads of Satsuki and Mei Kusakabe, two wide-eyed girls moving into a new land full of adventures befitting a young sisterhood.  Mei is constantly imitating her older sister and Satsuki is trying to be maternally responsible while her mother recovers in the hospital.  Everything a five and ten-year old would do in their situation.  Nothing seems out of place.  The girls' father is tender-hearted and invested in his family's well-being and earns a gold star for father of the year easy.  You buy the authenticity and simplicity of the Kusakabe family and the supporting cast.  (Might I also add it is nice to see an intact family who loves each other for a change amidst all these shows and films where a parent is dead or not present due to past issues?  A unit where the parents are supportive and caring of each member in their family.  It's refreshing.)\nUltimately, this film is severely atmospheric with little substantial action beyond a few scenes with the titular character.  It speaks volumes in its frequent silence and visual rumination.  If that's not your cup of tea, you will probably write My Neighbor Totoro off as a boring kid's film or sluggish art piece.  However, I'd argue it is the perfect kind of children's film and very thought-provoking art piece.  Not because it says anything complex, but merely shows the simplicity and humanity of what it is to be a growing child.\n        "},

I think if I were a kid, this movie would've been a lot more enjoyable for me to watch. Not that it was bad, I just didn't find the sense of grandeur in it that I was expecting to, which is probably due to the fact that I'm nearly a 21 year old adult.\nBut it was a very sweet movie. I actually have a finger puppet of Totoro from Japan that my friend bought me,\n          \n        so obviously, I love that little (or humongous) pusheen-lookin'-fellow.\nIf nothing else, I'll probably show this film to my kids.

Maybe because this movie had a \"ancient Japan/Feudal Era\" feel. \nThe two sisters' adventure seemed like it was a lot of fun. I really wish I could go on an adventure with a supernatural being like Totoro, but I don't think it could happen unless I got transported to the anime world. \nTotoro seems like he's really fluffy. I wanna hug him. He's so cute!\nThe little Totoros are really\n          \n        cute too! They were adorable! \nI also wish I could move to the countryside like the two sisters.

Most of these attempts are not equal to the subject material, and when the topic is 'the magic of childhood', it's usually wise to brace yourself for something trite, drippy, and sentimental.\nMy Neighbor Totoro is that rare exception, a story about 'the magic of childhood' that is absolutely equal to its subject.\nThe things in the movie that are imaginary are wonderfully imagined.  But no less wonderful are the things that are clearly real--from\n          \n        the relationship between the sisters and their father to the few incidental frames of background animation that remind you what it's like to catch a glimpse of a fish in a stream.  The world of the movie and its characters are so detailed and specific, so well-observed, that you believe in them utterly; then, when the whole thing begins to steer towards 'magical realism', you believe that too.\nMy Neighbor Totoro is well past being a good anime.  It's a great movie, and an artistic accomplishment that demonstrates the potential of the medium.  If you're reading this site, odds are you're familiar with the director, Hayao Miyazaki.  Totoro was my first exposure to Miyazaki, my 'gateway drug' to the world of anime, and I remain in the debt of the person who sat me down in front of it.  If comics, or animation, or imagination are important to you, you owe it to yourself to see this movie.\n        "},

People say a person dies two times in his life, once when he is really dead and once when he steps out of his childhood. So if you are given a chance to live up your childhood for some 90 minutes, this movie is for you. Mystical creatures, nature, joy and sadness conquered by happiness are the some childhood reasoning. You wont go on reason everything you see and you have a belief in everything even Santa Claus when you are a kid so\n          \n        why don't relive those great feelings.\nSpeaking for the movie the movie is made with a big heart. The picturesque scenery, the great artwork, the epic storyline, even the soundtrack especially THE PATH OF WIND one of my fav's instrumental. Hayao Miyazaki has created a life out of the movie. Besides it will indulge you in your childhood nostalgia, it will also show how beautiful nature and the villages can be which are reducing at a great rate.\nMany say this is a movie for kids, some say it's so naive. It is if you watch this movie with your mind full of reasoning. Sometimes do follow your heart and then watch this movie and feel the workmanship the makers have put into it.\nConcluding movies like this are not made often.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    My Neighbor Totoro is another fantastic film by Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. Ghibli is like the Pixar of anime, these guys have a ton of talent and imagination to work with that anything they can make out of it will come out as something new and exciting every year, Yes, Tales Of Earthsea was a disappointment from Studio Ghibli, but so what? They had a lot of good films that they made, that it doesn't matter if they made ONE bad film. But I'm here to review Totoro and so, let's get started.\nWhat I like about Totoro is how it handles the theme of\n          \n        childhood imagination in the film. Satsuki and Mei represents us on how we used to be as kids, as we like to explore new houses, spend time with each other, always sticking together and have an incredible amount of imagination and wonder into our own minds when they spent time with the spirit Totoro. Totoro also plays a big role into this whole childhood theme I'm talking about here. He represents miracles on our main characters and represents a child's imagination coming to life, doing all sorts of magical things, like having a cat who can turn into a bus. It also sees the girls dealing with experience, situations and explorations rather than a conflict or threat, which is a nice change to the story. It also has great supporting characters like the grandmother who takes care of the girls, the father who spends time with the girls and so on.\nThe animation is beautiful and astounding to look at. While it was made in 1988, you can see that Ghibli put a lot of effort in the animation as they always do with their films and it still holds up pretty well. The backgrounds of the countryside of Japan are amazing to look at, with so much sharp detail added in the background art and the character models and expressions are very well animated and very fluid. The music by Joe Hisaishi is fantastic, giving a very happy mood to the film, adding some fantastical orchestral music to help keep the story move forward and giving a lot of emotions to the viewer to sink their hearts. The dub by Disney is excellent and I have to give props to Dakota Fanning and Elle Fanning for their performances as Satsuki and Mei, cause their performances really give a lifelike feel to the characters, as if they were actual little girls in the film and they pulled it off perfectly. Frank Welker, the man of many great voices, does a great job as Totoro and the Catbus, I just love his epic roar and by God, he was awesome in the film and he was a lot of fun to listen to.\nMy Neighbor Totoro is another masterpiece by Hayao Miyazaki and this film gives more reasons why all of Miyazaki's films are so damn awesome to see. Miyazaki puts his heart and soul into this projects that he creates, takes inspirations based on his life and with it, creates a wonderful adventure that takes us beyond the same typical fantasy route that we all seen before and that's where Totoro comes in. If you love Miyazaki like I do, then I highly recommend you see this little work of art for all fans of anime and Miyazaki.\n        "},

I was however left slightly disappointed. Now i'm not saying that the film was bad i'm just saying in comparison to other Studio Ghibli films it isn't that great. \nThe story was ok, it wasn't as engaging as say Princess Mononoke but it was still enjoyable.\nThe artwork for this film as it is for all Ghibli films is outstanding. The attention to detail and the way it flows is pleasing to the eye. \nThe sound is good in both the english dub and subbed versions. \nThe characters\n          \n        are enjoyable to look at and fit well into the film. \nOverall I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to people who are getting into anime. \nHope this helped :)\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Story: The scope of My Neighbor Totoro is very small. The film details the adventures of a couple of normal children, with relatively little conflict. Everything is on a very personal scale; rather than go on an over the top adventure, a large portion of the film is about the main characters having fantastical experiences with the titular... mammal (let's go with that) Totoro. \n7/10\nVisuals: Totoro features the typical Miyazaki art style. The animation looks stunning, and has aged very nicely, especially considering when this came out. Totoro was created in the 80s, and it looks nicer than anime from the late 90s-early 2000s.\n10/10 \nAudio:\n          \n        The sound was also nice given the time period\n8/10\nCharacters: The characters aren't anything extraordinary, but they're defiantly portrayed in a way that makes them seem like real people. \n7.5/10\n\nOverall, My Neighbor Totoro is a good, classic, family movie, though it's very small in scope and in my opinion, lacks sufficient conflict\n        "},

Some people find friends/family to talk to. Others try to drink their problems away. However, in \"My Neighbour Totoro\", Satsuki and Mei use their imagination to help them cope with situations. To them, Totoro is their guardian angel that helps guide them to a better state from moving to Mei going missing. He is a sign of hope and love.\nInitially, it is hard moving from one area to the next. Leaving friends and family behind, and losing that place of home. Satsuki and Mei were placed in a new town to\n          \n        start all over again. For Satsuki, it is easier for her to deal with since she is able to make friends at school and will not be so lonely all the time. As for Mei, she is stuck at home with nothing to do. Since her father is busy with work, she is forced to play with herself. But when Mei sees the mini Totoros, she is  filled with excitement. To her, she finds a friend she can play with so she will not feel lonely. Totoro, in a way, helps Mei feel happier about moving by finding a friend to be with when she does not have her sister or father to talk to.\nMoreover, Totoro helps guide Satsuki in the cat bus to find Mei. When Satsuki feels down about losing her sister and not being able to find her, Totoro comes to her aid to help find Mei. None of the adults are able to find Mei no matter how hard they look. Satsuki starts to lose hope getting worried about what could happen to her little sister if they did not find her soon. When she is about to break into tears, Totoro comes to help her. He seems to understand what is happening and as fast as he can, he finds Mei. Totoro guards Satsuki and Mei making sure that both of them are safe from troubles and worries.\nIn conclusion, \"My Neighbour Totoro\" is a movie that shows that no matter what situation a person may be in, there is always this gleaming presence of hope to be found. Totoro is a hopeful angel that helps Mei get used to the new move and find Mei when she goes missing. \"My Neighbour Totoro\" is an adorable, loving, and funny movie where kids, and adults, will learn lessons of hope and the greatness of imagination.\n"},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    I recently had a conversation wherein i was asked how to get someone into anime. My answer was to get them past the idea of cartoons as a shameful thing and as such start with western cartoons they are familiar with. Today I realized that there was a better way. Any studio Ghibli film is both amazing and socially acceptable. To the unkeen eye they could be passed off as Disney movies. What makes them perfect for introducing people to anime is how they dont introduce allot of the weirdness that is Japanese culture. They have no fanservice, otaku culture, Moe characters etc. What you\n          \n        get is a pure story that is universally understood.\nPeople often forget Ghibli films in discussion of the best anime. It may be because they are to westernized or because they are movies and not series, but nonetheless I rarely hear people bring them up in such debates. When they do they are often citations of Howls moving castle, Princess Mononoke, and even Spirited Away. My Neighbor Totoro isn't often on that list. Totoro falls into a different place in your heart. Rather than be citizen cane, Totoro is the ultimate childhood movie.\nWhen I re-watch Totoro I think of how I will watch this with my kids one day. Totoro is likely the happiest damn thing ever made. When I first watched Wall-E I though about how well the lack of speech works in that movie, However it pales in comparison to how giddy Totoro's smile made me. From the Catbus to the scene in the rain, Totoro is filled with moments that bring wonder to the eyes of children and sheer joy to adults like me. If Totoro doesn't move you then you have something wrong that many years if psychiatry may not fix.\nHowever it is not perfect. I can summarize Totoro in three sentences. There is so little that actually happens in this movie. Looking back it can feel like a bunch of set pieces that where strung together. Before I re-watched it I forgot the order in which things happen. That perhaps is Totoro's biggest flaw. You won't remember the journey the kids took so much that you'll remember all the times you almost cried from cuteness. \nWatch only if you have a soul. Otherwise you'll waste your time.\n-Docbrown - Otakucenter.com - Reveiw Squad\n        "},
