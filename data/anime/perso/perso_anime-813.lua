He is considered both the son and reincarnation of Demon King Piccolo and was spawned to save himself from certain death at the hands of Son Goku. Like his father, he appears as a tall green humanoid creature with pointy ears; he is later revealed to be part of an alien race known as the Namekians. \n \n Piccolo is first consumed with revenge against Goku, and elects to defeat and kill him during the 23rd Budokai Tenkaichi. After his narrow defeat against Goku, Piccolo is soon forced to form an at first uneasy alliance with Goku and his friends against newer, more dangerous threats like the Saiyans and Freeza. Out of necessity he also takes it upon himself to train Goku\'s child Son Gohan, forming a bond which is strengthened when he sacrifices himself to save the child\'s life against Nappa. After his resurrection, he fully joins Goku and the others in their struggles against ever more powerful villains.\n \n Piccolo still retains elements of ruthlessness and cockiness, but once he fuses with Kami, all traces of evil and hate disappear, and Piccolo is completely reborn as a pure soul. Piccolo remains a loner, preferring to stand apart from others. He has little to say unless it involves battle, but he normally can still retain his stoic and calm personality in everyday, normal situations. Piccolo has shown to have intelligence, such as when he gathered strength to regenerate his arm after Cell had drained it, or when he elected to kill Babidi since he knew leaving him alive wouldn\'t solve the problem of Buu. His intelligence is even picked up on Buu, who later absorbs him for his fine brain.\n \n Piccolo\'s character development entails him changing from a villain hell-bent on revenge on Goku and controlling the world to becoming a better person who is capable of caring about other people, like Gohan and Goku. He\'s also showed some interest in learning about his Namekian heritage, and has a good affinity with kids, as he trained Gohan for a year, helped Goten and Trunks to learn Fusion\n and is even seen humorously rocking Pan to sleep in <i>Fukkatsu no F</i>. He also acts as a confidant for Dende, who is a younger Namekian and is tasked with watching over Earth (Piccolo is able to impart the wisdom he gained from fusing with Kami, as Kami was the previous placeholder of Dende\'s current occupation).\n \n (Source: Dragon Ball Super Exciting Guide, Character Edition)\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 246,   ["firstname"] = "Son", ["lastname"] = "Gokuu",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Gokuu \"Kakarot\" Son", }, ["description"] = "Race: Saiyan Height: 5\'9\" (175,3 cm)\n Weight: 145 lbs (65,8 kg)\n Birth year: 737 Age\n Hobby: Fighting strong opponents\n Favorite food: Everything\n Favorite vehicle: Kintoun (Nimbus)\n \n Originally named Kakarot, Gokuu is born a member of a race of extraterrestrials called the Saiyans. Shortly following his birth, Gokuu is sent from his native planet Vegeta to Earth, for potential selling on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life; Goku was also sent away to escape Freeza\'s genocide of the Saiyans. Once he lands on Earth, he is adopted by an old man named Gohan (who is later just called Grandpa Gohan). At first, Goku is very violent as a kid due to his Saiyan blood, but due to an injury to his head that caused him severe amnesia, Gokuu changes to a more tempered, innocent boy. At the start of the series, Gokuu meets Bulma, Yamucha, Oolong, and Pu\'ar, whose characters mirror those found in Wu Cheng\'en\'s Journey to the West. He also encounters Kuririn, who eventually becomes his best friend, and others during his journey for more strength. Participating in several World Martial Arts Tournaments, Gokuu also battles foes-turned-allies such as Tenshinhan and Chaozu, as well as the offspring of Demon King Piccolo named Majunior (later, he\'s named just Piccolo).\n \n Dragon Ball Z takes place 5 years after Gokuu\'s victory against Piccolo in the 23rd Budokai Tenkaichi. He now has a son named Son Gohan (named after Grandpa Gohan) who lacks his father\'s love of fighting but has a great hidden potential himself. Throughout the series, Gokuu & Gohan face terribly strong opponents like other powerful Saiyans, a space tyrant, artificial humans, Majins & Gods that threaten Earth while also giving them exhilarating fights. Along with new enemies, they also gain new friends that help in these situations. As well as becoming more powerful, Gokuu learns to accept his forgotten Saiyan heritage (this gives him a small identity crisis when Raditz reveals his past, and is something he carries with him into the proceeding Namek arc) & consistently comes across the predicament of killing an opponent (he starts out killing without much thought to the moral consequences of taking a life, and only after training under Kami does he start to struggle with killing a person; this comes to a head when he fights Freeza on Namek).\n \n In <i>Dragon Ball GT</i>, which is not based on Toriyama\'s manga, Gokuu is turned into a child by Pilaf via the Black-Star Dragon Balls. The series revolves around him traveling around space to find the Black Star Dragon Balls with the help of his granddaughter Pan and Trunks. After collecting the spheres, Gokuu does battle with Baby (a Tuffle who wants revenge on all Saiyans for killing his race), Super 17 (a powered-up version of former enemy Artificial Human 17) and various Evil Dragons (the physical constructs of negative energy accumulated in the Dragon Balls; they are called Shadow Dragons in FUNimation\'s dub). The series ends with Gokuu leaving for good with Shenron and returning 100 years later to witness the match between Gokuu Jr. and Vegeta Jr.\n \n In <i>Dragon Ball Online</i> (which takes place 216 years after <i>Dragon Ball Z</i>, in which Toriyama had a lot of creative control over the story, unlike <i>Dragon Ball GT</i>), a new villain by the name of Miira appears with the goal to obtain Gokuu\'s DNA.\n \n In <i>Cross Epoch</i>, the <i>Dragon Ball</i> and <i>One Piece</i> crossover one-shot, Gokuu is seen accompanying Luffy to attend a party hosted by Shenron from whom key characters from both series had received an invitation.\n \n In <i>Dragon Ball Minus</i>, it is revealed that Gokuu was sent away by his mother and father (Gine & Bardock) to escape Freeza\'s genocide of the Saiyans. Gokuu leaves Planet Vegeta in his pod with a forlorn look as his parents send him away.\n \n Gokuu is known for his laid-back personality and his love of fighting worthy opponents. He will eat anything without much qualms. He has an uncanny ability to make allies out of foes he has fought (in some cases to the death), though his capacity for sparing his enemies has occasionally been criticized as foolish (Gokuu generally only fights to win and improve himself, and spares his enemies after winning only for them to attack him when his back is turned). Gokuu can also be very blunt, and not afraid to express his opinion in a discussion, such as when he questioned Krillin\'s marriage to Android 18 (who was not fully human and a previous enemy who threatened his life). Despite his kind-hearted nature, Gokuu can feel incredible anger in cases of extreme turmoil, such as the death of a close friend/relative, or when someone murders many innocents needlessly. He has a simple, practical view of the world and is somewhat naive to the world around him. Because of this, many characters incorrectly assume him to be somewhat stupid, although once he has a basic understanding of things, he learns very quickly. His most remarkable ability is his will to succeed, his tenacity and persistence.\n \n He\'s so focused on improving himself as a warrior that some of the decisions he makes are detrimental to the survival of humanity or those who he cares about. Such examples include when he purposefully chose not to help his friends and family when they were attacked by Beerus at Bulma\'s birthday so as to study his opponent, or when he elected not to destroy Gero\'s lab in favor of his curiosity at his potential opponents\' strength even though it might\'ve meant the destruction of mankind. This is also touched upon when he spares Vegeta for a rematch in the Saiyan arc, despite this also being a threat to humanity. However, he has shown to be able to slightly curb this selfishness, as he elected to not return to life after dying in the fight against Cell so that Earth would not be endangered by the evil people he tends to attract (although, Goku is also interested in fighting the masters in the afterlife indicating some slight selfishness was still apparent). \n \n Goku has also admitted to not being good at creating things, and being better at breaking stuff at the end of <i>Dragon Ball Kai</i>. In <i>Dragon Ball Super</i> Ep. 4, Goku is revealed not to be much of a party-goer. He has also shown an affinity with training younger kids (like how he did with Gohan in the Androids arc, Goten & Trunks in the Buu arc, and Uub at the end of the series).\n \n (Source: Dragon Ball Super Exciting Character Guide)\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 2093,   ["firstname"] = "Son", ["lastname"] = "Gohan",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Gohan \"The Great Saiyaman", " The Gold Fighter", " The Golden Warrior\" Son", }, ["description"] = "Race: Half Saiyan, Half-Human Height: 5\' 9\'\n Weight: 155 lbs\n Birth year: 757 Age\n Hobbies: reading, fishing, researching\n Favorite foods: all types of food\n Favorite vehicle: House Wagon\n \n Gohan is a main character in the <i>Dragon Ball</i> series by Akira Toriyama and is the dual main character of <i>Dragon Ball Z</i> along with his father, Goku.\n \n Gohan is a shy and studious intellectual, and as a child lacks the fighting spirit that is common among most Saiyans. However, because he is forced to protect the ones he loves, he taps into his vast half-breed Saiyan potential, becoming one of the most powerful main characters in the series. As an adult, he abandons his superhero duties and uses his mind, as a premier scholar. Gohan is extremely powerful, sometimes surpassing Gokuu, Piccolo and Vegeta at certain points in the story.\n \n At first, the relationship with Piccolo is a frightening one, but after Piccolo saves Gohan\'s life from Nappa at the cost of his own, Piccolo admits his change because of Gohan\'s acceptance of him during the 1 year they were training together. From here on out, Piccolo acts as an uncle (oji-san in the Japanese version) to Gohan. Krillin also acted as a strong confidant in Gohan, particularly during the Namek arc and the beginning of the Buu arc.\n \n Gohan also shares a strong relationship with his father in Gokuu, citing his walking up to Freeza on Namek as a source of inspiration and strength. He also spends to close to a full year just with him in the Room of Spirit and Time during the Androids arc, and the two really get to enjoy each other\'s company. Gohan\'s respect and love for his father is all the more shown when he elects to wear Goku\'s orange gi when he sets off to fight Buu.\n \n His hobbies are reading, fishing, and researching scholarly subjects. Though he claims he does not share the love of fighting Gokuu has, Gohan does feel obligated to help when danger arrives. He also enjoys being a hero, as seen by his comedic and unimpressive Great Saiyaman stunt.

However, as the story unfolds, he changes to a person capable of caring about and loving someone other than himself.\n \n Vegeta was once a young member of the Saiyan army, but after his race\'s demise, he worked alongside Nappa and Raditz, directly under Freeza.

However, this is later contradicted by the Dragon Ball GT Perfect file books that stated that she could have ascended if she trained hard enough. It was also stated by Toriyama that the simple reason to Pan\'s inability to become a Super Saiyajin was that he could not come up with a logical design for a female Super Saiyajin; being that most of the Super Saiyajin traits are typical of males, and not females.\n \n As Pan only appears for three chapters in the manga, her later life is elaborated on in the anime-only series called Dragon Ball GT, where she is seen as a young girl who travels the galaxy with her grandfather Goku, and Trunks, the half-Saiyajin son of the characters Vegeta and Bulma. In the final episode of Dragon Ball GT, Pan is seen as an old woman, being over 100 years old. She is the grandmother to the character named Son Goku Jr., who has the ability to become a Super Saiyajin.
