Tragedy and sadness will never truly disappear.\"</i>\n \n Homura is a magical girl who first appears in an apocalyptic nightmare of Madoka\'s. She transfers into her school the day after the dream. She is a beautiful, mysterious individual that performs exceptionally well in academics and athletics. This makes her instantly popular even though she is cold to others.\n \n She seems to know Madoka well and wishes to prevent her from becoming a magical girl. She attacks Kyubey in the first episode, only to be stopped by Mami.\n \n Homura\'s cold personality developed from repeating the same timeline again and again. She was originally a shy, weak transfer student who spent a long time in hospital due to a heart disease. She was befriended and eventually saved from a witch by Madoka, who revealed that she was a magical girl. When Madoka was killed in her battle with WalpurgisNacht, Homura contracted with Kyubey to become a person that could protect her. She became a magical girl with the ability to manipulate time, allowing her to return to her first meeting with Madoka in order to change her fate. She tries again and again to prevent Madoka from being killed or becoming a magical girl and, inevitably, a witch, but is never able to save her. She always returns to the beginning of the month upon failure.\n \n Her magical weapon is a shield filled with sand that allows her to freeze time. However, this power becomes useless if she is physically restrained as she cannot turn her shield to activate it. She can also use this shield to block projectiles and store the various weapons she carries. Since her shield and magic have no offensive capability, she instead attacks using stolen firearms and homemade explosives while time is stopped. Once the sand on her shield runs out, Homura must reset the timeline.\n REBELLION SPOILER\n In rebellion, Homura extracts Madoka\'s human form from Law of Cycles and then rewrites the world. She calls herself \"Devil,\" though her power comes not from grief but from love. She creates a new timeline where Madoka transfers to Homura\'s school and Sayaka and Momoe Nagisa are alive.\n \n She is nicknamed \"Akuma (Devil) Homura\" by fans.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 37832,   ["firstname"] = "Kaname", ["lastname"] = "Madoka",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Madoka  Kaname", }, ["description"] = "Age: 14 Birthdate: October 3\n Zodiac: Libra\n Height: 152 cm\n Blood type: A\n Shoe size: US Women\'s 5.5\n \n A 14-year-old girl whose life changes when she encounters the Puella Magi Homura and the familiar Kyubey, who offers to transform her into a Puella Magi herself. She sees herself as a person without special qualities or talents, and after seeing Mami fighting against witches, wants to be a wonderful and cool Puella Magi like her.  She is a rather selfless girl who wishes to be a magical girl simply so that she can help others. She allegedly has a large amount of magical potential within her. \n \n Following Mami\'s death, she becomes uncertain about becoming a Puella Magi, becoming more so as the dark secrets of the Puella Magi are revealed to her. She is kind, gentle, averse to fighting, and wishes that everyone would get along, sometimes even putting her own life at risk to help others. In previous timelines that Homura had experienced, Madoka had become a Puella Magi, wielding a magic bow and arrow. According to Kyubey, she is capable of becoming the strongest Puella Magi and the most terrible witch, capable of destroying the world, which is why he is most interested in forming a contract with her.\n At the beginning of the 3rd movie she is trapped inside Homura\'s tainted soul gem, in false Mitakihara. Her memories are gone and she is fighting \"Nightmares\" with the other 4 girls. During the finale, she regains her memories and godlike powers, but they are partially stolen by Akemi Homura to rewrite the world where Madoka can live as a human while Law of Cycles is still working. Her (and other magical girls\') memories are rewritten by Homura, and in that world Madoka is the transfer student, who is greeted and guided by Homura.\n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 38566,   ["firstname"] = "Kyuubey", ["lastname"] = "Kyuubey",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Kyuubey \"Incubator", " QB\"", }, ["description"] = "His name is written in both Hiragana and Katakana as \xe3\x82\xad\xe3\x83\xa5(kyu)\xe3\x82\xa5(u)\xe3\x81\xb9(be)\xe3\x81\x88(e). So the more acceptable Romaji for his name is Kyuubee/Kyuubey.  \n He is a familiar who can grant any wish to a certain girl, on the condition that she becomes a Puella Magi and fights against witches.\n \n When someone makes a contract with him, he extracts their soul and places it inside a Soul Gem, replacing their body with a shell that\'s more resilient to fighting witches.\n \n He has made contracts with Mami, Kyoko, Homura, and Sayaka, and shows particular interest in making Madoka a Puella Magi. \n \n It is unknown if there are other familiars besides him. He can only be seen or heard by Puella Magi and those who have potential to become a Puella Magi. He also disposes of used Grief Seeds for the Puella Magi, because, if they are used too extensively, the witch could become reborn from the Grief Seed. He also constantly tries to find chances to persuade girls who have potential to become Puella Magi to form a contract with him, despite the fact that he knows the dangers that Puella Magi face. Much to his dismay, he cannot force a girl to become a Puella Magi.\n \n He doesn\'t fully understand human values and questions any perceived differences between himself and humans. For example, when Madoka claims that he is cruel for forming contracts with girls and turning them into Puella Magi, he compares his actions to the act of humans slaughtering livestock, saying that, unlike humans, who show a lack of interest and sympathy for other creatures\' values when it comes to their own survival, he at least recognizes humans as being sentient beings and tries to negotiate with them. Therefore, Kyuubey is neither evil nor good, just a survivor like everyone else.\n \n <b>Major Spoiler:</b> Kyuubey is an \"Incubator\" and from an advanced alien species whose civilization is located far away from Earth. A long time ago, his species took alarm to the gradual heat death of the universe, and, in their search for a solution to it, encountered a species on Earth, humans, who exhibited emotions, something Kyuubey\'s species does not have. They then subsequently discovered a type of energy called emotional energy that could be used efficiently counter entropy, and also realized that teenage human females, who are very emotionally unstable during their mental and physical development throughout puberty, harbor the most emotional energy of all humans.\n \n Therefore, it is Kyuubey\'s duty to form contracts with teenage girls and to collect the emotional energy that is created when the girl becomes a Puella Magi. However, it is also his duty to collect the massive amount of emotional energy that is created when a Puella Magi transforms into a witch, and to consume Grief Seeds, which also contain large amounts of emotional energy.\n \n It seems that negative emotions such as hatred and despair yield more emotional energy than positive emotions, since Kyuubey comments that the amount of emotional energy created when a girl becomes a Puella Magi is nothing compared to the explosion of emotional energy created when a Puella Magi transforms into a witch. Thus, it could be said that Kyuubey\'s main purpose is to \"incubate\" girls\' souls in Soul Gems until they become filled with so much negative emotion that they transform into Grief Seeds and \"hatch\" into witches, and to then \"harvest\" the emotional energy created from the transformation.\n \n Also, whenever Kyuubey is killed, he is instantly reincarnated (for lack of a better word) into a new body with the same appearance and disposes of his previous body by eating it. He seems to have an endless supply of spare bodies, so, it might not be possible to kill him in a conventional fashion.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 38395,   ["firstname"] = "Miki", ["lastname"] = "Sayaka",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Sayaka  Miki", }, ["description"] = "Age: 14 Birthdate: September 20\n Zodiac: Virgo\n Species: Human, Magical girl\n Witch (later in the anime)\n Madoka\'s classmate who, after helping Madoka rescue Kyubey, ends up getting an offer to become a Puella Magi herself. She cares deeply for her friends, and wants to help an ill boy named Kyousuke Kamijou, whom she has a crush on. Before becoming a Puella Magi, Sayaka wields a baseball bat that Mami can enhance with magic to defend herself with while on witch hunts. \n \n In order to cure Kyosuke\'s hand, which was damaged in an accident which robbed him of his ability to play the violin, she becomes a Puella Magi. Sayaka\'s weapon of choice is a sword. She also has regenerative powers stronger than anyone else due to the nature of her wish. Sayaka hates people who think only of themselves whilst hurting others and is easily provoked into a fight. \n \n After learning how Puella Magi are created, Sayaka starts to descend into despair, as she believes she\'s now no better than a zombie and thus cannot openly admit her love for Kyousuke. Her state of mind only worsens as one of her two best friends, Hitomi, confesses that she has feelings for Kyousuke too and makes advances on him. At the same time, she also refuses to purify her Soul Gem with Grief Seeds and neglects it to become tainted. At the end of episode 8, her Soul Gem was finally exhausted, and Sayaka turns into the witch Oktavia von Seckendorff. She dies in a battle with Sakura Kyouko, who sacrifices herself in order to not let Sayaka die alone. \n \n In episode 10, it\'s revealed that during Akemi Homura\'s third time loop, Sayaka also suffered the same fate of turning into a witch, and was killed by Homura with an explosive.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 40006,   ["firstname"] = "Sakura", ["lastname"] = "Kyouko",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Kyouko  Sakura", }, ["description"] = "Birthday: May 9 \n Kyouko is a veteran magical girl who comes to the city later in the story. A girl with red-colored long hair and an equally fiery personality to match. Amusingly, she is always seen eating something, even while she is battling.  \n \n She came from a poor church family and used her wish so that people would listen to her father\'s preaching; when her father learned of this, however, he went mad and killed everyone in his family aside from Kyouko. As such, Kyouko decided only to use her magic for herself from this point on, since using it for others will only cause despair.\n Having grown up in a poor family, she often has to steal food and hates people who waste it, a logic she also applies to Grief Seeds, as she only goes after fully grown witches.\n \n Kyouko has been a Puella Magi much longer than the others, and thus is more skillful; she wields a spear which can extend itself, split into multiple sections, and produce a ball at the end of a chain, which can constrict and hit others at the same time. She also has the ability to put up barriers to protect others or keep them from interfering. \n She initially clashes with Sayaka, but after learning the truth about Soul Gems, she sympathizes with her and tries to help her. \n \n After Sayaka becomes a witch, she becomes determined to save her and restore her to normal, but ultimately sacrifices herself in the fight so that Sayaka would not die alone. She overloads her soul gem to create a massive explosion that kills them both. \n \n In a previous timeline, she was killed by Mami, who was driven insane after learning that they would all eventually become witches. \n \n In the final timeline, Kyouko survives, and grieves over Sayaka\'s death in battle. \n \n In the third drama CD, it is explained that, prior to the main storyline, Kyouko once had the power to utilize illusion magic, but after her family\'s death she subconsciously lost that ability. She also had a friendship with Mami prior to her family\'s death, which was severed when Kyouko decided to be more selfish with her magic. This friendship was also explored in Oriko Magica, though not in-depth.\n Her relationship with Mami is thoroughly explained in The Different Story, showing in depth the events mentioned in the drama CD and it is also shown that her previous mentor-apprentice relationship with Mami is the reason of her coming to Mitagawa City. This occurs before Homura\'s checkpoint, so it\'s supposedly a constant and remains true as her motives for retuning to the city in the anime as well.\n \n At some point in The Different Story manga Kyouko also comes in terms with her past and regains a fraction of her illusion magic, which she uses to fool Mami into believing she had cleansed her Soul Gem and allows her to live. After defeating Oktavia and truly cleansing Mami\'s Soul Gem, Kyouko dies in her fight with another witch while trying to get a Grief Seed for herself.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 38194,   ["firstname"] = "Tomoe", ["lastname"] = "Mami",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Mami  Tomoe", }, ["description"] = "Birthday: June 5 \n Mami is a veteran magical girl and a third-year student at Madoka\'s school.

In a previous timeline, learning of these truths drove Mami insane and she attempted to murder the remaining magical girls to prevent them from becoming witches, and in the Oriko Magica timeline, she contemplates letting herself be killed and/or committing suicide so she doesn\'t become a witch herself.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 40842,   ["firstname"] = "Charlotte", ["lastname"] = "Charlotte",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Charlotte \"BB\"", }, ["description"] = "The witch of desserts.
