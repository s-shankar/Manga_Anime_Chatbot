He is a merciful soul by nature, and a firm believer in solving problems without causing bloodshed. This creates a sharp contrast between himself and the rest of the Saints: Whereas they will not hesitate to battle when the situation demands it, Shun only allows himself to fight if it\'s an absolute necessity, or when his almost endless patience wears off. When any of these things happen, Shun becomes an extremely vicious fighter. \n \n Shun comes off rather badly in the Movies and \"Asgard\" arc. In almost every fight scene, he almost always loses, and needs his brother Ikki to rescue him (except against Mizar Zeta Syd, the one time Shun defeated a foe in either the Movies or \'Asgard\' story). \n \n However, in the \"Sanctuary,\" \"Poseidon.\" and \"Hades\" storylines, Shun comes off as a good, if reluctant fighter. In \'Sanctuary\', he manages to hold his own against Gemini Saga, and even manages to kill Pisces Aphrodite, both of them Gold Saints. In \'Poseidon\', he acquits himself nicely, defeating Io, the Southern Pacific Mariner General of Scylla, and Sorrento, the Southern Atlantic Mariner General of Siren. In \'Hades\', he manages to dispatch various opponents. As a result, he comes off looking much better in these arcs than in the Movies or \'Asgard\'; though he may be reluctant to fight, he will when he has to, and is just as powerful or skilled as any of the other main Bronze Saints (Shiryu, Hyoga, etc.) \n \n (Source: Wikipedia) \n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 5921,   ["firstname"] = "Cygnus", ["lastname"] = "Hyouga",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Hyouga  Cygnus", }, ["description"] = "Birthday: 23 January \n One of the truly interesting main characters in the series, Hyoga appears calm, collected, and unemotional. Beneath the surface, however, he is passionate and devoted to his ideals. \n \n The one person that forever lives in Hyoga mind is his deceased mother. She died when Hyoga was still very young, having drowned during the shipwreck of a doomed cruise. The ship sunk into the icy ocean, where the extreme cold kept Hyoga\'s mother from rigor mortis. Throughout the Sanctuary arc, Hyoga is shown to visit his mother periodically by diving into the waters. \n \n As a saint born under the Cygnus constellation, Hyoga is able to control and manipulate ice and snow however he pleases. It is also implied that he is the first to wear the Cygnus Cloth in 10,000 years, as the cloth was previously concealed within an iceberg before Hyoga retrieved it. \n \n The Cygnus Saint\'s favorite technique is Diamond Dust (\xe3\x83\x80\xe3\x82\xa4\xe3\x83\xa4\xe3\x83\xa2\xe3\x83\xb3\xe3\x83\x89\xe3\x83\x80\xe3\x82\xb9\xe3\x83\x88, daiyamondo dasuto?), a windy attack that blasts ice and snow at the opponent in a single, concentrated point.

In Kurumada\'s mythos, she is sent to Earth by the Olympian gods every 250 years, when evil takes over Earth.

She hates weapons, and thus only allows her Saints to battle using their bodies and armors. The only Saint allowed by her to wield weapons is the Libra Gold Saint, and it is only with her permission that the Saints are allowed to brandish the weapons kept by the Libra Saint.\n \n She has opposed the ambitions of antagonist deities since the ages of myth in Greece, earning herself the rejection of the other Olympian gods.

He could easily be recognized as the strongest bronze saint when it comes to raw power.  \n Ikki\'s personality is drastically different than his fellow bronze saints. He is very unlike his younger brother - who is almost the opposite of him: Shun is calm, soft, caring and very emotional, whereas Ikki is harsh, cold, aggressive, and very much of a loner. Fellow bronze saint Wolf Nachi once pointed out that it was very hard to believe Ikki and Shun were related due to the extreme difference in their personalities. \n \n As noted by Kanon in the Poseidon arc and by Pandora in the Hades chapter, Ikki\'s cosmos is unique to him -- it is a cosmos full of hate, anger, and incredible aggression and power, but guided by his love for his younger brother, his friends and Athena. Although he dislikes working in groups, he comes to battle whenever Athena\'s saints need his help, and is often seen coming in the nick of time to save his younger brother from certain death.This tactic has always been exploited to their advantage, since the enemies are caught by surprise upon meeting/fighting him.

Due to this, his power consists not in destroying the matter, but in freezing it. Among those warriors who use this kind of ability, Camus is considered the stronger since he is the one who can lower more the movements, creating a lower temperature.

While all gold saints have a base of psychic powers to some degree, Mu has been stated to possess the strongest raw psychic talent among all living gold saints. This allows him to manipulate his gift to various degrees: psychokinesis, telepathy, teleportation, and various other powers are at his command.\n \n Mu is very soft spoken, with a scholarly-like personality; his demeanor is very tranquil and logical, almost as if he is a professor of the Sanctuary. Various official translations of the manga and anime, as well as Mandarin language Saint Seiya fans, tend to refer to the character as \'Lord Mu\' or \'Mister Mu\'. He is good friends with Taurus Aldebaran, and is very respectful to the 243 yr old master Libra Dohko.\n \n Before the start of the series, Mu removed himself from Sanctuary after suspecting that his mentor (and then-Pope), Aries Shion, had been quietly assassinated. He relocated to Jamir, a mystical land that only those with a high level of either psychic or Cosmo power can enter. From here, Mu severed all ties to Sanctuary and lived a life of solitude with his apprentice, the young psychic Kiki. It wasn\'t until years later, when he met Dragon Shiryu and Pegasus Seiya, that he began to become involved in the affairs of Sanctuary again.\n \n Throughout the manga and anime series, Mu is the man to go to when a Saint needs his or her cloth repaired. Although every individual Cloth has the ability to regenerate itself after a battle, a hands-on restoration from Mu is needed if a cloth has been severely damaged to the point of death. In normal cases, 1/3 of a person\'s total blood supply is required for Mu to begin work right away. When restoring an armor, Mu uses hardware tools and the elements that are used to forge a Cloth: the mythical and extremely rare metal known as Gammanium, used in an alloy with the legendary metal Orichalcum, and finally, the radiant Star Dust Sand.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 12555,   ["firstname"] = "Aries", ["lastname"] = "Shion",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Shion  Aries", }, ["description"] = "Shion is the original Grand Pope of Sanctuary, as well as one of the remaining survivors of the Holy War from the 1800s.

Also, Kanon is notable for redeeming himself after all his sins in the past and wreaking havoc as the new Gemini Gold Saint against the army of the 108 Specters in the battle against Hades.\n Kanon is the younger twin brother of gold saint Gemini Saga, and later took up his position as a Gold Saint after Saga\'s death. Before finally embracing his destiny as the Gemini Saint, Kanon masqueraded as the Sea Dragon General, one of Poseidon\'s seven Sea Generals.\n \n At first, Kanon was depicted as a treacherous man, always tempting his twin brother to use his status and power to advance his status of influence beyond that of a Gold Saint. He concluded that their amazing and powerful abilities were gifts from the Gods for them to take advantage of. Much to his dismay, his brother opposed this and caused his incarceration at Cape Junion. After his redemption, however, Kanon becomes a much centered person, much like his brother.\n \n Kanon was the one person responsible for Poseidon\'s awakening, although he kept Poseidon just half awakened so that he could pose as the true leader of the Marines as a Marine General and use Poseidon\'s army to achieve his desires. In order to do so, Kanon stole the scales of Sea Dragon and pretented to be the Sea Dragon General under Poseidon\'s order.\n Even after joining forces with the Athena, Kanon retains his ruthless personality and harsh characteristics scolding Pegasus Seiya and Andromeda Shun that they should never hesitate to finish their enemies, because their hesitation is a weakness that their enemies would take advantage of.

Aphrodite was a Saint famous not only because of his incredible, mesmerizing beauty, but also for his reputation as one of the strongest among the 88 Saints. However, this reputation is not explored very well in the series itself, as he is killed by Andromeda Shun rather easily by Gold Saint standards, and is beaten rather easily by Aries Mu during the Hades Saga.\n \n Gold Saint Gemini Saga once stated that Aphrodite\'s beauty was the greatest among Athena\'s Saints. Kurumada named him after the Greek Goddess of love and beauty as a reference to the Greek myth associated to the Pisces constellation. However, Aphrodite never claimed to be the most beautiful creature, unlike the Silver Saint, Lizard Misty who claimed that even the stars\' splendor dimmed next to his glory.\n \n It is notable that despite his incomparable beauty, Aphrodite is not narcissistic. He is often described as cruel as his fellow Gold Saint, Cancer Deathmask, but not as sadistic. He is also ironic and sarcastic. According to Saga, despite his beauty, Aphrodite is the most feared of all the 88 Saints of Athena, however, as explained above, this may be due to his cruel nature as opposed to his fighting prowess. His reputation is supported more in the still non-canonical Saint Seiya Episode G, when Aphrodite appeared in front of the Titan\'s soldiers who were awe-struck due to his beauty but also paralyzed by fear in his presence.\n \n A recurring motif in the Pisces Saint is that he considers victory as the greatest beauty of all and, therefore, he believes what makes him really beautiful would not be his physique, but absolute power. Aphrodite is depicted as a man who believes the power is the only way to keep the order and assure the justice. Subscribing to this theory, he believes the stronger is allowed to rule over the weak.\n \n Some casual fans believe Aphrodite is a female because of his name. In the French, European Spanish&mdash;first dubbing&mdash;and Chinese dubbing of the anime adaptation, he is voiced by a female actress.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 17970,   ["firstname"] = "Polaris", ["lastname"] = "Hilda",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Hilda  Polaris", }, ["description"] = "Odin\'s representative on Earth and ruler of Asgard, she is possessed by the Nibelung Ring controlled by Poseidon and plans to kill Athena and rule the Sanctuary instead of her.",}, {["mal_id"] = 94915,   ["firstname"] = "Arles", ["lastname"] = "Pope",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Pope Arles \"Great Master", " Grand Pope\"", }, ["description"] = "Arles is the Pope of Athena\'s Sactuary and the main enemy of the first arcs.  \n About 13 years prior the main events of Saint Seiya, the Pope Arles tried to kill Athena with a golden dagger when she was a baby.

The Pope attacked Aiolos, but he managed to escape from the Sanctuary, leaving Athena and the Sagittarius Gold Cloth to the care of Mitsumasa Kido. \n \n Once the Pope Arles was informed of the Galaxian Wars tournament between the Bronze Saints, and that the Sagittarius Gold Cloth was in the possession of the real Athena, he sent some Silver Saints to kill the Bronze Saints. However, the Silver Saints couldn&rsquo;t affirm their rank superiority and were defeated by the Bronze Saints.\n \n The Twelve Temple arc spoilers:\n \n Later, in the Twelve Temples arc, it\'s revealed that the man who stole the identity of Pope and tried to kill Athena was Gemini Saga. In order to steal the throne and disguise himself as the Pope, Saga killed the previous one, Aries Shion.\n \n From this day onwards, Saga ruled the Sanctuary as the Pope Arles. In his favor, most of the Saints didn\'t know of Shion\'s murder and Saga\'s betrayal. Some of them knew it, but silenced about it.\n \n At the end of the battle of the Twelve Temples, Saga revealed his identity as the Pope to Seiya. It\'s also revealed that Saga suffered from a split personality disorder: his evil side was dominant, and lead the Sactuary as the Pope Arles.

There, the Grand Pope revealed that their goddess had once again reincarnated in the form of an infant, and so the Sanctuary must prepare itself for the imminent wars. As Shion himself was getting on in years, he decided that it was time to appoint one of the twelve Gold Saints as the successor to his seat. At the time, most of the Gold Saints were still too young; only Gemini Saga and Sagittarius Aioros were most qualified. The Pope eventually selected Aioros as the new Pope, and asked Saga to serve as an assistant to the Sagittarius Saint. \n Saga, possessed by his evil side, became jealous at the fact that he was not chosen for the seat, especially since he believed that he was superior to Aioros in terms of power and wisdom. Saga confronted Shion regarding his decision and killed him. He disguised himself with the Grand Pope\'s garments, and left to kill the infant Athena. Inches before Saga could dig the golden dagger into the baby\'s belly, Aioros appeared and halted the blade from striking the death blow. The Sagittarius berated the man he assumed to be the Pope, but was quickly shoved aside. After a minute of struggle, Aioros sent Saga flying into the nearest wall, knocking off his headdress and mask. Upon seeing Saga\'s face and realizing that Saga had killed the Grand Pope, Aioros immediately snatched away the infant Athena and ran off from Sanctuary.\n \n Saga, disguised as the Pope once more, sounded the alarm and sent guards to go after the saint. It is at this point that he officially branded Aioros as a \"traitor.\" He was eventually found by Capricorn Shura and managed to flee, but was deadly injured.\n \n As he was dying, he ran into Mitsumasa Kido, who was touring Greece at the time. Aioros begged the elder Kido to become Athena\'s new guardian, and explained to him the travesty that had taken place at the Sanctuary. Along with other secrets, Kido learned about the existence of Athena\'s Saints and their Cloths. Entrusting the elder Kido with Athena and his own Sagittarius Gold Cloth, Aioros succumbed to his injuries. It is unknown as to where exactly Aioros died and buried, as the whereabouts of the location is omitted in the series.\n \n After his death, Aioros\' spirit would provide assistance for Athena and her Saints. He has aided Seiya in battles by lending the young bronze saint the Sagittarius Gold Cloth time and time again, and even appeared once to his brother Aiolia during Aiolia\'s fight with Seiya, when he demanded proof of Saori\'s identity as the goddess Athena. When the bronze saints were in the Temple of Sagittarius, the Sagittarius Cloth moved on its own (or with Aioros\' spirit), and fired its golden arrow into a nearby wall&mdash;revealing a final hidden message of the gold saint\'s last will: \"To you young boys who have reached this temple, know that I entrust Athena\'s life in your hands. Aioros.\" It is likely that Aioros foresaw that one day, new Saints would go to his temple to fight for Athena.\n \n When Athena\'s saints were once again fighting against Hades\'s spectres, all the Gold Saints, both dead and alive, gathered in Hades\' room to break the Wailing Wall. Only with sunlight can the wall be destroyed, and because each individual gold cloth contained a bit of solar energy, gathering all twelve would provide enough of it to properly damage the wall. At this point, the spirit of Aioros appeared with the rest of the recently deceased Gold Saints to aid their comrades in accomplishing this task. Focusing on a single point of the Wailing Wall, Aioros guided all twelve gold saints\' individual attacks into one, and struck the wall. Once the mission was completed, Aioros and the rest of the gold saints dissipated, leaving only the gold cloth behind.\n \n Although Aioros\' moves were not shown in the original manga, there are nevertheless two techniques that were attributed to him in other mediums: one in the anime adaptation, and another in Episode G.\n \n They are:\n - Atomic Thunderbolt (atomikku sand\xc4\x81boruto): Aioros shoots a massive amount of energy balls with some electric charge. This attack is from the anime, and was revealed during a flashback fight against Capricorn Shura.\n - Infinity Break (infiniti bureiku): This technique allows Aioros to shoot an infinite number of light darts that pierce anything upon contact. With this attack, Aioros destroyed Horus\' army in Saint Seiya: Episode G.\n \n Aioros\' cloth, Sagittarius Cloth, is armed with a bow and a golden arrow. This arrow is often depicted as the main weapon of the series and gives the final blow in four of the five movies of the series when is used by Pegasus Seiya. It was hinted on the original series and confirmed in Saint Seiya Episode G that the golden arrow can concentrate the Cosmos of those surrounding it if they wish.\n \n Even though most fans recognize his given name as Aiolos, the true intention of Masami Kurumada was to name him Aioros, a Japanization the name of the Greek god of the winds Aiolos. This can be confirmed in vol.11 of Kurumada\'s manga, in Aioros\' testament. Kurumada drew capitalized Greek letters spelling the character\'s name as Aioros: &Alpha;\xe1\xbc\xb8&Omicron;\xe1\xbf\xac&Omicron;&Sigma;. He clearly used a \"R\" instead of an \"L,\" in the spelling of the name. If he had wanted to spell it Aiolos, he would have drew them as: &Alpha;\xe1\xbc\xb4&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf; or &Alpha;\xe1\xbc\xb8&Omicron;&Lambda;&Omicron;&Sigma;. Some attribute the discrepancy to the fact that in Japanese, the letter \"L\" doesn\'t exist, and is replaced by the letter \"R\" in foreign words. The fandom in general is mostly familiarized with the more \"Greek\" spelling, Aiolos, though in some languages, such as in the Latin-American Spanish dub of the anime, the arguably more Kurumada-accurate \"Aioros\" is used.\n \n As revealed by Masami Kurumada in vol.12 of his manga, Aioros became a Gold Saint at an early age. He had already been granted the Gold Saint status and the Sagittarius Gold Cloth before the time he was 14 years old.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 8766,   ["firstname"] = "Scorpio", ["lastname"] = "Milo",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Milo  Scorpio", }, ["description"] = "Age: 20 Birthday: November 8\n Nationality: Greece\n Height: 185cm\n Weight: 84 kg\n Blood type: B \n \n Scorpio Milo is one of the Gold Saints.

During the conflict of the twelve temples, Milo first opposed the Bronze Saints\' insurrection, as the Pope Saga tricked him into deeming them traitors and regarding Saori Kido a usurper of Athena\'s name. \n \n He is engaged in a fierce duel by Cygnus Hy\xc5\x8dga, the battle becoming so intense, Milo is forced to use his killing strike Antares, for the very first time, on Hy\xc5\x8dga. Moribund, Hy\xc5\x8dga crawls desperately to try to save the wounded Saori\'s life. Milo is shocked by Hy\xc5\x8dga\'s determination and loyalty, and realizes that they can come only from devotion to the true Athena, and neutralizes Antares\' effects to save Hy\xc5\x8dga\'s life, and confirms his suspicions. \n \n After the defeat of Saga, Milo pledges loyalty to Saori Kido as he recognized her as the true Athena. During the holy war against Poseidon, Milo was eager to invade the Submarine Temple to join the battle against the god\'s Marina Generals and save the Bronze Saints\' lives, being restrained from doing so by Aries Mu, since the Gold Saints were to be a crucial asset in the upcoming war against Hades, which broke out within mere weeks. \n \n In the war against Hades, Milo protects Athena and subjects Gemini Kanon to a tortuous trial to prove his devotion to the goddess, and recognizes him as a true Gold Saint.\n \n Later on, Milo is defeated by Wyvern Rhadamanthys and thrown into the Cocytos prison. In the climax of the battle, Milo is revitalized by Athena\'s Cosmo, and offers his life along his Gold Saint comrades in the final sacrifice to pierce the impervious Wailing Wall.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 18724,   ["firstname"] = "Seika", ["lastname"] = "Seika",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Seika", }, ["description"] = "No biography written.",}, {["mal_id"] = 46225,   ["firstname"] = "Sho", ["lastname"] = "Sho",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Sho", }, ["description"] = "The Steel Saint of Toucan.

As the guardian of the Temple of Virgo along the path of Sanctuary, Shaka has played a pivotal role chiefly in the battle between Athena and the Pope in the Sanctuary arc, and also in the Hades arc. He is referred to many times on the story as the \"the man who is almost a god\" (or closest to attain godhood) due to his immense power and is also considered the only Gold Saint that has full control over the Araya Shiki (8th sense).\n \n Shaka alone of all saints occupies the rarefied spot between God and man, but living between two worlds has its blessings as well as curses. As a Bodhisattva, and endowed with the most powerful cosmos of all the saints even overpowering Libra Dohko\'s and Aries Shion\'s Cosmos, Shaka well deserves his reputation as the man closest to God. Even as a child in India, Shaka was precocious and communed with God himself--a scene recounted in the flashbacks moments before Shaka\'s death in the Twin Sala\'s Garden. For someone whose life has just begun, he had been unusually sensitive to sufferings and mortality of human life. Seeing pain and death as reflected in the Ganges gives the boy Shaka enough despair, if not a crisis of faith. With esoteric learning and training, Shaka eventually became powerful enough to don the Gold Cloth of Virgo, which he wore even as a boy in the manga, and wise enough to rise above human passions and attachments. For most of his life, he would look on human feelings with a mix of pity and compassion without being bound to them, with charity but not always with love. Detachment seems to be Shaka\'s answer to the poignant questions raised by human life, and he is seeing humanity from the point of God rather than living the experience. He would be disabused of this attitude in his encounter with Ikki. In the end, Shaka would have to remember that he is a man, as well, and return to whence he came.\n \n He often casts illusions to deceive his enemies. A probably illusionary technique is Transmigration (or Reincarnation) to the Six Paths (\xe5\x85\xad\xe9\x81\x93\xe8\xbc\xaa\xe5\xbb\xbb Rikud\xc5\x8d Rinne?) in which Shaka sends his opponent to one of the six Dharma\'s rebirth realms. These realms are, as described by Kurumada: Gakikai (the realm of the preta), Jinkai (the realm of humans), Jigokukai (the realm of hell), Chikush\xc5\x8dkai (the realm of beasts), Shurakai (the realm of the warring demigods) and finally Tenkai (the realm of heaven). Interestingly enough, Kurumada presents the Buddhist realms of reincarnation as separate planes of existence from those found in the Hades arc of his manga, which he derived from Dante Alighieri\'s conception of the underworld. The Tenkai is considered the worst realm to be sent as mentioned by Shaka.\n \n Shaka strengthens his Cosmos energy by depriving himself of his eyesight. When he opens his eyes, the stored strength is then released. Due to his enormous power, Shaka is called the \"man who is closest to god\". He can also use H\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x83 (\xe3\x82\xab\xe3\x83\xbc\xe3\x83\xb3 K\xc4\x81n?), a defensive technique that creates a barrier that encircles Shaka\'s body.\n \n Between his offensive techniques he can use Demon Pacifier (\xe5\xa4\xa9\xe9\xad\x94\xe9\x99\x8d\xe4\xbc\x8f Tenma K\xc5\x8dfuku?) to expand his cosmos at multiple targets or at a single one as a blast, that it was strong enough to destroy a large part of the Cancer Temple and Heaven Supremacy on evil spirits of rivers and mountains (\xe5\xa4\xa9\xe7\xa9\xba\xe8\xa6\x87\xe9\x82\xaa\xe9\xad\x91\xe9\xad\x85\xe9\xad\x8d\xe9\xad\x8e Tenk\xc5\xabhajachimim\xc5\x8dry\xc5\x8d?) in which Shaka summons minor spirits and sends them against his enemies.\n \n Shaka\'s most powerful move, The Treasures of Heavens (\xe5\xa4\xa9\xe8\x88\x9e\xe5\xae\x9d\xe8\xbc\xaa Tenbuh\xc5\x8drin?), is an offensive and defensive combined technique. Not only traps and defangs Shaka\'s victims, it also wipes out their five senses named as \"Remove of the 1st/2nd/3rd/4th/5th sense\" (Dai Ikkan/Nikan/Sankan/Yonkan/Gokan Hakudatsu). Essentially reduces Shaka\'s victims to living corpses by stopping the main functions of the brain that allows the body to think, also called the 6th sense. The offensive power of this attack is so destructive that it can easily destroy the cloth of the opponent.\n \n Apart from those fighting techniques, Shaka also uses two concentration ones that belong to the Hinduism and buddhism like Om(\xe0\xa5\x90) to maximize his Cosmo energy, allowing him to use the full extent of his power and Tenp\xc5\x8drin Mudra (\xe8\xbb\xa2\xe6\xb3\x95\xe8\xbc\xaa\xe5\x8d\xb0 Tenp\xc5\x8drin\'in?) to erase any doubts in his mind that could refrain him during the fight. Tenp\xc5\x8drin is the japanese name for the Dharmacakra.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 18732,   ["firstname"] = "Wolf", ["lastname"] = "Nachi",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Nachi  Wolf", }, ["description"] = "No biography written.",}},
