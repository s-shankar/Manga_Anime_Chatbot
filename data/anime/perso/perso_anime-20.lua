When she first meets Naruto she is physically weak and has an immense crush on Sasuke. She dislikes Naruto as well.The only thing she\'s good at is her brain as the smartest girl in ninja academy her excellent chakra control, out of that she could be categorized as a kunoichi. In the first part of the Chuunin exam she is easily able to answer the questions, but in the second part she is unable to defeat the Sound ninja attacking Sasuke and Naruto. She makes a pledge to become a better ninja and a better person. To prove her commitment she cuts her long hair with a kunai.\n \n In the third part of the Chuunin Exam she goes up against Ino Yamanaka, her former friend but current rival for Sasuke\'s affections. The two defeat each other simultaneously. This turns their relationship in a rivalry between friends.\n \n After the time skip she is now a chuunin having been trained by Tsunade for the past two years. She is now a medic Ninja of considerable skill, enough skill to possibly defeat Tsunade one day. It is shown when she is able to do a complicated surgery to extract poisons out of Kankuro body and make an antidote of the new type poison that Sasori used,which the Suna gakure medical-nin unable to do.\n \n During the time skip she\'s also matured in personality, she become calmer compare when she were Genin, but she still has her temper especially when Naruto is fooling around in front of her she will beat him up into a bloody pulp. \n \n Sakura has grown not only as a medical-nin, now she\'s also a capable fighter. She can manage to destroy the ground with her fist using her inhuman strength, a chakra control technique she learned from Tsunade, and she is also able to beat Sasori from Akatsuki together with elder Chiyo from Sunagakure.  Additionally she is a genjutsu type, and though she has yet to use that potential she does show an almost complete immunity to being trapped in an illusion.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 85,   ["firstname"] = "Hatake", ["lastname"] = "Kakashi",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Kakashi \"The Copy Ninja\" Hatake", }, ["description"] = "Age: 26-27 (Part I); 29-31 (Part II) Birthday: September 15\n Horoscope: Virgo\n Blood Type: O\n Height: 5\"11\"\n Weight: 67.5 kg \n Hair: Silver\n Eyes: Grey, Sharingan\n Rank: Jonin, Former ANBUHokage\n Likes: Icha-Icha series, Broiled Saury with salt, Miso soup with eggplant\n Dislikes: Anything sweet\n Quote: (from Obito) \"A shinobi who violates the rules is scum, but a shinobi who abandons their friends is worse than scum\".\n \n Major Background SpoilersLike his father, Sakumo Hatake whose skills have been compared to that of the Legendary Ninja, Kakashi is considered a genius shinobi, graduating from the Ninja Academy at age 5 and achieving the rank of Chunin at 6. A few years after these accomplishments, Kakashi\'s father was disgraced by the village for abandoning a mission in favor of saving his comrades, which cost the Land of Fire dearly. Deeply ashamed and ostracized even by those he had saved, Sakumo committed seppuku, leaving Kakashi to bear witness to the event. After his father\'s suicide, Kakashi began to adhere strictly to the rules of the shinobi &ndash; in particular the rule dictating that the success of the mission must come before the well being of one\'s teammates, causing him to become arrogant, humorless, and by-the-book.\n \n During an attempt to save Rin, Kakashi lost his left eye as a result of taking an enemy ninja\'s attack for Obito. To protect Kakashi in return, Obito managed to awaken his Sharingan and killed their assailant. Soon after saving Rin, a rockfall technique was triggered and a rock struck Kakashi on his blind side. He would have been buried beneath the rocks had Obito not pushed Kakashi out of the way, getting the right side of his body almost completely crushed in the process. Shortly before he died, Obito had Rin (a medical ninja) implant his Sharingan eye in Kakashi\'s damaged eye socket as a gift. As his first act with his new eye, Kakashi avenged Obito by killing the enemy ninja with his now-perfected Chidori technique, bringing the Kakashi of today into being.\n \n Years later Kakashi would become a member of the Konohagakure ANBU where he served as a squad leader. During this time, he had several k\xc5\x8dhai, named Yugao Uzuki and Tenzo, and recognized the latter as the most successful of his k\xc5\x8dhai. It is unknown when or why he left ANBU, but he still wears iron guards on his gloves, a characteristic of ANBU uniforms.\n \n Obito\'s death profoundly changed Kakashi, and Kakashi adopted many of Obito\'s traits. One such trait was Obito\'s concept of teamwork, which is most clearly seen in the way Kakashi tests newly-graduated students hoping to become a squad under him. He uses the bell test to test his students, which requires the three students to get the two bells he keeps on his person. Only those who get a bell get to pass, which would be difficult even with teamwork, as at least one ninja would fail regardless. However, the rule is only a ruse; the point of the test is to foster teamwork and to teach the students that teamwork is more important than the rules. Team 7 is the only team to realize this, and as such becomes the only team Kakashi passes into Genin-status. Kakashi also inherits Obito\'s chronic tardiness, due primarily to losing track of time during his frequent visits to Konoha\'s memorial site, where Obito\'s name is engraved. Ironically, this very habit is one that Kakashi was often annoyed at Obito about. Obito was supposedly late due to random good deeds. Kakashi\'s personal life appears to be as much of a mystery as the face behind the mask he has worn for most of his ninja career. He has no living family, or at least none he cares to acknowledge, and he\'s confirmed that everyone he loves is already dead.\n Kakashi has an ongoing, albeit slightly one-sided, rivalry with Might Guy, with Guy constantly proclaiming that Kakashi is his rival, and considering his and Kakashi\'s subordinates rivals. Kakashi, however, seems indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys Guy to no end. Guy randomly challenges Kakashi to contests of skill, and Kakashi has acquired a record of 49 wins and 50 losses in doing so. Given that the contests that make up this figure are so varied (ranging from Rock, Paper, Scissors to sumo-wrestling), this is not much of an achievement on Guy\'s part. Nevertheless, Guy is proud of his record.\n \n Though he evasively says that he has \"many hobbies\" when asked about himself, he is commonly seen reading of \"Icha Icha Paradise\" (\xe3\x82\xa4\xe3\x83\x81\xe3\x83\xa3\xe3\x82\xa4\xe3\x83\x81\xe3\x83\xa3\xe3\x83\x91\xe3\x83\xa9\xe3\x83\x80\xe3\x82\xa4\xe3\x82\xb9, Icha Icha Paradaisu, literally \"Make Out Paradise\"), an adult and probably pornographic novel authored by Jiraiya that is a runaway bestseller in the Naruto world. Kakashi most prominently reads it while training and speaking with his team, and is later seen reading the second known volume in the series, \"Icha Icha Violence\" (\xe3\x82\xa4\xe3\x83\x81\xe3\x83\xa3\xe3\x82\xa4\xe3\x83\x81\xe3\x83\xa3\xe3\x83\x90\xe3\x82\xa4\xe3\x82\xaa\xe3\x83\xac\xe3\x83\xb3\xe3\x82\xb9, Icha Icha Baiorensu, literally \"Make Out Violence\"). In Part II Naruto gives him the new \"Icha Icha Tactics\" (\xe3\x82\xa4\xe3\x83\x81\xe3\x83\xa3\xe3\x82\xa4\xe3\x83\x81\xe3\x83\xa3\xe3\x82\xbf\xe3\x82\xaf\xe3\x83\x86\xe3\x82\xa3\xe3\x82\xaf\xe3\x82\xb9, Icha Icha Takutikusu, literally \"Make Out Tactics\").\n \n Kakashi\'s Sharingan eye gives him a significant advantage in battle, as he can copy enemy techniques and use them as his own, as well as track and predict his opponent\'s movements flawlessly. Because it is a transplanted eye, his Sharingan eye is always active. While this would not be much of a problem for an Uchiha, his non-Uchiha blood causes it to use much more chakra than it should. Because of this, he covers it with his headband and only utilizes it in the most dangerous battles. Kakashi\'s use of the Sharingan is as good as that of Itachi Uchiha, though the aforementioned handicaps brought about by the nature of his eye make him somewhat weaker in comparison. In Part II Kakashi is able to develop his own Mangekyo Sharingan. With his variant he is able to manipulate space-time to conduct long range attacks, and in its two uses has been capable of severing another\'s arms and otherwise sending things to different dimensions. Much like the standard Sharingan, the Mangekyo Sharingan tires Kakashi considerably, and after using it only three times he was hospitalized for a week due to its chakra usage.\n \n With his Sharingan Kakashi has been able to copy more than one thousand jutsu, giving him the nickname \"Copy Ninja Kakashi\". As a result, Kakashi\'s arsenal most prominently features ninjutsu abilities and has led to him becoming a specialist in the field. Many of the jutsu he has been seen copying in the series are water-based attacks, though most of these he only uses against the person he copies them from. He does, however, use Water Release: Water Encampment Wall on occasion as a way to block attacks. He less frequently uses other elemental attacks such as Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique to attack opponents or Earth Release: Inner Decapitation Technique (\xe5\x9c\x9f\xe9\x81\x81\xe3\x83\xbb\xe5\xbf\x83\xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\xac\xe9\xa6\x96\xe3\x81\xae\xe8\xa1\x93, Doton: Shinj\xc5\xab Zanshu no Jutsu, Viz \"Groundhog Technique Decapitation\", English TV \"Headhunter Jutsu\") to pull opponents below ground and immobilize them. He can also create shadow clones, though because he lacks Naruto\'s chakra reserves, he exercises the ability with caution, rarely creating more than one at a time.\n \n While Kakashi specializes in the use of ninjutsu due to his Sharingan he is fairly adept with other jutsu types, though his use of them is rarely seen. Demonic Illusion: Hell Viewing Technique (\xe9\xad\x94\xe5\xb9\xbb\xe3\x83\xbb\xe5\xa5\x88\xe7\x83\x99\xe8\xa6\x8b\xe3\x81\xae\xe8\xa1\x93, Magen: Narakumi no Jutsu) causes his opponent to see what they would find a horrifying vision, keeping them preoccupied until they can overcome the illusion. A Thousand Years of Pain (death in english dub) (\xe5\x8d\x83\xe5\xb9\xb4\xe6\xae\xba\xe3\x81\x97, Sennen Goroshi) consists of Kakashi forcefully plunging his index and middle fingers into an opponent\'s rectum. While only capable of launching the opponent humorous distances in typical uses, the fingers can be replaced with kunai attached with exploding tags to actually do damage to the person one is attacking.\n \n When he was younger Kakashi was taught how to use the Rasengan by the Fourth Hokage. Because the Rasengan is meant to have the user\'s chakra nature mixed with it, Kakashi attempted to add his lightning-based chakra to it, though was ultimately unsuccessful. In time he instead created the Chidori, his only original jutsu. After the jutsu\'s initial creation Kakashi was unable to use the Chidori to its full potential as the sheer speed of the attack left his normal eyes unable to see any form of an enemy counterattack. After acquiring the Sharingan, however, he was able to overcome this shortcoming. Through repeated use and increased proficiency with it, Kakashi\'s Chidori has been upgraded and renamed to the Lightning Blade due to him having cut through a bolt of lightning with it.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 13,   ["firstname"] = "Uchiha", ["lastname"] = "Sasuke",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Sasuke  Uchiha", }, ["description"] = "Age: 12-13 (I); 16-17 (II); 19 (The Last: Naruto the Movie); 32 (Boruto: Naruto the Movie) Birthday: July 23\n Ninja Registration No: 012606\n Horoscope: Leo\n Blood type: AB\n Height: 153.2 cm(I); 168 cm (II); 175 cm (The Last: Naruto the Movie); 182 cm (Boruto: Naruto the Movie)\n Weight: 43.5kg(I); 52.2kg (II); 55kg (The Last: Naruto the Movie); 65kg (Boruto: Naruto the Movie)\n Hair: Ebony Black with Blue tints\n Eyes: Black; Right eye Red (when using Sharingan) & Left eye Purple (when using Rinnengan)\n Rank: Genin; Missing Nin [II]\n Kekkei Genkai: Sharingan (Part 1)\n Mangekyo Sharingan, Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan (Part 2)\n Rinnegan awakening and Sage of the six path powers\n Likes: Omusubi (Okaka) (omusubi is like Onigiri: Okaka is dried Bonito) Tomato\n Dislikes: Everything that gets in the way of his revenge, natto (fermented soybeans) and sweet food\n Hates: Itachi (Part I)\n Konoha and its upper echelons (part II)\n Talents: Highly skilled ninja, specializes in fire and lightning jutsu.\n \n When Sasuke was young, his clan was murdered by his older brother, Itachi. With his parents and family now gone, his brother spared him and left him to survive by himself. He told Sasuke to hate him. Sasuke tried to forget about the past by applying himself in the ninja academy and fitting in with the rest of the leaf village.\n \n After his fight with Naruto, he believes he\'s been wasting his time \"playing ninja\" with the people of the leaf village. His new goal is to get stronger so he can avenge his clan by killing Itachi and then restore the Uchiha clan.\n \n As a wielder of the Sharingan (the kekkei genkai of the Uchiha clan), he learns to use Chidori and has a vast knowledge of the various Fire Jutsus. The curse seal which Orichimaru gives him during the Chuunin exam, at first, enhanced his power but at the risk of killing him. Now he can use it of his own free will.\n \n Claiming at first that he doesn\'t need any friends, he is forced to contradict himself when he sees that either Naruto or Sakura are in danger. Remembering this type of Sasuke is what brings motivation to Naruto. Sasuke openly admitted to Naruto that he was his closest friend.\n \n <b>Appearance</b>\n Sasuke has black hair with a blue tint that lengthens as the story goes with onyx eyes and has lighter skin than his brother Itachi. Like many other members of his clan, his hair hangs over both sides of his face to roughly his cheeks. In his curse seal form, he has grey skin with wings on his back that resemble giant webbed hands. He also has hair similar to Madara Uchiha except in a greyish-blue color.\n \n At the beginning of Part I, Sasuke\'s clothing made up a blue, short-sleeved shirt with a raised collar and the Uchiha crest on the back and white shorts. An interesting thing is that during Part I the Uchiha symbol on his back gets smaller each time he changes his outfit. In the last stage of the Chunin exams, he wore a black, one pieced version of this outfit but eventually went back to his original clothes.\n \n In Part II, Sasuke has grown noticeably taller (almost eye height with Itachi) and slightly more muscular. wears a white long sleeved shirt that\'s open at the torso with a smaller version of the Uchiha crest on his collar. He wears black pants with a blue cloth hanging from his half way up his stomach to his knees. He also wears a purple rope belt (Japanese name: Shimenawa) tied in a bow fashion found on many Sound ninja, only the bow is in a different style and is tied in the front instead of the back. He also will at points remove his shirt and hang it from his belt around his waist to give his wings in Curse Seal Level 2 room to move (also without transforming).\n \n Sasuke, even though claiming to be emotionless, wouldn\'t kill unless it was necessary until Madara Uchiha twisted his personality even further by telling him that his brother, Itachi, after he had killed him, was ordered to kill their clan and suffer for the sake of the village. After knowing this, he suddenly turns far colder and seeks for revenge on Konoha. However, after he had calmed down, he noticed how confused he really was and revived Orochimaru to request answers to his questions about his clan, Konoha, and what shinobi and the Hokage really are. He\'s currently helping Naruto and the others put an end to the war and announced that he plans to become the next Hokage. But when the the war concluded, Sasuke made it clear that his goal was to become a new kind of Hokage, a kind of Hokage that wants to banish darkness from the Ninja World and to do so he believes all the old Kages should be killed. He also wants to conclude things with Naruto and so he invites him to one final concluding battle. The battle ends with both Naruto and Sasuke losing one of their hands. While both lie on the ground he finally accepts Naruto\'s feelings and stops his path of revenge to return to the village.\n In chapter 700, it is shown that he has a daughter with Sakura.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 17,   ["firstname"] = "Uzumaki", ["lastname"] = "Naruto",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Naruto \"Nine-Tails Jinchuuriki\" Uzumaki", }, ["description"] = "Age: 12-13 (Naruto part I), 15-17 (part II), 19 (The Last: Naruto the Movie), 27 (Naruto epilogue), 32 (Boruto: Naruto the Movie) Birthday: October 10\n Blood type: B\n Height: 145&ndash;147 cm (I), 166 cm (II), 174 cm (The Last: Naruto the Movie), 180 cm (Boruto: Naruto the Movie)\n Weight: 41&ndash;44 kg (I), 52 kg (II), 56 kg (The Last: Naruto the Movie), 66 kg (Boruto: Naruto the Movie)\n Favorite food: Ichiraku ramen\n \n Born in Konohagakure, a ninja village hidden in the leaves, Naruto Uzumaki was destined for greatness. When born, a powerful nine-tailed demon fox attacked his village. With a wave of its tail, the demon fox could raise tsunamis and shatter mountains. In a valiant attempt to save the village from destruction, the Fourth Hokage, the leader of the Hidden Leaf Village, sealed the demon fox within Naruto\'s newborn body. This was his final act, for the battle with the fox cost him his life.\n \n Despite the Fourth Hokage\'s dying wish that Naruto be viewed as a hero for serving as the container for the demon (a <i>Jinchuuriki</i>) the adult villagers of Konoha harbored a fierce hatred for him, with many believing that Naruto and the demon were one and the same. Cast aside as an inhuman monster, Naruto was outcast and ostracized by the villagers for reasons he could not understand. The children his age could only ever follow their parents\' example; and they too came to harbor a fierce hatred for Naruto.\n \n Naruto eventually came to accept that he would live and die alone, and his external response was to perform harmless pranks on the village. Coy, raffish and full of life, Naruto soon came to display a somewhat unexpected determination to succeed and be accepted by others. Upon being assigned to \"Team Seven\" as a Genin-ranked ninja, his true potential soon became outwardly apparent.\n \n Vowing to become Hokage one day and using his will to never give in, Naruto saves the village from invading forces and earns his acceptance. Eventually, Naruto learns to harness the power of the Demon Fox sealed inside him to perform acts of strength far beyond what any other human is capable of.\n \n In all, Naruto is an admirable character whose sheer determination to succeed despite the odds, earns him respect and devotion from his fellow villagers.\n \n He becomes the hero of his village, after defeating the six Pains all by himself.\n He then befriends the nine-tails inside of him and control its powers. In time, he also becomes more dependable considering the Shinobi Alliance completely relies and respects his power, even the reanimated previous Hokages.\n He later receives chakra from all the nine tailed beasts and then gains the power of the sage of the six paths, along with Sasuke.\n At the end of the manga, he is married to Hinata with two children, Boruto and Himawari, and becomes the seventh hokage.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 8997,   ["firstname"] = "Abumi", ["lastname"] = "Zaku",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Zaku  Abumi", }, ["description"] = "Zaku Abumi was a Genin-level ninja from Otogakure. He was part of the team that took the Chunin exam in order to assassinate Sasuke Uchiha. Like many Sound ninja, he has been physically altered with unnatural enhancements that enhance his abilities; in his case, he was fitted with hollow air tubes that extend through his arms and open through his hands, allowing him to propel a combination of air pressure and sound in various ratios, controlled by his chakra. Unlike his partners, a glance into his past and how Orochimaru recruited him was given, making him a far more dramatic character. The anime shows that he was an orphan living on the streets who hustled by stealing for a living, and was almost always beaten for it. Orochimaru had told him he had potential and liked the strength in his eyes. He refuses to give up, even at the cost of his own life. \n After saving his partner Dosu from Rock Lee\'s lotus attack, he brutally fought off Sakura who attempted to prevent him from killing Sasuke. After the helpless Sakura lay beaten on the ground, he and his team had to fight Team Asuma. During the fight, Sasuke finally regained consciousness, and asked Sakura who had injured her. Zaku took the credit, and Sasuke proceeded to dislocate and greatly injure Zaku\'s shoulders. He was the only Sound ninja to fight Sasuke, as the others retreated. During his fight with Shino Aburame in the preliminary exams, he overcame the injuries to his shoulders and was able to use his arms to defend himself against Shino. Due to his cockiness, he attempted to attack both Shino and his approaching army of Kekai insects, not noticing that the chakra-eating bugs had already filled the tubes in his arms, preventing him from attacking and even more brutally crippling and preventing him from doing any damage in the future (In the manga, his right arm was blown off due to the kikai bugs Shino used to fill up Zaku\'s air tubes, and the left was kept intact but halfway sliced. In the anime both of his arms are left intact, but have numerous holes in them, achieving the same, albeit less gruesome, result).

Because of this, his teammates often use food against him, such as offering him food as a reward for accomplishing a task or simply using his favorite foods as a form of blackmail. Despite his open display for his love of food, Choji is very sensitive about his size and becomes highly agitated when somebody calls him \"fat.\" Once called \"fat,\" Choji\'s resolve to fight is elevated to new levels and he becomes much more hostile to his opponents than he would otherwise. Just as they use food against him, Choji\'s teammates use this personality trait against him as well. Should Choji be reluctant to fight, one of them need only comment on his size to spur him into combat form.\n \n As an Akimichi, Choji\'s style of combat focuses on increasing his size.

Before joining Akatsuki, Deidara was as a terrorist bomber for hire, where his work attracted the attention of Pain. Pain sent other Akatsuki members to recruit Deidara, though he refused. After being defeated by Itachi Uchiha, however, Deidara was forced to join the organization. Deidara maintained a deep loathing for Itachi from that point further and became determined to defeat him, even training one of his eyes to overcome Itachi\'s signature ability: genjutsu. Deidara was partnered with Sasori upon joining the organization, whose artistic ability and insight Deidara admired. After Sasori\'s death Deidara is paired with Tobi whom he treats as a disciple. Despite Tobi\'s habit of accidentally angering Deidara, Deidara takes great care to keep Tobi out of harm\'s way and even dedicates his final moments to apologizing to him.\n \n In battle, Deidara uses special mouths in the palm of each hand to create Exploding Clay, chakra-infused clay that explodes on command. He commonly uses the command \"Katsu\" to trigger it. The blast strength of his creations is determined by how much chakra he adds to them. His clay can take on any size or form, ranging from microscopic in size to copies of himself as tall as a skyscraper. Deidara refers to his creations as art, believing the most beautiful thing about them to be their detonation. His admiration for his art is such that he believes it can\'t be defeated, leading to overconfidence in battle. Depending on the complexity or potency of one of his works, Deidara applies it a designation from anywhere between \"C1\" to \"C4\", the former being the most basic and the latter being his strongest and most complex attack. For his final act, Deidara also has a mouth on his chest that, once provided with clay, turns him into a living bomb that destroys everything in a 10 kilometer radius.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 17537,   ["firstname"] = "Dengaku", ["lastname"] = "Dengaku",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Dengaku", }, ["description"] = "Dengaku is a food stand merchant in the Fire Country who sells a variety of things.

Over time, those with \"Advanced Blood\" came to be hated and feared. This forced those with advanced bloods into hiding in order to live in peace. Haku was one of the few people in the Mist with Advanced Blood left. \n When Haku was just a young child, his father discovered that his wife was part of an Advanced Bloodline. Haku\'s father proceeded to kill his mother and then went after him. In Haku\'s fright, he killed his father and fled his small village, believing himself to be a monster: a monster loved by no one.\n \n On one faithful day, Haku looked up in the slums of the back alley to see a Shinobi staring down at him, this Shinobi was Zabuza. Haku then proclaimed, \"You have the same eyes as me\". Zabuza realized that Haku was one of the Advanced Bloodline limit carriers, and took the child under his wing. Haku was raised by Zabuza as \"a tool\" to be called upon when needed in exchange for his \"freedom\" from the slums. He learned how to use his unique abilities and eventually became a Hunter-Nin. When Zabuza\'s plan to kill Mizukage fails, Haku fled the village along with Zabuza to fulfill his job as a veritable \"a tool.\"\n \n Haku\'s slender frame and delicate appearance enables him to disguise himself in various ways. In fact, while finding medicine to treat Zabuza\'s wounds Haku runs into Naruto. Naruto mistakenly believes Haku is a girl. As we see in the ensuing brawls, it is not appearance that determines strength. Rather, under that soft face we see that Haku has an adroit knack for speed and Jutsu skill. Combined with his knowledge of the human body, Haku can target his opponent\'s vital organs and kill them instantly using pinpoint accuracy. The main choice to attack these vital organs is with simple needles that are used by physicians in the battle field.\n \n Haku\'s bloodline originates in the country of Mist so it is no surprise that his Jutsus are water based. His \"Flying Water Needles\" is a technique whence he uses his chakra to create ice needles via water on the ground. Furthermore, he uses his chakra to control the path of the needles and strike the enemy. His other technique, \"Demonic Ice Mirrors\" uses water to create ice mirrors to surround the enemy. He then combines himself with the mirrors and uses the reflection to transport himself from mirror to mirror while attacking his enemy from all angles. His most incredible ability however, is the ability to do one-handed seals. This allows him to complete various tasks that are not capable of being accomplished without having a free hand.\n \n Although Haku is an exceptional fighter, he is a kind ninja who is saddened by unnecessary death. His fighting spirit comes from the will to protect his most \"precious person,\" because \"when a person has something precious to protect, that is when they can become truly strong.\"\n \n Haku is later \'revived\' by Kabuto using Impure World Resurrection during the fourth shinobi world war.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 88313,   ["firstname"] = "Mother", ["lastname"] = "Haku\'s",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Haku\'s Mother", }, ["description"] = "No biography written.",}, {["mal_id"] = 15178,   ["firstname"] = "Haruna", ["lastname"] = "Haruna",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Haruna", }, ["description"] = "No biography written.",}, {["mal_id"] = 67289,   ["firstname"] = "Haruno", ["lastname"] = "Mebuki",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Mebuki  Haruno", }, ["description"] = "Mebuki Haruno (\xe6\x98\xa5\xe9\x87\x8e\xe3\x83\xa1\xe3\x83\x96\xe3\x82\xad, Haruno Mebuki) is a kunoichi of Konohagakure and the wife of Kizashi and mother of Sakura Haruno. \n Anime Debut: Naruto Shipp\xc5\xabden Episode #271\n Movie Debut: Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 6 - Road to Ninja\n \n (source: Narutopedia)\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 23155,   ["firstname"] = "Hijiri", ["lastname"] = "Shimon",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Shimon  Hijiri", }, ["description"] = "Shimon Hijiri (\xe8\x81\x96\xe3\x82\xb7\xe3\x83\xa2\xe3\x83\xb3, Hijiri Shimon) is a Ch\xc5\xabnin from Konohagakure.

He gets along considerably better with Itachi than most Akatsuki members do with their own partners, immediately doing as Itachi asks of him and always looking out for Itachi\'s well-being. His former country, the Land of Water, now seeks him out for plotting to overthrow its government and being involved in numerous assassinations. When he was still loyal to Kirigakure, he was one of the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, a group of ninja that wield particularly large weapons in battle. Kisame\'s weapon is called Samehada, a scale-covered sword that shaves off skin instead of cutting and is capable of absorbing untold amounts of chakra. Samehada only allows Kisame to wield it; if anyone else tries to pick it up, spikes protrude from its handle and it returns to Kisame\'s side. Like other characters who have trained to be one of the Seven Swordsmen, Kisame enjoys mutilating his opponents, as seen when he suggests cutting off Naruto Uzumaki\'s legs to make him easier to carry.\n \n Kisame has a distinctive shark-like appearance, complete with pale blue skin, small white eyes, gill-like facial structures, and sharp triangular teeth. Even his name, Kisame, means \"demon shark\". His shark-like qualities carry over to the type of techniques he uses in battle, as he often shapes bodies of water into the forms of sharks that proceed to attack opponents. If there is no water source where he happens to be fighting, Kisame can use Water Release: Exploding Water Shockwave to create a lake\'s worth of water to be used for attacks. Kisame is also noted to have a particularly large reserve of chakra; even when he fights at 30% power in one instance his chakra supply is compared to that of a Nine-Tailed Demon Fox-enhanced Naruto Uzumaki.\n \n (Source: Naruto.com)\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 22880,   ["firstname"] = "Hyuuga", ["lastname"] = "Hizashi",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Hizashi  Hyuuga", }, ["description"] = "Hizashi Hyuuga was a member of the Hyuuga Clan.

Believing her to be of lesser skill than her younger sister, Hanabi Hyuga, her father left Hinata in Kurenai Yuhi\'s care once she was assigned to Team 8, claiming he didn\'t care what happened to her. Throughout her early time in Team 8, Hinata\'s lack of self-confidence and unwillingness to fight hamper her abilities. Although she would train to improve her skills, she would immediately give up when faced with competition and failed every mission she was assigned as a result.\n \n In an attempt to change herself, Hinata enters the Chunin Exams, where she is pit against her cousin, Neji Hyuga, in the exam\'s preliminary matches. Neji is quick to ridicule Hinata for her personality traits and attempts to convince her that she is a failure who will never be able to change herself, bringing her to tears. Naruto Uzumaki\'s encouragement, however, empowers her to fight her cousin despite repeatedly being struck down. Although she is defeated, Naruto\'s words have a lasting effect on Hinata and she becomes more confident in her abilities, and even sticks up for herself by telling Neji that he is the one who is attempting to fight against what cannot be changed. After recovering from her wounds, Hinata continues training to prove herself to her father and Naruto. Her efforts are successful in both regards, as she is eventually able to acquire a better relationship with her father, who encourages her to continue working on improving herself. Naruto has also come to hold her in a higher standing, and he tells her that while he had considered her timid and weird before, he now views her as a likable person.\n \n Hinata has a long-standing crush on Naruto, which has been present since their time in the Academy. Her feelings for him are rooted in his determination, confidence, and strength, all of which Hinata lacks. With her affection for Naruto, Hinata is constantly willing to break away from her normal personality traits in order to help him. She also becomes more assertive for Naruto, and also doesn\'t hesitate to defend him, even to himself. Her feelings for Naruto are one of the driving forces in her self-improvement, as she tries to gain strength in an attempt to both impress him and become like him. When they meet again in Part II, Hinata is unable to bring herself to greet Naruto and passes out when he comes to greet her, her feelings for him having apparently been amplified during his absence. Despite this, she gradually becomes more comfortable around Naruto, going from being unable to look him in the eye to being able to talk to him, and is able to work with him without difficulty when they are on missions together.\n \n As a member of the Hyuga clan, Hinata possesses the Byakugan, which gives her an almost 360 field of vision. During the Chunin Exams, she displays the ability to focus the Byakugan\'s sight, increasing the distance that her eyes can see. She also specializes in the Gentle Fist fighting style, which allows her to damage her opponent\'s chakra circulatory system and inner organs directly with even a slight tap. In her quest to get stronger, Hinata creates a new ability during the anime\'s Bikochu arc called Protection of the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms (\xe5\xae\x88\xe8\xad\xb7\xe5\x85\xab\xe5\x8d\xa6\xe5\x85\xad\xe5\x8d\x81\xe5\x9b\x9b\xe6\x8e\x8c, Shugohakke Rokuj\xc5\xabyon Sh\xc5\x8d), a combination of the Hyuga clan\'s most powerful techniques. With it Hinata emits streams of chakra from her palms to create extremely sharp blades that she can use to hit any target in her field of vision. Due to the speed at which these blades move, the amount of control she has over them, as well as her ability to manipulate their size, Hinata can use this technique to attack and defend simultaneously.\n \n Sometime after the fourth shinobi war, she marries Naruto and bears their two children, Boruto and Himawari.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 1694,   ["firstname"] = "Hyuuga", ["lastname"] = "Neji",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Neji  Hyuuga", }, ["description"] = "<b>Age</b>: 14 (I) ; 17 (II) <b>Birthday</b>: 3 July\n <b>Horoscope</b>: Cancer\n <b>Bloodtype</b>: 0\n <b>Height</b>: 172 cm\n <b>Weight</b>: 54.2 kg\n <b>Rank</b>: Genin (I); Jonin (II)\n <b>Likes</b>: soba noodles with herring, meditation\n <b>Dislikes</b>: pumpkin, spicy things\n \n Neji Hyuuga is a stoic member of Might Guy\'s Team Guy, consisting of himself, Rock Lee, and Tenten. Neji and Lee have somewhat of a rivalry, much like that of Guy and Kakashi Hatake. Lee is determined to prove that a \"failure\" such as himself can defeat a \"genius\" such as Neji. Neji, however, doesn\'t seem to be interested in this goal of Lee\'s, and Lee doesn\'t seem to have made an effort to prove the point to Neji. Despite this apparent clashing of ideals between the two, Neji seems to get along fairly well with Tenten, with the latter often helping Neji with his training. Neji and Tenten also tend to share opinions on Lee and Guy\'s overreactive behaviors, often wondering how they can train the way they do.\n \n As a member of the Hyuga clan, Neji has a Byakugan, allowing him to see the chakra flow of others and block the flow upon contact with his Gentle Fist style. As a member of the clan\'s branch house, Neji can never hope to be taught how to use the clan\'s most secret techniques by the clan\'s elders. Despite this, Neji has learned many of the clan\'s strongest techniques independently, even creating a few unique skills of his own. Because of this, Neji is known as a genius ninja and graduated from the Academy as the #1 rookie.\n \n Because his father, Hizashi Hyuga, was a member of a branch house of the Hyuga clan, Neji was born into the branch house. As a result, he was branded with the Hyuga branch family seal at a young age so that the members of the main house could keep him in check. Hizashi, believing Neji to be denied his potential as a branch house member, openly resented the main house, causing Neji to acquire the same feelings due to his father\'s influence. In time, Neji\'s hatred for the main house would increase exponentially as result of Hizashi being sacrificed to save the life of Hiashi Hyuga, Hizashi\'s twin brother. Neji believed that his father was forced to die for his twin brother. Because of this, Neji came to feel that fate was something decided at birth and that no matter what one does, people cannot escape their destiny. This idea would go on to shape Neji\'s life, creating a deep hatred for the main house and all of its members. \n \n After the Chunnin Exams when Neji fights Naruto his both his great skill and potential are recognized by the clan leader, his uncle Hiashi Hyuuga, and is sought out by him to train with the main branch of the family to further enhance Neji\'s skills. This helps ease some of the tensions between the two branches of the Hyuuga clan.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 15039,   ["firstname"] = "Hyuuga", ["lastname"] = "Hiashi",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Hiashi  Hyuuga", }, ["description"] = "<b>Gender:</b> Male <b>Age:</b> 40 (Part I), 42 (Part II)\n <b>Birthday:</b> January 8\n <b>Height</b>: 5\'8\"\n <b>Weight:</b> 146 lbs.\n <b>Blood Type:</b> B\n <b>Affiliation</b>: Konohagakure\n \n Hiashi Hyuga is the head of the Hyuga Clan.

The fact that Neji would never be able to succeed the clan, and that he would be marked with a curse mark so that he could be disciplined caused friction between the brothers.\n \n When his daughter, Hinata, was kidnapped by a the Head Ninja of Kumogakure no sato, who was acting as an ambassador to Konoha at the time, he had no choice but to kill her kidnapper. The Land of Lightning overlooked the kidnapping, and they demanded a life for a life, asking Hiashi surrender his life and be killed, or else a new wave of warfare between the Hidden Leaf and Cloud villages. While Hiashi planned on accepting the punishment, his brother insisted on taking his place, saying that while he hated the main family, he wanted to save his brother and decide his own destiny. He asked Hiashi to tell Neji about his decision and his reasons before leaving to be killed.\n \n Hiashi\'s general personality is very stern and strict, as he assigns both his daughters arduous training, rarely complimenting their performance. This is especially true with Hinata; when she was assigned to Kurenai Yuhi, he told her that he was unconcerned about the possibility that she would die, saying that the Hyuga Clan had no use for a weak successor.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 149423,   ["firstname"] = "Ibara", ["lastname"] = "Ibara",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Ibara", }, ["description"] = "Ibara is a citizen of Konohagakure and the mother of one of the students in Naruto Uzumaki\'s class at the Academy. \n (Source: Naruto Wikia)\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 21365,   ["firstname"] = "Inari", ["lastname"] = "Inari",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Inari", }, ["description"] = "Inari (\xe3\x82\xa4\xe3\x83\x8a\xe3\x83\xaa) is the son of Tsunami and the grandson of Tazuna.

For example, he vowed to walk 500 laps around Konoha on his hands if he lost a contest with Kakashi, and proceeded to do so upon losing, even though people eventually stopped paying attention. He also doesn\'t hesitate to do things he doesn\'t enjoy or that others might find embarrassing if it means his own self-improvement, as seen with his belief that one cannot dislike food regardless of its ingredients or taste. In addition, Guy values his youth to a great degree and dislikes the idea that he may not be as young as he once was. To help remedy this problem he spends large amounts of time with his younger teammates, hoping to acquire some of their youthful properties. Likewise, he often refers to himself as \"Konoha\'s Prideful Green Beast\".\n \n Guy is the self-proclaimed rival of Kakashi Hatake. Kakashi, however, is indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys Guy to no end. Kakashi also seems to have a habit of unintentionally ignoring Guy when Guy is lecturing him, which usually results in Guy asking himselif why Kakashi \"has to act so cool\".

Later she, along with nine others, were branded with Orochimaru\'s first ten samples of the Cursed Seal of Heaven. Of the ten, Anko was the only one to survive, establishing the one-in-ten chance of surviving the Cursed Seal. Orochimaru supposedly rejected Anko as a subordinate, believing she did not have the lust for power or vengeance needed to fuel the Cursed Seal. Orochimaru lost interest in her, though he believed there was some value in letting her live.

This probably comes from her time with Orochimaru. She regularly makes sure to have at least basic knowledge of the landscape for which her next mission will take place.\n \n As shown in flashbacks during the Land of Sea arc, Anko greatly admired Orochimaru while under his tutelage, seeing him as a role model and was inspired to be more like him. After being branded by Orochimaru with the Curse Seal, Anko became enraged and carried a deep loathing for her former teacher.

Such comparisons are common throughout the first part of the series, and in the second as well. The second part of the series reveals that Naruto is his son, hence the comparisons, born to Kushina Uzumaki. In his youth Minato, along with two other unknown Genin, was a student of Jiraiya. Prior to becoming Hokage, he was also the sensei of Kakashi Hatake, Obito Uchiha, and Rin Nohara.\n Minato is said to be one of the greatest ninja Konoha has ever produced, with natural talent that had not been seen in many years. He specializes in using the Hiraishin no Jutsu, a technique the Second Hokage, Tobirama created, which essentially allowed him to teleport to any location with the use of a special seal. By attaching the seal to a kunai or an enemy, Minato could teleport to the location of the seal unnoticed, allowing him to wipe out nearby opponents almost instantly. This ability led to his title as \"Konoha\'s Yellow Flash,\" and it caused him to be seen as so dangerous that a flee-on-sight order was given in regards to him during the Third Ninja War. He also created the Rasengan, a technique that does not rely on hand seals but instead uses a concentration of spinning chakra in one\'s palm that causes immense damage to its victim on contact. Later in the series it is revealed that technique is actually incomplete. Minato had planned to add his own nature manipulation training to the Rasengan, making it even more powerful, but could not manage to prior to his death.\n \n Later during the war he is resurrected by Orochimaru with Edo Tensei alongside all the deceased Hokage on Sasuke\'s demand. After Sasuke chooses to protect the village, he goes and joins the battlefield along with his fellow Hokage to help the Allied Shinobi Forces in their fight with the Juubi.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 17543,   ["firstname"] = "Nan", ["lastname"] = "Nan",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Nan", }, ["description"] = "Nan was a villager in a small village in the demilitarized zone of the Rice Field Country.

This is partly due to him seeking paths of least resistance, as he often chooses to do things he would otherwise not do if people nag him enough. In his free time he typically takes naps, watches clouds, and plays strategy games such as Shogi and Go. When put into a situation where he potentially needs to put effort into something, he attempts to try to find a way to avoid it such as forfeiting a battle or by pretending to be preoccupied with something else. In the instances where he can not avoid these situations, Shikamaru tends to remark \"how troublesome.\"\n \n Despite his lazy tendencies, Shikamaru is extremely intelligent. His teacher, Asuma, found Shikamaru to have an IQ of over 200, and learned that Shikamaru\'s poor grades were a result of him finding lifting a pencil to be too much work for him. Nevertheless, Shikamaru works very well with his teammates, as their fathers were teamed together in their youth. Of his teammates, Shikamaru is closest with Chouji, who repays Shikamaru\'s confidence in him with unyielding loyalty. Shikamaru also has a strong bond with Asuma, often spending time with him playing strategy games. After Asuma\'s death, he even vows to protect Asuma and Kurenai\'s unborn child for his teacher\'s sake. Shikamaru has stated that he will make the child his apprentice someday.\n \n One of Shikamaru\'s more distinctive characteristics is that he finds all women to be bossy and \"a pain.\" Contrary to this opinion, he has expressed a notably mature interest in marriage and raising a family with a son and daughter. Ironically, Shikamaru seems to constantly find himself surrounded by the very same strong-willed and bossy women he dislikes. In addition to his own mother, and being surrounded by bossy females, he usually ends up fighting against such women. Shikamaru has had a number of his appearances coincide with those of Temari. When they make their Part II debut together, Naruto Uzumaki asks if they are on a date, though both Shikamaru and Temari state that this is not the case.\n \n When the need arises, Shikamaru is quick to abandon his lazy nature and act appropriately to complete a mission or save his teammates. Using his Shadow Imitation Technique, the signature technique of his clan, he can capture the shadow of an opponent to either keep them immobilized or force them to mimic his movements. This ability causes Shikamaru to frequently take the task of stalling enemies so that his comrades can get to safety or to simply buy time. Although this role puts him in a dangerous position once he can no longer stall the opponent, Shikamaru is willing to serve it, feeling that sacrificing his life to ensure the safety of his friends is worth it. He then considers every element that is relevant to the situation at hand and analyzes the information to its fullest, planning out a battle ten moves in advance and devising over a hundred strategies to use against an opponent. This combination of intelligence and dedication to his teammates causes Shikamaru to become the first of the primary Konoha Genin to advance to the rank of Chunin.\n \n Once becoming a Chunin, Shikamaru\'s father teaches him how to use his shadow technique more effectively, by using it to choke an opponent. This more interactive capability with his shadow is put to great use over the timeskip, and by Part II Shikamaru becomes proficient at using multiple shadow-based techniques at once. He is also able to manipulate his shadow to lift from the ground and either grab or throw weapons simply by utilizing an opponent\'s shadow for the same purpose. After he comes into the possession of Asuma\'s brass knuckles, Shikamaru learns to channel his shadow into them, using them to immobilize opponents by throwing them at an opponent\'s shadow to capture them and save himself the energy.\n \n Shikamaru goes to the Chunin Exams without a particular objective, not caring if he becomes a Chunin or not. In the finals he fights Temari, and would\'ve won, but he decided to forfeit. During the invasion of Konoha, Shikamaru helps Naruto and Sakura to find Sasuke by staying behind and creating a diversionary ambush against the Sound Ninja who were pursuing them. Even though he forfeited the match, he was still promoted to Chunin, mostly because of his incredible way of thinking displayed throughout it. As a result of his early advance to the rank of Chunin, Shikamaru plays a considerably more active role in the plot than most members of the Konoha 11, albeit more indirectly than the primary cast. His first assignment as a Chunin is to assemble a team to retrieve Sasuke Uchiha, who has betrayed Konoha in search for Orochimaru to gain greater power. This forces Shikamaru\'s team to defeat Sasuke\'s escorts, the Sound Four. While his teammates defeat their enemies, Sasuke is able to escape, despite their best efforts.\n \n In Part II, Shikamaru is assigned to track down two members of Akatsuki. While he and his team manage to find their targets with relative ease, Akatsuki member Hidan is able to kill Asuma during the course of a battle. After Asuma\'s funeral, Shikamaru sets out with the surviving members of Team 10 and Kakashi to avenge their sensei. As his team deals with Hidan\'s partner, Shikamaru is able to defeat Hidan in memory of Asuma, and single-handedly weakens Akatsuki by one member.\n \n In chapter 649 of the manga, Shikamaru states that when Naruto becomes the next Hokage, Naruto doesn\'t have a smart brother willing to be his adviser like the first Hokage and there would be no better adviser for Naruto other than him.\n \n Years later, Shikamaru married Temari and have a son named Shikadai.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 22247,   ["firstname"] = "Nara", ["lastname"] = "Yoshino",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Yoshino  Nara", }, ["description"] = "Yoshino Nara is the mother of Shikamaru Nara and the wife of Shikaku Nara.

He is rarely seen in either manga or anime, but when he is seen, he greatly resembles his son with the exception of his more matured appearance and the few scars on his face.  Nara Shikaku is the father of Shikamaru and the husband of Yoshino, and, like his son, he was part of an Ino-Shika-Cho trio, together with Choza Akimichi and Inoichi Yamanaka. Like his son, he is the Shika in the group name. He is married to Yoshino Nara who, as his son says, has him whipped. Despite his claim that \"a woman is always tender to the man she loves,\" his son is never convinced. As a member of the Nara clan, he raises deer, whose antlers can be used to make a medicine which halts the destructive effects of the Akimichi clan\'s three colored pills. Since his son became a Chunin, Shikaku has taken a great interest in Shikamaru\'s training as he knows his son has much greater potential than he gives himself credit, regularly playing him at shogi to further refine his son\'s intellect and teaching him more of their clan\'s secret techniques. He is probably the most skilled strategist and shogi player in all of Konoha, he beats Shikamaru on a regular basis. \n When he is first seen, he is portrayed as a bit of an alcoholic, and at times uses some of Shikamaru\'s catchphrases (\"What a drag\" in English, \"How troublesome\" in Japanese). Like his son, he thinks that women should be tender and sweet, but as his son says, his wife has him whipped. Also like his son, he is a very lazy person, but he is also quite caring, and is ready to jump into action when needed. Unlike his son, his resolve is much stronger, as even during the most depressing or dangerous of situations, he has shown to maintain great determination and understanding as shown from how he has repeatedly helped his son regain his sense of worth. He also seems to be very smart as he has defeated Shikamaru in shogi. \n \n Like his son, and the rest of his clan, Shikaku uses a special secret clan type of Jutsu, that utilizes the manipulation of shadows in various combatable ways. Although he has only been seen in combat once, as the head of his respective clan, it is highly presumed that he has mastery of his clan\'s techniques. During Orochimaru\'s invasion of Konoha, Shikaku perfectly used the Shadow Neck Bind Technique against three opponents at the same time. \n \n He has also shown on several occasions to be a very intelligent man, repeatedly giving insightly words of advise to his Shikamaru, as well as repeatedly beating him in shoji, strongly hinting at having an intellect that surpasses his son\'s.

He is a missing ninja from Konohagakure, who is recognised as one of the most powerful ninjas and known as one of the \"Legendary Sannin\" (Legendary Three Ninja), which was a title that was given to him and his former team mates, Jiraiya and Tsunade, by Hanz\xc5\x8d during the Second Shinobi World War. His main goals are to capture Uchiha Sasuke as his new body to gain possession of the Sharingan and to destroy Konoha.\n \n <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Background</b></div>\n \n From his childhood days Orochimaru was identified as a genius shinobi and a once-in-a-generation prodigy. His parents died when he was young and according to Jiraiya, Orochimaru\'s goals, which were quite alien to the ideals within the village, were associated with these painful memories.\n \n He was a student of the Third Hokage, who recognized Orochimaru\'s natural talent and often told Jiraiya to be more like Orochimaru. The Third was aware of a malice and a lust for power within Orochimaru, but chose to pretend not to notice and hoped that he could quell this part of Orochimaru\'s personality.\n \n Orochimaru\'s desire for power grew as the years went by. One day while visiting his parents\' grave he found the shedded skin of a white snake. As the Third Hokage explained, it was known to represent good forture and luck which inspired Orochimaru. He began to study kinjutsu (forbidden techniques) and became obsessed with learning all ninjutsu that exists in the world.\n \n After leaving Konoha, Orochimaru joined an elite criminal organisation called Akatsuki. What he did while he was a member of the organization is pretty much unknown. The only information that was revealed is that his partner was Sasori and he made an attempt to take control of Uchiha Itachi\'s body to gain the possesion of the Sharingan.\n \n \n After a failed attempt to take over Uchiha Sasuke\'s body, he was absorbed by Sasuke who didn\'t want to give himself up to a weakened Orochimaru. During Sasuke\'s later fight with Itachi, as Sasuke was too weak to suppress his chakra, he managed to escape and tried to take over his body once again, however was trapped in an inescapable dream-like realm by the legendary sword of Totsuka used by Uchiha Itachi.\n \n He was resurrected by Uchiha Sasuke during the Fourth Shinobi War, who used Anko\'s cursed seal and a piece of Kabuto\'s flesh to bring him back. After his resurrection, he reabsorbed the chackra Kabuto stole from him and revealed that he doesn\'t have enough power to take over Sasuke\'s body and has no interest in the war.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 2766,   ["firstname"] = "Pakkun", ["lastname"] = "Pakkun",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Pakkun", }, ["description"] = "Pakkun is one of Kakashi\'s summoning dogs, probably his favorite.

Run, run and cling to life.</i>\n \n Background:\n Itachi Uchiha is a missing-nin from Konohagakure, and a prominent member of Akatsuki, partnered with Kisame Hoshigaki. He is Sasuke Uchiha\'s older brother. \n \n Itachi is relatively popular among many fans of Naruto, often having ranked in the top ten in Shonen Jump magazine\'s popularity polls since his introduction. He was first ranked in the third character popularity poll ranked in 11th place. He was ranked 9th place during the fourth popularity poll, and 6th place in the fifth popularity poll. During the sixth popularity poll, he again was ranked in 11th place. In the last poll, he was ranked in 5th place.\n \n Itachi was born into the Uchiha clan and was praised by all as the best of his generation - a genius above all others. Even by the standards of the battle-adept Uchiha clan, Itachi\'s prowess far outshined all others. However, not even his family, friends, or teachers could understand him. When he was only 4, Itachi had already witnessed countless lives lost due to the Third Great Shinobi World War, which emotionally traumatized him and turned him into a pacifist. At age 7, he graduated from the Ninja Academy at the top of his class after only one year, mastered the Sharingan at age 8, passed the Chunin Exams at age 10, and became ANBU Captain at age 13. According to Madara Uchiha, Itachi also had a lover, whom he killed during the Uchiha clan massacre.\n \n He was praised highly by his father, who saw the family\'s future in Itachi, hence neglecting his other son - Itachi\'s younger brother, Sasuke. However, during this time Itachi showed great affection towards his little brother, Sasuke, and even encouraged his father to come to the Academy when Sasuke was enrolled, something their dad had otherwise forgotten, by saying that he would not go to an important mission, that would establish Itachi a place in the ANBU ranks, otherwise.\n \n When the Uchiha began planning to overthrow Konoha, Itachi, as an ANBU, was tasked with spying on the village. Knowing that a coup d\'etat would only lead to another Ninja War, Itachi chose to spy on the Uchiha instead, passing on information to the Third Hokage and the other Konoha elders. After this he began to act strangely, not attending the clan meetings, speaking out against the clan, and becoming the prime suspect for the murder of his best friend, Shisui Uchiha. The clan lost hope in Itachi, and his father began shifting his focus to Sasuke instead. Meanwhile, the Third\'s attempts to negotiate a bloodless end to hostilities between the two parties were proving ineffective, so, against the Third\'s wishes, Danzo and the Konoha Council ordered Itachi to wipe out the Uchiha.\n \n Before the fateful night arrived, Itachi discovered the existence of Madara Uchiha, who was attempting to rekindle the flames of war in Konoha. In return for not attacking Konoha, Itachi offered to help Madara claim vengeance against the Uchiha for turning their backs on him decades earlier. Madara agreed. Itachi slaughtered his entire clan overnight, sparing only Sasuke. Sasuke\'s life was worth more than the village to Itachi, and he could not follow through with the orders to kill him as well. Instead, he made himself out as a villain, who had killed their innocent family only to test his abilities. By doing so, he wanted Sasuke to take vengeance on him and become a hero to Konoha, thus redeeming the Uchiha name. He tortured Sasuke with his Mangekyo Sharingan, and encouraged him to become strong enough to kill him and avenge their family. Hoping that his beloved little brother would someday be powerful enough to kill him, Itachi left the village as a traitor.\n \n Knowing that Konoha would still want to eliminate Sasuke, Itachi pleaded with the Third Hokage to keep Sasuke safe. He also threatened Danzo to not harm Sasuke or risk him revealing everything he knew about Konoha\'s secrets to enemy countries. Sasuke\'s safety was therefore secured, and Itachi returned to his original plan of becoming infamous for his slaughter of the Uchiha. \n \n Itachi joined Akatsuki in order to keep an eye on the organization, along with Madara Uchiha, in case either ever acted against Konoha, all the while planning for his death at Sasuke\'s hands. While a member of Akatsuki, Itachi was approached by Orochimaru, who tried to steal his body to gain the Sharingan. Itachi trapped him in a genjutsu and severed his left hand as punishment, forcing Orochimaru to flee the organization. Sometime after joining Akatsuki, Itachi later helped recruit Deidara, Orochimaru\'s replacement, by beating him in battle, after which Deidara swore vengeance again.\n Personality:\n Ever since his first appearance, Itachi had always been mysterious, and had acted as though he was hiding his true self. While flashbacks to his past showed that he was a compassionate brother and person, his later acts and claims made it seem that this was mostly just an act. But, surprisingly, he genuinely was the compassionate brother he had once claimed to be, although he hid this from the rest of the Akatsuki to protect Sasuke.\n As a member of Akatsuki, he possessed incredible self-control of his emotions. He constantly displayed an emotionless personality. He only showed surprise when opponents proved more powerful or skilled than he had expected, and even then he didn\'t lose his composure. He did not possess any arrogance, and fully justified any statements he made about his power, even complimenting his opponents at times on their abilities.\n \n In addition to being an extremely powerful ninja, Itachi had equally impressive intelligence, and was shown to be very wise. He was exceedingly sharp and observant to any situation at hand, as he was rarely surprised or caught off guard. He also displayed great intuition, as he was almost never deceived and even then almost instantly realized the truth. Despite his status as a wanted criminal, and having murdered a significant portion of his family, Itachi took no enjoyment in violence or combat, instead preferring to avoid battle or, if this was not possible, end it as quickly as he could.\n \n Itachi\'s only initial interest was in Akatsuki\'s goals, and his only loyalties appeared to be to the organization and its members, seeming to put the organization\'s success and secrecy before everything else. As such, Itachi got along with his partner, Kisame, much better than most other Akatsuki members did with their own partners. Kisame appeared to have a deep loyalty to Itachi, immediately doing as he instructed and constantly looking out for his well-being. Itachi treated all of his fellow Akatsuki members to this same, more respectful personality, although his courtesy was rarely returned by the other members.\n \n However, when he was in a genjutsu duel during his fight with Sasuke, he cruelly claimed he\'d only let Sasuke live so that he could take Sasuke\'s eyes and obtain his own Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, after which he then claimed the Uchiha clan had been nothing but tainted and evil, since many members would kill their friends to gain the Mangekyo Sharingan, and would take another Uchiha\'s eyes to make its power permanent. Once the genjutsu was released, he called it his true self, implying his calm, emotionless personality was also a facade. This persona was later revealed to be only an act to ensure that he would die by Sasuke\'s hands, his love for his younger brother being the fundamental aspect of his personality. \n Despite his status as an infamous shinobi, his appearance was not the most intimidating, apart from the intensity of his eyes. While living in Konoha, he would regularly have a gentle and caring look in his eyes, especially directed towards his younger brother. After joining Akatsuki, he would regularly have a stern look to them. He was a fairly tall shinobi, whose basic appearance was very much like the rest of his clan.\n \n He, like all members of his clan, possessed dark grey eyes, and also had black hair that hung near his cheeks to frame his face. He also had the addition of a long ponytail in the back of his hair (which he obscured with his Akatsuki cloak after joining the organization). Being brothers, Itachi and Sasuke had a similar appearance, but with subtle differences. Itachi\'s hair color appeared slightly duller and with a softer flow to it, without the spiky style at the back. His skin was also slightly darker. Itachi\'s most distinguishing characteristics were the long pronounced creases under his eyes.\n \n When he lived in Konoha, his casual clothes would consist of a black shirt with a large Uchiha clan symbol on the back of it, and black pants with a weapons pouch strapped to them. When on duty, he would wear the traditional ANBU uniform, although he was never shown wearing a mask. As a member of Akatsuki, he wore the traditional Akatsuki cloak, and usually kept the center of it buttoned down. After his cloak was incinerated by Sasuke\'s Kirin during their fight in Part II, it was revealed that he still wore his casual clothes underneath it. Like almost all members of Akatsuki, he wore the headband of his home village, Konoha, with a line gouged through it, to symbolize his broken ties with the village (although, secretly, he was actually still loyal to his village).\n Abilities:\n Since a young age, Itachi\'s intellect and talent showed their brilliance in everything he did, as even his teachers said his progress hardly required any help. In the few battles he had been seen in since the start of the series, Itachi was shown to be an incredibly powerful ninja, and easily one of the strongest in the Naruto series, as demonstrated by his ability to easily defeat Deidara, Sasuke, Kakashi Hatake, Kurenai Yuhi and Orochimaru (twice), who themselves are considered amongst the strongest ninjas in Naruto. Being a pacifist, Itachi did not actively take part in battle, typically only acting in self-defense.\n \n Sharingan:\n Being of the Uchiha Clan, and as noted by Kakashi, Itachi was a true successor of the Sharingan Eye. From a stationary position, he would study an opponent\'s movements with his Sharingan and respond accordingly, often with a genjutsu. He could cast a genjutsu by merely pointing at or looking at someone, and could similarly turn an opponent\'s genjutsu against them with Demonic Illusion: Mirror Heaven and Earth Change. Itachi had trained so much with his eyes that he had reached the stage where he could have his Sharingan activated the entire time, with minimal drain on his chakra levels. \n \n Mangekyo Sharingan:\n Itachi possessed the Mangekyo Sharingan, which increased his already great power, and enabled him to use his most powerful techniques. With his left eye, he could use Tsukuyomi, a genjutsu that traps an opponent\'s mind in an illusionary world, torturing them for what seems like days in a matter of seconds.With his right eye he could use Amaterasu, a ninjutsu which allowed him to create a black flame that he could direct by moving his eye to burn through seemingly anything in its path, including fire itself. His final technique was Susanoo, a technique that manifested itself as a spectral being, labelled as the \"Raging God of Battle\" in the databook. It wielded the Totsuka Sword, an ethereal sword with the ability to seal anything it pierces into the gourd that serves as its hilt, and Yata\'s Mirror, a shield that can reflect any attack. Zetsu, a fellow Akatsuki member, stated that Itachi\'s mastery of the Sharingan, combined with the legendary weapons of Susanoo, made him invincible.\n \n Despite his mastery of the Mangekyo Sharingan, Itachi suffered greatly from its side effects. His eyesight would worsen after every activation of the Mangekyo Sharingan, and he would eventually go blind from its power, with his Sharingan forever sealed away. Itachi was so close to blindness that, by the time he activated Susanoo in his final fight, both Sharingan eyes had become almost blind, and had turned white. However, he was still able to perform his own F\xc5\xabinjutsu in his last moments.\n (Source: Naruto.com, Naruto Wikia)\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 21122,   ["firstname"] = "Uchiha", ["lastname"] = "Mikoto",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Mikoto  Uchiha", }, ["description"] = "Birthday: June 1 \n Mikoto Uchiha was the mother of Sasuke and Itachi.

The bulk of Kabuto\'s fighting ability lies in the medical jutsu taught to him by his adoptive father. These abilities have been further enhanced through his allegiance to Orochimaru, as he has been able to experiment on others to increase his medical knowledge. As a result, Kabuto is able to reactivate dead cells in a concentrated area and grow new ones. While he uses this ability in battle to immediately recover from attacks, it can also be used during his experiments to keep test subjects alive for much longer than is feasible. Kabuto can even temporarily reanimate a corpse for use as an ally or a decoy. During his battle with Tsunade, she remarks that his fighting and healing abilities surpass her own when she was his age. Despite his talents, Kabuto has always served others, a fate he is dissatisfied with. As such, after Orochimaru\'s defeat, Kabuto integrates his master\'s remains into his body as a means to become more powerful and to no longer be the mere tool of others. The remains have since begun trying to take over his body.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 2009,   ["firstname"] = "Yamanaka", ["lastname"] = "Ino",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Ino  Yamanaka", }, ["description"] = "<b>Personal Data:</b> <b>Birthday:</b> September 23\n <b>Horoscope:</b> Libra\n <b>Gender:</b> Female\n <b>Age:</b> 12-13 (Part I), 16 (Part II)\n <b>Height:</b> 149.3 cm (4\'89\'\')-151.2 cm (4\'96\'\') (Part I), 162.2 cm (5\'32\'\') (Part II)\n <b>Weight:</b> 38.2 kg-38.5 kg (Part I), 46 kg (Part II)\n <b>Blood Type:</b> B\n <b>Clan:</b> Yamanaka clan\n <b>Family:</b> Inoichi Yamanaka (Father)\n <b>Affiliation:</b> Konohagakure\n <b>Team:</b>\n Team Asuma\n Konoha 11\n Team Three\n Nij\xc5\xab Sh\xc5\x8dtai\n Fifth Division\n <b>Rank:</b> Genin (Part I), Ch\xc5\xabnin (Part II)\n <b>Registration ID:</b> 012604\n <b>Academy Grad.

She acted like a mentor, being tougher and more confident. Under her influence, Sakura began to develope her own identity. Though close to Ino, Sakura could not help but feel she was in her shadow and upon learning they liked the same boy, ended their friendship so that they could compete for his affection, beginning a bitter rivalry. Ino shed her tomboyish look in retaliation and was more open about her feelings towards Sasuke. The rivalry stays till the Chunin Exam. Nevertheless, they have a competitive relationship. She became somewhat superficial, thinking highly of her looks and has no problem telling people what she thinks, no matter how hurtful, such as telling Choji that he should focus more on his appearance because girls dislike overweight boys. On the surface of things, both of her teammates fit the profiles of people she wouldn\'t associate with because of her apparent shallowness, but she actually cares deeply for their well-beings and maintains a strong bond with them. It should be noted that while Ino is portrayed as shallow she came to Sakura\'s aid in the Forest of Death despite their feud. She cares very much about her friends, showing deep loyalty.\n \n As a member of the Yamanaka clan, Ino works in her family\'s flower shop and has become particularly talented in ikebana. She has been noted to be sharp upon occasion, such as noticing Asuma\'s affection for Kurenai or using chakra cleverly. The anime\'s filler arcs show that she\'s been able to find other uses for her time in the shop and can tell a person\'s profession by simply glancing at the condition of their hands. Being a Yamanaka has also shaped the mind-altering jutsu she uses. With the Mind Body Switch Technique, Ino can transfer to another\'s body and use it for a time. The anime explains her medical abilities. During the final filler arc, Ino finds herself of no use to her teammates and becomes awed of Sakura\'s skills. As such, Ino becomes Tsunade\'s second apprentice, hoping to be more useful to her friends. The anime has also shown that Ino has developed her own inner-self named \"Inner Ino\". She, along with team 10 plus Kakashi, aids in the dispersion of two of Akatsuki\'s members.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 15072,   ["firstname"] = "Yamanaka", ["lastname"] = "Inoichi",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Inoichi  Yamanaka", }, ["description"] = "Inoichi Yamanaka is a Jonin from Konohagakure, and alongside Shikaku Nara and Choza Akimichi, he is a part of the first Ino-Shika-Cho trio.  \n He is a member of the Yamanaka clan and owns the Yamanaka flower shop along with his daughter Ino Yamanaka. Inoichi is a member of the Ino-Shika-Cho trio, which consists of three Jonin from the Yamanaka clan, the Nara clan, and the Akimichi Clan, respectively.

To go with this, Zetsu seems to have a split personality, as in the Japanese version of the manga the black half of his face speaks only in Katakana while the white side uses Kanji and Kana, and in the English episodes the black side has a different voice actor than the white side. The two halves also converse with each other, and occasionally differ in opinion (the black half is more serious and intelligent while the white half is carefree and easygoing).
