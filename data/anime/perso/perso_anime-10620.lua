Also known as Yuki (\xe3\x83\xa6\xe3\x83\x83\xe3\x82\xad\xe3\x83\xbc, Yukk\xc4\xab), he is a 14 year old middle schooler who is a rather quiet boy with an anti-social behavior who doesn\'t talk much. He mostly sees things around him as a bystander and writes it down in his cell phone diary. Yuki becomes involved in the Diary Game when to his shock that Deus, a god-like being whom he thought was an imaginary friend turns out to be real, selects him as one of twelve contestants in a 90 day battle royale where they must kill each other using their special diaries where the last survivor becomes Deus\' new heir. Yuki\'s diary is called the Random Diary, which written from his point of view, gives a detailed explanation of his surroundings very accurately whether it be the present or the future. While versatile in any situation, the main disadvantage of the Random Diary is that it doesn\'t tells him what is happening to himself which leaves him vulnerable. Furthermore, since the diary is written from his point of view, Yuki can be tricked into thinking something he sees is true without realizing it which is a disadvantage for other people who use the Random Diary.\n \n Unlike most of the contestants, Yuki doesn\'t want any part of the game as he just wants to live peacefully and doesn\'t want to kill anyone, but is forced to play to survive and will only kill as a last resort as he is the main target by the other diary users because Deus sees Yuki as his favorite to win. Because he is weak, in order to protect himself, he quickly makes friends and allies to help him including Yuno Gasai, a girl in his class who is madly in love with him and is another diary user. Yuki is kind person yet is naive for quickly trusting people whether they be friend or other diary users as they may have ulterior motives. The most complex relationship he has is Yuno, while Yuno is a formidable ally, her mad obsessive love for him to the point she is willing to kill or use anyone so both of them can survive scares him yet despite the many things she does that shocks him. Despite this, Yuki still relies on Yuno in order to protect himself.\n \n Originally, Yuki\'s main goal was to find a way to end the game peacefully without killing anyone but that goal quickly changes when during the middle of the game, his mother is accidentally killed by his father, who is also later killed by agents of John Bacchus, the Eleventh Diary user. Grieving over his parents death, Yuno seduces and convinces him that in order to bring his parents back to life, he should win the game and once he becomes the new God of Time and Space, he can use his divine powers to bring them back from the dead. With this new goal, Yuki becomes determined to win no matter what including lying, killing, backstabbing and destruction. His new behavior shocks his friends as his and Yuno actions cause a series of terrorist attacks across the city.\n He is named after Jupiter, the Roman god of the sky, weather and lightning.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 4963,   ["firstname"] = "Gasai", ["lastname"] = "Yuno",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Yuno \"Second", " Yunocchi\" Gasai", }, ["description"] = "Age: 14-15 Birthday: 16 November\n Height: 159 cm (5\'2\")\n Weight: 49 kg\n BWH: 74-50-73\n Affiliation: Future Diary, Yukiteru Amano\n Occupation: Future Diary Owner, Junior High School Student\n Diary number: 2\n Diary type: Yukiteru Diary\n Likes: Yukiteru Amano\n Famous quote: <i>\"I\'m crazy!? What\'s crazy is this world, that refuses to let me be with you.\"</i>\n \n Yuno Gasai is obsessively in love with Yukiteru (Yandere) as one can safely guess from just the simple name of her future diary. Yukiteru\'s condition and actions are recorded every ten minutes in her \"Yukiteru\" diary, it also provides small commentary made by Yuno in some of the entries. Its most obvious weakness is that it does not show Yuno\'s future at all&mdash;her condition, situation, or surroundings&mdash;unless it somehow involves Yuki. Working with Yukiteru\'s \"Random Diary\" diary, however, covers both of their diaries\' individual flaws; as it has been said the two make for a perfect combo.\n \n Smart, beautiful and diligent&mdash;those who don\'t truly know Gasai Yuno would simply see the model student role she plays while at school. She is secretly obsessed with Yukiteru and would do anything within her power to assist him. She can be quite clingy and is highly fond of stalking him. When obstacles arise that either endangers Yukki\'s life or threatens their relationship, her thoughts turn murderous and she lets nothing get in the way of her path. Yuno is also able to quickly analyze and adapt to unexpected situations that may arise, and she puts thoughts into action without hesitation, performing what needs to be done without ever losing her nerves. These traits make her one of the strongest players in Deus\'s game, despite having one of the weakest diaries for providing self survival aid. And while Yukiteru is credited for triggering the greatest shift in future occurrences, Yuno is the one who has created the largest influence in those events. Yuno tends to carry around a box cutter with her at all times, though she will make use of other weaponry such as kitchen knives, hatchets, etc, when required.\n \n Near the end, when Yuki and company begin to seriously question Yuno\'s motives, Aru Akise investigated the 3 nameless corpses in Yuno\'s closet. He discovered two were Yuno\'s parents, whom she had accidentally starved to death, and that the last one was a perfect DNA match to Yuno herself. While Yuki shrugged this off initially, Aru investigated further and discovered that the Yuno Gasai he knew was actually from a separate dimension that had already won Deus\' game and become god, at the price of Yuki\'s life. She then set out to the dimension where the story takes place, killing this worlds Yuno and taking her place by Yuki\'s side in her second game. Yuno kills Aru before he can specifically tell Yuki about the situation.\n \n \n After a final confrontation between herself and Mur Mur against Yuki and Ninth, she heads to a third world where she hopes to try again, trapping Yuki in an alternate reality. Yuki is able to break free and manages to save the third world\'s Yuno before first Yuno attempts to kill her. Yuki talks her down, and first Yuno commits suicide by stabbing herself in the abdomen, causing Yuki to become god.\n She is named after Juno (pronounced yu-no in Latin), the Roman goddess of Motherhood and Femininity.\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 8306,   ["firstname"] = "Akise", ["lastname"] = "Aru",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Aru \"Akki\" Akise", }, ["description"] = "Age: 14 years old  Birthday: August 17\n Occupation: Middle School Student \n Alternate Name: None \n Likes: Playing Detective \n Height: 166 cm \n Weight: 58 kg \n \n A classmate in Yukiteru\'s school, Aru Akise dreams of one day becoming the world\'s greatest detective. The student detective is able to correctly deduce the culprit behind the serial dog murders even before the police. \n \n He is mistaken for being a future diary holder due to his quick wits and superior deduction abilities. An additional evidence of his supernatural intelligence is shown through few arcs, where only Akise is able to compete against Yuno\'s analytical, deceptive mind. His physical prowess is nothing to scoff at either as he is able to overpower and out maneuver a psychotic Yuno in two encounters. \n \n His reason for involving himself with Yukiteru and the Diary affair is left vague at first. But as he participated in the investigation of the Diary Holders and worked with Masumi and Minene, and after revealing himself to be apart of Nishijima\'s plan to eliminate the 11th, Akise calls a meeting at his house and reveals his intentions of wanting Yukiteru to become god, yet stating his deep distrust of the 2nd, Yuno. \n \n In chapter 17 of Mirai Nikki, Akise admits in secret to Yuno that he likes Yukiteru beyond friendship, leading her to panic momentarily when he purposely wraps his arm around Yukiteru\'s waist to aggravate her. This might be one of the reason why Yuno is so anxious and aggravated whenever Akise is appears in front of Yukiteru. \n \n Finally, in chapter 48, Akise admits to Deus that he is in love with Yukiteru, however Deus revealed that he only made him believe he did. Akise, desperate to prove his independence from Deus\' will, claims a future diary and returns, attempting to convince Yuki that Yuno is using him. \n \n Yuno attempts to kill Akise, but his diary\'s power allows him to forsee her actions and guard against them. \n Mirai Nikki Paradox\n \n He is the main character in a spin off series (Mirai Nikki Paradox) where Murumuru accidentally destroyed Yuno from existence, meaning Yukiteru is still vulnerable from the Third. So until the damage is fixed, Aru collaborates with Murumuru and together, take the place of the First and Second. \n \n When Akise sees Yukiteru for the first time, his heart thumps, causing him to wonder out loud \"Is this love?\" leading to confusion on Murumuru\'s part. He also states that his reward for killing the Third is for Murumuru to save Yukiteru. By the end of second chapter of \"Paradox\", Murumuru suspects he is gay because of his strange actions around a recovering Yukiteru; refusing to leave his side because Yukiteru\'s just too cute, stating how he could kill all the diary users to make Yukiteru \'God\', and so on. \n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 21813,   ["firstname"] = "Amano", ["lastname"] = "Rea",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Rea  Amano", }, ["description"] = "<b>Age</b>: Unknown, Estimated 32 years old <b>Occupation</b>: Video Game Programmer\n <b>Alternate Name</b>: None\n <b>Likes</b>: Yukiteru and Yuno\'s relationship\n <b>Height</b>: 164 cm\n <b>Weight</b>: 53 kg\n \n Yukiteru\'s mother, Rea is rarely at home because of her work as a video game programmer.

Armed with the diary and her father\'s dogs, Hinata set an elaborate trap to capture Akise, using Yukiteru as bait. The Tenth was killed by Keigo. \n \n He is named after Diana &mdash;the Roman goddess of hunting. \n \n (Source: Wikipedia) \n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 21817,   ["firstname"] = "Ueshita", ["lastname"] = "Kamado",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Kamado \"Eighth\" Ueshita", }, ["description"] = "Kamado Ueshita is a large, strangely shaped woman in charge of an orphanage named \"Mothers Home\".  \n Kadado is the eighth diary owner. Kamado\'s diary seems to be in the form of a website where she can rent out blog space to others and can automatically promote its users\' rank based on the number of posts the user makes. For instance, Ouji Kousaka, in chapter twenty-five, submits enough entries to be promoted from \"commoner\" to \"apprentice diary holder\". The latter rank appears to give users the same abilities that the original diary holders possess without the drawback of the user dying if his or her diary is destroyed. The only apparent problem with this diary\'s effects is that the apprentices have to stay connected to the server, or else they will lose use of their diaries. She is currently in the process of having her orphanage about to be demolished as part of the Eleventh\'s plan. Noted by the children in her orphanage, she has no motivation to become God, where it is her \"children\" who wish to make her God so she won\'t be killed. All of her \"children\", who also each possessed an apprentice diary, are killed by Yuno during a failed attempt to kill the 11th. She is later recruited by the 11th, in hoping to use her Diary combined with the Holon III, a massive computer system for Sakurami, to turn the whole city into Apprentice Diary Holders. \n She is named after Vesta &mdash;the Roman goddess of the hearth, home, and family. \n \n (Source: Wikipedia) \n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 4966,   ["firstname"] = "Uryuu", ["lastname"] = "Minene",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Minene \"Natsuko Ooshima", " Nacchan", " Ninth\" Uryuu", }, ["description"] = "<b>Age</b>: 20s <b>Occupation</b>: International Wanted Terrorist\n <b>Likes</b>: Unknown\n <b>Height</b>: 168 cm\n <b>Weight</b>: 55 kg\n \n Minene Uryuu is a terrorist bomber. Like the Fourth, her \"Escape\" diary goes along with the type of profession she is involved in. Whenever Minene faces a dire situation, the diary will chart out the best course of actions she can take in order to get out of a tight spot. Based on the function of her diary, it might even help reduce the chances of her receiving a Dead End and it is probably one of the best diaries to have in Deus\' game of survival. The diary\'s only shortcoming is that there are some circumstances where the odds are too heavily stacked against Minene to the point where the diary won\'t be able to secure an escape route for her. \n \n An infamous atheistic terrorist, Minene is a young woman who bears a strong hatred for organized religion, particularly God. \n \n Her hatred of religion stems from her past when she and parents were traveling in a city in the Middle East but got caught in a battle, which is hinted between Israelis and Palestinians, where her parents were killed in the crossfire. Blaming God for her parents\' death, she leads a crusade of destruction against those associated with God. \n \n Minene got involved in the Diary game after a failed assassination to kill a Catholic Cardinal. She tried to escape but almost fell to her death and was saved by Deus, who gave her an offer to save her if she joined his game. Minene\'s diary is the Escape Diary, which will chart out the best course of actions for her to escape whenever she finds herself in a dangerous situation. While it means she can escape anything, it is not perfect as the diary can only tell her how to escape if there are favorably conditions that allow her any chance to escape. \n \n Originally, she wants to win the game to destroy religion worldwide but later mellows out after befriending Yuki and his friends. While she began as an antagonist against Yuki, she later became his ally, becoming a big sister figure to him and both of them hold no animosity with each other despite Minene was responsible for the destruction and deaths at his school and Yuki was the one who blinded her left eye. She shares an interesting relationship with Masumi Nishijima of the police whom she met during her failed assassination of the Cardinal. While she constantly dismisses all of his attempts to get to know her, she finally relents and eventually falls in love with Masumi. \n \n In the anime, during the last episode it was shown that Minene, from the second world, and Masumi, from the third world live together and have two children. Third world Minene is still a terrorist. \n She is named after Minerva &mdash; the Roman goddess of wisdom, commerce, weaving, crafts and magic. \n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 73005,   ["firstname"] = "Wakaba", ["lastname"] = "Moe",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Moe  Wakaba", }, ["description"] = "Moe Wakaba is a minor character who was Yukiteru Amano\'s first love interest one year prior to the series.
