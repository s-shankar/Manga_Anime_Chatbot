Mikasa shares an unbreakable bond with Eren following events in their past, and rushes to protect him whenever he is in danger. Mikasa possesses impressive fighting skill and strength even as a child.\n \n As a teen, Mikasa is considered a genius among all the army trainees and is incredibly skilled at combat and agility. She constantly worries for Eren\'s well-being and lives to protect him.\n \n When Mikasa was younger, her parents were murdered and she was taken hostage to be sold into slavery. Eren managed to find her and killed two of the three kidnappers by catching them off guard, despite only being a child. The third kidnapper discovered the scene and began strangling Eren while holding him in the air. Mikasa, trembling, grabbed Eren\'s knife from the floor. In that split second, Mikasa came to terms with the cruelty of the world, gaining perfect control of her own body and using that strength to kill the kidnapper in a single strike through the heart&mdash;killing him to save Eren.\n \n In the aftermath of this trauma, Mikasa asked Dr. Jeager where she could possibly go from here. She was cold and had no place left to call home. Eren gave Mikasa his red scarf and Dr. Jeager welcomed her into their family. Because of Eren\'s heroics and this gesture, she feels she owes her life to the Jeagers.

His adoptive sister, Mikasa, notes on numerous occasions that he acts on impulse without thinking things through, and she often pulls/carries/throws him when he starts fighting with others to protect him from himself. Along with Mikasa, he tends to spend his free time with their mutual friend, Armin.\n \n His father is a doctor (whom is well respected by Hannes and potentially many more) whilst his mother is a housewife.\n \n When Eren was a child, he saved Mikasa from being sold off when a visit to her home with his father. Three men&mdash;killers of her parents&mdash;were in her house, and he killed two of them&mdash;one by slitting his throat and the other by charging at with a quickly assembled spear.

It\'s unknown what at this time but it turns out, because of the injection, Eren can utilize the ability to transform into a titan himself (which explains how his limbs were able to regenerate) with side effects of a high fever and massive stamina drain.\n Eren has a special titan power called the \"Co-ordinates\", by which he can direct abnormal titans to attack elsewhere.\n Note: Eren Yeager is the official English translation by Kodansha.\n \n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 84341,   ["firstname"] = "Ackerman", ["lastname"] = "Mother",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Mother  Ackerman", }, ["description"] = "Mikasa\'s mother. \n First Appearance\n Anime: Ep. 6\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 84339,   ["firstname"] = "Ackerman", ["lastname"] = "Father",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Father  Ackerman", }, ["description"] = "Mikasa\'s father. \n First Appearance\n Anime:  Ep. 6\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 84313,   ["firstname"] = "Arlert", ["lastname"] = "Grandfather",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Grandfather  Arlert", }, ["description"] = "First Appearance Anime:  Ep. 2 \"That Day\"\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 84327,   ["firstname"] = "Balto", ["lastname"] = "Balto",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Balto \"Barto", " Wald\"", }, ["description"] = "Original anime character.

The others respected him greatly, and considered him to be a natural leader suited to his dreams of joining the Military Police. Unlike those who join the Military Police for safety and privileges, his reasons of joining it were genuinely faithful. He was shown to be an excellent judge of others, recognizing Jean\'s potential as a leader and encouraging him to believe in himself. He was also shown to have a talent for preserving order among the other trainees, whether resolving arguments or keeping them calm during battle.\n \n <b>Story</b>\n Marco is first introduced during the initiation of new recruits, and is intimidated by their instructor after expressing his desire to join the Military Police. He later attempts to maintain order when the recruits question Eren about the attack on Wall Maria, hiding the others when their questions become too upsetting. During his time as a trainee, he befriends Jean Kirschtein and the two were often seen together. He seems to have been one of the only people to recognize Jean\'s potential, encouraging him to embrace his natural abilities as a leader.\n \n After the Colossal Titan attacked Trost, Marco was assigned command of the 19th Trainee Squad and ordered to support the vanguard forces. He was eventually among the trainees stranded when the retreat order was given, without enough gas to scale the Wall and escape Trost. When Mikasa and Jean rally the others into charging headquarters, which had become surrounded by Titans, Marco is quick to join them. Inside the station, he became vital in Armin\'s plan to reclaim the overun supply room and leads the main group. Armed with rifles, the recruits acted as bait and lure the seven Titans occupying the room into position. Marco managed to maintain order in the group, keeping everyone calm until they could fire and blind the attacking Titans.\n \n He is later seen among the regrouped forces, attempting to keep order when people like Dazz give into their fear. Marco did his best to comfort them and keep morale high, even when they were ordered to return to Trost. He joined the other recruits up on the Wall, acting as bait to distract the Titans from the main operation involving Eren Yeager. Later, he was among the recruits that head into the city to battle the Titans. There, he helped to rescue Jean when his gear malfunctioned and would eventually join the others in battling the Titans while Eren sealed the hole in Wall Rose. \n \n He dies during the battle for Trost.
