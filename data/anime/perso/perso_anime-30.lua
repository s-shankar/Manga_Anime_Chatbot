He is the son of Gendo and the late Yui Ikari. Abandoned by his father, Gendo, when he was a toddler, Shinji often ran away from difficult situations. As a pilot, he panics easily and reacts very poorly to unexpected events. Over time and with encouragement from Misato, he learns to be less cowardly, more outspoken, and more confident.\n \n His progress is all undone when he is forced to kill the only person who ever openly expressed love toward him. His only friends are Toji and Kensuke, but he apparently cares about Rei more than even he realizes, although everyone around him seems to think that his feelings are obvious. Despite his rapport with Rei, Asuka is a sexual presence in his life, and is ultimately shown to be a figure of great emotional importance to him as well. Though not immediately apparent, their relationship is a powerful driving force for both characters throughout the series. Their confused, back-and-forth emotional interchanges are a source of considerable guilt and tension for both parties. While Asuka is attracted to Shinji, she is afraid to admit to being dependent on anyone; so instead of expressing affection, she teases Shinji (often with sexual overtones), hoping to \"provoke\" him into initiating a closer relationship. Significantly, she gives him his first kiss (supposedly out of boredom, though the Director\'s Cut makes clear that the kiss meant a lot more to her than she lets on). However, due to his own emotional issues, Shinji is unable to recognize Asuka\'s actions for their true intent, and is only confused and hurt by her flirting mixed with abuse. \n \n Since Asuka is constantly heaping him with accusations and blame, his most natural response is to withdraw and hide himself, both emotionally and literally. To make matters worse, Asuka only finds herself more and more frustrated by Shinji\'s failure to respond to her advances, and in turn only abuses him more and more harshly, which only makes him withdraw further, thus continuing the vicious cycle. Their tense relationship reaches a breaking point toward the end of the story; when Asuka\'s stress finally causes her to degrade into a completely withdrawn state, Shinji tries to comfort her, only to be coldly rejected.\n Later on, when Asuka has further been reduced to a comatose state and Shinji has also suffered incredible mental duress, he goes to her bedside to beg for help, only to end up masturbating over her partially nude (and comatose) body. Wracked with guilt and completely lost to his own self-hatred, he enters a completely withdrawn state, not unlike Asuka\'s earlier on.\n \n Ultimately, when Shinji chooses to reject Instrumentality, he finds Asuka to be the only other person on Earth, and they painfully reconcile.\n (Source: Afufu)\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 1259,   ["firstname"] = "Katsuragi", ["lastname"] = "Misato",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Misato  Katsuragi", }, ["description"] = "Age: 29 Birthday: December 8, 1986\n Blood type: A (genotype: AO)\n Height: 163 cm\n \n Relations:\n Father: Dr. Katsuragi\n Guardian of: Shinji Ikari, Asuka Langley Soryu\n Ex-girlfriend of: Ryoji Kaji\n Friend of: Ritsuko Akagi\n Owner of: Pen Pen\n \n Misato Katsuragi is the chief operations officer at NERV, initially holding the rank of Captain (with a later promotion to Major).

Kyoko Zeppelin Souryuu committed suicide on the very day that Asuka was chosen to become an Eva pilot. On that day, Asuka promised herself that she would never cry again. This event gives her an innate hatred of dolls and all things that she perceives to be doll-like, especially Rei. Despite those feelings Asuka shows no hesitation when required to cooperate with Rei when necessary, proving her to be committed and professional regarding her duties as an Eva pilot.\n \n Asuka\'s father later remarried a woman for whom Asuka feels no affection.

On her better days, however, she can be quite cheerful and friendly.\n \n Like Shinji, Asuka also has a difficulty being close to people, except unlike Shinji, who shells himself, Asuka\'s coping mechanism is over-aggressiveness and so she unintentionally hurts people she likes, pushing them away and thus sinking further into loneliness and self resentment.

But he is not a military man, despite his professional bearing and seeming ease of command. In the director\'s cut, it is revealed that he has had some sort of training as a physician though he has either lost or never acquired a license to practice medicine. There is no indication given during the series of any romantic relationships or of any dependents. In the episode The Birth of NERV, in several flashbacks, a few of his students and the superior professor at his institute (who first suggests that he take on the young and brilliant Yui Ikari as a research assistant) suggest that he be more sociable; this hints at Fuyutsuki being a classically withdrawn academic, and possibly a life-long bachelor. Shortly after beginning his academic (and platonically affectionate and supportive) association with Yui Ikari, he was directed by his institution\'s superiors to initiate a similar arrangement with the then Gendo Rokoboungi. \n Given later revelations about apparent decades-long behind-the-scenes machinations of SEELE into all aspects of the sciences directly and indirectly involved in the subject of Instrumentality (the Dead Sea Scrolls were uncovered in 1947, so presumably the world-wide conspiracy behind SEELE\'s operations had been in existence for only slightly less time) it is safe to say that Professor Fuyutsuki had been monitored by and targeted for recruitment by SEELE early in his career. If speculations regarding Yui actually having been a junior member of SEELE through her father\'s influence are correct, then Fuyutsuki\'s association with Gendo Rokoboungi/Ikari was equally planned well in advance. His earlier introduction to Rokoboungi/Ikari by taking him on as a research assistant, bailing him out of jail, and later meeting him again after Second Impact during a research expedition to the area formerly occupied by Antarctica may be seen as steps in a testing procedure to determine his reliability, discretion and intelligence at being able to surmise SEELE\'s goals...and whether he would actually be amenable to that recruitment.\n \n Fuyutsuki\'s earlier assessment of Gendo Ikari\'s personality (in the Director\'s Cut, the subtitle during Fuyutsuki\'s recall of the initial meeting at the police station refers to Rokoboungi/Ikari as \'real bastard\') was reinforced by the Antarctic mission, during which Fuyutsuki began to suspect that the now Gendo Ikari\'s associates in SEELE may be more powerful and dangerous than he originally realized. The seed of doubt planted during that voyage led to the discovery of the true nature of the events leading up to Second Impact and SEELE\'s involvement in initiating that catastrophe.\n \n After Fuyutsuki threatened to expose Gendo to the public, regarding the massive deception concerning Second Impact, in 2003 (through his own research), Gendo Ikari led him into the GeoFront and Central Dogma and revealed to him an incomplete prototype Eva. At that point, Ikari asked Fuyutsuki to join him and \"create a new future for humankind, together with me.\" Fuyutsuki accepted this, and started to help Gendo. Whether this agreement was entirely out of idealism or more from self-preservation is not made clear. In the movie The End of Evangelion it is mentioned that SEELE had threatened Fuyutsuki with being \'disappeared\'; the implication is that this recruitment may have been a Hobson\'s Choice.\n \n Despite Fuyutsuki\'s initial dislike of Gendo, it is clearly evident that he becomes the closest thing that Gendo has to a confidant in the series. In many episodes, Fuyutsuki may be seen as a sort of external conscience for Gendo Ikari; despite his somewhat gruff nature, Fuyutsuki is genuinely concerned for those under his commend, but having the added knowledge of SEELE\'s true goals for Instrumentality, must balance his compassion with Ikari\'s ruthlessness in pursuing both SEELE\'s agenda and Ikari\'s own hidden one of re-uniting with his discarnate Yui. Ikari\'s dependence upon Fuyutsuki as both confidant and his chief lieutenant is shown by the many times that Fuyutski takes the initiative for action without waiting for direction from Ikari.\n \n As had been mentioned and implied in the series, while obviously kindly disposed towards Yui, at all times Fuyutsuki maintained a professional demeanor towards her. It is not intimated how the Destrudo experiment that \'killed\' her and ensconced her soul into EVA Unit 01 affected him. The depth of his feelings for her, however, is revealed when immediately prior to dematerializing into LCL during Instrumentality, Fuyutsuki witnesses an image of Lilith-as-Yui which appears to float down to embrace him, comforting him in his transition to a non-corporeal state.\n \n (Source: afufu.net/freewill/)\n\n",}, {["mal_id"] = 1254,   ["firstname"] = "Horaki", ["lastname"] = "Hikari",  ["nicknames"] = {  "Hikari  Horaki", }, ["description"] = "Age: 13  Birthday: January 25, 2002\n Known Relatives: Kodama (older sister), Nozomi (younger sister)\n \n Hikari Horaki (\xe6\xb4\x9e\xe6\x9c\xa8 \xe3\x83\x92\xe3\x82\xab\xe3\x83\xaa Horaki Hikari) is the class representative of the class that Shinji and the other Eva pilots attend.

Her faith in humanity and belief that it is worth preserving and remembering stand out when compared to the more cynical characters on the rest of the cast.\n \n Yui became romantically involved with a mysterious man, several years older than herself, named Gendo Rokubungi, who was constantly the source of shady rumors  among them that Gendo had approached Yui for nothing but her talent and her affiliation with Seele. Regardless, in Yui\'s own words, he was \"quite a sweet person. It\'s just that no one knows it.\"\n \n Yui took up work at the Artificial Evolution Laboratory in Hakone, Japan, which was really a front for Seele\'s secret research organization, Gehirn. Her skills in bioengineering went towards the \"Adam Revival Project\", more commonly called \"Project E\". In 2004, Yui volunteered herself as the test subject for the Contact Experiment with the incomplete Eva-01 (a decision she had made by autumn of the previous year). She brought the 4-year-old Shinji to the site of the experiment so that she could \"show [him] the bright future\". The experiment, ostensibly, was part of Gehirn\'s research into the creation of artificial souls, but it resulted in a \"freak accident\" instead, wherein her soul was absorbed into the Eva\'s core and her body reverted to LCL. Gendo subsequently undertook a \"Salvage Operation\" that attempted to recreate Yui\'s body and fix her soul back into it, but this failed, instead resulting in the creation of the first Rei Ayanami.\n Yui\'s soul remained inside of Eva-01 throughout the series, with her son Shinji piloting it to defeat the Angels. Despite Nerv\'s extensive system of restraints, Yui\'s soul could take control of the Eva\'s body in situations where Shinji was in extreme danger. Her control manifested itself in berserk mode, a state of greatly increased power and savagery.\n \n She first moved all by herself in Episode 01, protecting Shinji from falling lights and in the following battle in Episode 02, where she took control and defeated Sachiel when Eva-01 shut down after sustaining severe damage from the Angel. In Episode 16, she made contact with her son and took control of the Eva immediately before all power to the life support systems failed, breaking out of and killing the twelfth Angel, Leliel. Finally, she manifested in Episode 19 against the fourteenth Angel, Zeruel. This time, in addition to taking control over the Evangelion and quickly defeating the Angel, she also ingested its S&sup2; Engine Engine in the process.\n When Third Impact arrived and Rei III rejected Gendo, control of Third Impact was given to Shinji and, ultimately, Yui. After Shinji\'s rejection of The Human Instrumentality Project, Yui took the Spear of Longinus and floated out towards space, becoming an eternal testament to humanity\'s existence, as Evangelion Unit-01.\n Yui reveals to Gendo that she believes anyone can find Heaven; they must have the will to survive and they will attain happiness. This belief is passed on to Shinji, first in his return to the physical world in Episode 20, and later in his choice to be \"alive\" (existing as human in physical form with an AT Field) rather than accept Instrumentality. Yui\'s beliefs may also be exemplified in her romantic relationship with Gendo, however Gendo\'s desire to be associated with Seele raised questions concerning whether he was truly in love with Yui or whether he was using her to get closer to SEELE. The fact that his every action for the next decade was made in pursuit of reuniting with Yui suggests he was not just using her; conversely, since she kept some of her agenda secret from Gendo, she may in a sense have been using him.\n In episode 21, Yui describes Gendo as \"...quite a sweet person. It\'s just that no one knows it.\"\n Yui has her own agenda, different from Seele\'s, and ultimately different from Gendo\'s as well.
