In addition, a war between the mafia groups is getting worse. On board the Advena Avis, in 1711, alchemists are about to learn the price of immortality. Based on the award-winning light novels of the same name, Baccano! follows several events that initially seem unrelated, both in time and place, but are part of a much bigger story—one of alchemy, survival and immortality. Merging these events together are the kindhearted would-be thieves, Isaac and Miria, connecting various people, all of them with their own hidden ambitions and agendas, and creating lifelong bonds and consequences for everyone involved.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=990,  ["text"]="\n                          \n    Every so often an anime comes along that isn't afraid to challenge the conventions by which a story is told. Too often, despite being noteworthy or groundbreaking, these shows can fail due to poor animation, lackluster characters, or a marked failure in plot development. In other words, they get so caught up in being unconventional that they sacrifice the other, more important aspects.\nThankfully, Baccano! is not one of those.\nAnimation\nBaccano! maintains a very high standard of animation throughout its entirety. Brains Base made good use of color to heighten the effect of the more dramatic moments in the show. The animation quality is particularly noteworthy considering\n          \n        the fact that Brains Base is one of the smallest studios in the animating business. The fact that Brains Base managed to achieve a level of animation to match many of the larger studios and maintain that level of quality for the length the show, especially during the action sequences, is a credit to their effort and skill.\nSound\nBaccano! opens with the excellent (and very appropriate for the setting) track 'Guns N' Roses' by Paradise Lunch. The jazzy theme of the OP fits perfectly against the backdrop of 1930's America, in which the majority of the show is set. This jazz themed music continues throughout the entirety of the show and adds a certain authentic flavor which is often lacking in other shows. The only true downside to the music is the ED, which is a stereotypical J-ballad. However, this is only a small detraction from the otherwise great music though and can easily be skipped over.\nAnother area where Baccano! excelled was the voice acting. The talented VA's for each role managed to breathe life and individuality into the large and diverse cast of characters. The most singular achievement of the voice actors is that each of the characters can be easily identified by voice alone, as each actor has brought a different timbre, a different nuance, sometimes even a different accent, to each role.\nCharacters\nFrom the marvelously hilarious Isaac Dian and Miria Harvent to the psychopathic Ladd Russo, all the characters are very well designed and as unique as their voices. Isaac and Miria are without doubt the most memorable members of an excellent cast of characters. The duo effectively serve as a glue that holds the story together. They dance through the series's multiple time lines like a giddy gyroscope on acid, occasionally colliding with one of the other cast members at random (usually by fluke).\nThere is one minor downside regarding the characters. Baccano! is a 13 episode series, with a cast of approximately 12 main characters. Though they all receive a certain amount of development, some critics would argue that it is not enough. However, the quality of the overall show is of such a high value that any shortcomings in development had no impact on enjoyment.\nStory\nThe story in Baccano! is very straightforward. Usually, it is the style of in which the story is told that receives the most attention. Baccano! adopts a non-sequential storytelling style. While this may not be anything new (the TV broadcast of Haruhi and the movie Pulp Fiction did the same thing), it adds to the enjoyment by removing the need for the universally derided 'down time' episodes. Baccano! has multiple individual storylines, all of which intertwine into a larger story. At first, the events and characters may be confusing. But once you're past the initial surprise of leaping feet first into the middle of the story, you find yourself immersed in an unusual, fast-paced and entertaining style of storytelling that whets your appetite for more.\nOverall\nBaccano! contains a nice mixture of drama, action and comedy. This, coupled with some amazing characters and a good short story, makes Baccano! one of the most enjoyable romps in recent years. The absurd, comedic moments serve as a perfect counterweight to the action and tension that builds throughout the show. Nothing is too dramatic or depressing, and both the humor and the violence aren't forced. The most enjoyable thing about Baccano! is that each character's actions feel natural to that character and this comes across to the viewer in a big way.\nBaccano! is one of the rarest types of anime as it successfully merges comedy, suspense, action and even a little romance, without sacrificing animation or sound quality. It is a gem that will appeal to fans of many different genres and it is one of the few animes that can be watched again and again without suffering any loss of enjoyment.\n\nThis review is the final result of a review team composed of members from the 'Critics and Connoisseurs' club.  The team members were:\nArchaeon - Wrote the review\nLowell - Who contributed to and edited the review\nMegadedhed - Who contributed to and edited the review\nHere are their individual scorings for the show:\nCategory - Archaeon, Lowell, Megadedhed\nStory -  9, 8, 9.6\nArt -  10, 8, 9.5\nSound -  9, 9, 10\nCharacter -  10, 8 , 9.8\nEnjoyment -  10, 9, 10\nOverall - 10, 8, 9.5\nIn the club wide poll held for Baccano! it received an average overall rating of 9.03\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=427,  ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Throughout my childhood, I wasn't really much into movies or the whole moving picture theater idea when I was young. I was more into video games and playing outside. All that changed when i watched a certain movie called Reservoir Dogs. At first, I was only into it simply because of the blood and violence. But further throughout my multiple viewings, I realized that the story and acting was also a big part of my fascination to this particular film. Then a few years after that another movie created by the same person came out called Pulp Fiction. This was done  in the same\n          \n        style as his first movie but on a much bigger scale, involving so many more characters and following more stories stumbling toward one goal. During one of my multiple viewings of that movie throughout the years, i had a friend tell me to watch a movie by a man named Guy Richie named Snatch. Why am I taking the time to write 169 words about actual movies? Watch them to find out. \nStory (Outstanding)\nIt's because you see, Baccano is very heavily influenced on these western movies made in this style. From the opening theme (Snatch) to the storytelling (Pulp Fiction) to even the coolness (Reservoir Dogs/Godfather) oozes western-style. Therefore, it's practically pointless to explain the plot of the show since they show how the show ends in episode one. That's the hook, the viewer isn't supposed to understand what they are seeing at first. Instead, they are enticed to want to know how did a 'mess' such as this happen in the first place. After that giant hook of showing you how it ends, it all unravels almost perfectly into a story involving over a dozen individuals. For the most part they are all complete strangers but through a little luck, chance, and happenstance their stories will cross paths most definitely.\n...with a little anime flair of course. \nArt (Great)\nThe art is something of perfection, from the minor details in the shadowing and brutal violence left on victims, to major details like the painted streets of 1930's New York City. You can tell there was a large team summoned to make this 13 episode epic. Where it shows the best though are all the action scenes, where the movements are fast but smooth at the same time, and gun shots come complete with flash and gun smoke. Blood splatters in all different directions, teeth and bones can be torn apart and you can point them out as they're flying in the air. It's all just simply amazing. Art would be a perfect only if they wouldn't add some poorly placed 3D backgrounds in some spots, and if certain parts weren't so overly dark. The darkness ruins some of the beauty of a few scenes and its a shame since this is a show where everything it shows is a visual treat. \nSound (Outstanding)\nThe sound is second to none. The op is classic, and I love how they meld the last episode synopsis with the opening theme. But this show would definitely not be as cool without the jazz styling, piano solo's and everything else in between. Every scene has an amazing amount of environmental sounds running at the same time and definitely sets the mood. If you watch it a few times I swear you'll hear something different every time. This is easily one of the few shows best enjoyed on a good surround sound system on high. \nCharacters (Great)\nThe characters are out of this world. Some plucked off of gangster flicks, some plucked out of action flicks, and some straight out the anime stock. With a cast of characters this large, you're bound to find a favorite one or have fun pointing out what RL actors they resemble or portray. Their voice acting is also top notch, I even enjoyed the annoying characters voices as well and thats rare. The crazies were my favorite overall though, just how they managed to sound so insane without it being annoying but rather fun was rather cool. My only gripe is the 'comedy relief' of the show. Why do 'serious' shows such as this require comedy relief? Sure its fine to have to relieve the viewers from all the masochism throughout the show. But i don't think they should have given so much air time to the comic relief as they did.\nEnjoyment (Great)\nThis show is basically a 4-hour Tarantino-esque movie, if you remove the credits and extra recollections that get the viewer back on track. Overall its a perfect sized anime for a Tarantino-esque story. Any longer and the viewer will get tired of the mixed up style of story telling especially with the attention span of people these days. Think of it as 'it will get exponentially complicated if this series went to 26 episodes. Although i would be all for a brand new story if Narita Ryougo made it. But only time will tell. It would have been cooler if they kept anime without all the anime 'hoodoo' and tried to make it a serious anime. But like the Japanese say, 'It can't be helped.'\n"},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=309,  ["text"]="                          \n    Baccano! has a great reputation among many American fans, who lauded its boundless energy, larger than life characters, and unconventional narrative style. As I eventually watched it, I discovered that Baccano! indeed has all that stuff and could understand why so many people love it. And yet, curiously enough it never ascended beyond a mildly entertaining show for me. \nThe feature often mentioned first in regards of this show is its non-linear narrative, so let’s address that accordingly. I don’t find it significantly confusing, for one; while certainly disorienting at first, Baccano! is pretty easy to follow once you’ve focused on these key questions: (1)\n          \n        what’s up with some of these guys who just can’t die?; (2) what happened to the sad woman’s missing brother?; and (3) what happened on the train journey?  Thing is, there is really not much point in the non-linearity either: it’s basically nothing more than a gimmick. There’s only a single instance where it did something interesting with the structure (episode 8,  in which a certain pair of characters committed the same schtick in three different timelines and circumstances), but most of the time it simply hopped between all these small chunks of timelines going simultaneously for no good reason.  Honestly, I don’t think the show’d lose anything significant by telling its story like a normal person would, and in fact it’d probably help to cut down the momentum kills and a bit of time inevitably needed by the audience to recall what happened last in Plot/Timeline B as the show zipped back to it after some development in Plot/Timeline A and C. \n	A much bigger problem for me than that: I don’t find the characters nor the dialogue endearing at all. Once I’ve finished it, I didn’t and probably would never get the urge to re-watch Baccano! just to hang out with this bunch of characters, who are either irritating dorks, nonsensical bastards, okay-ish but ultimately forgettable, and psychopaths that the show clearly wanted us to love (it’s sort of Ryohgo Narita’s thing, as I’ve discovered later).  I really respected the huge amount of research by the show’s creators to re-create the setting and atmosphere, but as it is I just don’t have much nostalgia for Prohibition-era America, and the authenticity is dented anyway by lines of cliched shonen-esque dialogue (to be fair, I’ve watched the subbed version. As I understand it, the dubbed version is lauded as being remarkably good and more setting-appropriate, so it’s a fair possibility that there’s a tangible difference in dialogue quality and/or delivery).  \n	All that said, I’d still recognize the level of energy and playfulness that made Baccano! so popular and recommend the show to those with certain sensibilities. Fans of 1930s gangster movies might be able to appreciate the setting and atmosphere it’s trying to evoke, and lovers of long-running superhero stories would also find plenty to love, what’s with the cartoonish ultraviolence, people keep coming back from dead, and inconclusive ending. While it doesn’t amount to much in practice, I at least appreciate its explicit willingness to experiment with narrative structure and the notion of main character. \n	Just not my cup of tea, I guess.

		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=251,  ["text"]="                          \n    Baccano! is a series with a huge fanbase who see in it as a wonderful ensemble of colorful characters, complex web of interwoven plots and wonderfully jazzy soundtrack. \nIf nothing else, they’re right about that last part.\nTo the series’ credit. It’s certainly ambitious and refreshing. A story taking place in America during the Prohibition Era and juggling the stories of around a dozen different characters spread across no less than 3 separate time periods, spiced up with alchemy, magic, urban legends and immortal gangsters. Definitely something you don’t see every day. \nUltimately though, the greatest concept still needs to stellar execution to really shine. It\n          \n        needs a compelling narrative that knows where its headed and why, it needs to be inhabited by characters worth caring about and the content generated from a combination of those 2 needs to be presented in a properly thought out fashion. \n‘Baccano!’ fails miserably in those areas.\nThe first major failing is the narrative. Baccano! is a series that presents its events in a non-linear fashion while at the same time jumping between the points of view of several different characters. This is a style of narrative that some works have used to great effect. Baccano! doesn’t. There’s no rhyme or reason to the way the series juggles its narrative threads and it soon becomes obvious that the answers to the major running questions will only be answered towards the end while everything leading up to it is pure stalling. Bottom line is that Baccano! is convoluted for the sake of it rather than having a fitting thematic reason for it. \nThis is made worse by the characters. They’re all, to be blunt, horribly written one-dimensional  caricatures whose entire personality and motivations can be deduced from their first 5 seconds of screen time. A handful of them gets something resembling a back story and rather forced attempts at development but the majority of them is there to demonstrate their 1 defining quirk only to prance off again while the focus shifts to another character ad nauseam.  Worst offenders are Isaac Dian and Miria Harvent, an eccentric couple of energetic thieves whose every conversation follows the exact same pattern. Made all the worse by Miria’s awful shrieking voice. Jacuzzi Splot, a shy ‘gangster’ who cries over anything and everything, is yet another example of such a terrible character. Made worse by the fact that he’s eventually made to look ‘badass’ in a way that’s so forced it’s impossible to believe, seeing as there was no character arc building up to it. \nWhat further hurts the characters is how interchangeable many of them feel. What fundamental differences are there between Clare Stanfield, Dallas Geonard and Ladd Russo? All 3 are violent nutcases who’ll murder someone for no reason at all. What fundamental differences are there between Chane Laforet, Rachel, Lue Klein and Enis? All 4 are emotionally subdued women whose role in the story is defined by an obsession over a single guy. Isaac and Miria? For all intents and purposes, a single character. The series’ blatantly covers up a lack of depth with sheer volume.  Similarly to how the narrative constantly shifts focus to prevent viewers from realizing how bland most of the content really is.   \nThe third and final major issue with the series is the way it presents its content. Its portrayal of gangsters is so offensively glamorized that it puts ‘The Godfather’ to shame. It becomes outright laughable when the series introduces us to a character named Dallas Geonard who we’re supposed to view as a villain even though other characters acting the same are portrayed as slick badasses. Violence is used with such frivolity and frequency that it’s devoid of any narrative significance. \nIn contrast, I’ll briefly discuss a scene from the movie ‘’Pan’s Labyrinth’’. There’s a segment early on in that film where the main villain smashes a man’s face in with a wine bottle. It’s a powerful, important scene on several levels. It not only establishes both the character of the main antagonist as well as the tone of the film, it’s also shot in a chilling yet explicit manner that underlines the brutality of what is shown. \nBaccano!, by contrast, is loaded with violence that is much more extreme than what is shown in the scene I just mentioned. There’s even a scene similar to the aforementioned one where a character beats a man to death with his fists. Only in this case there’s no impact seeing as we’ve seen him commit violent acts before. And that’s not even getting into the almost comical way that it’s presented. There’s no dramatic significance to any of it due to how frivolously it’s portrayed. This is made worse by how characters will opt to use violence for the vaguest of reasons. Many characters get hurt and killed over the course of the story but there’s never a reason to care. And once again the anachronic storytelling serves as a way to cover it up.\nOne can’t deny that the series has a unique style and a refreshing setting. The soundtrack is also wonderfully jazzy while animation is very solid with a number of fun action sequences. This, however, does nothing to remedy the glaring flaws: the non-linear storytelling is a cheap gimmick, the characters obnoxious and 1-dimensional, and the glorification of gangsters is downright offensive. There are powerful stories that feature non-chronological narratives or extreme violence. But these elements alone aren’t what makes them great. When taking an unconventional approach to a story it’s imperative that you think about how to best make it work. This is something the creators of Baccano! fail to realize.\nDictionary.com defines the word ‘ruckus’ as ‘a noisy commotion’. That’s a perfect way to sum up ‘Baccano!’ (merely the Italian word for ‘ruckus’). A ruckus that attempts to pass itself off as an opera. \n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=131,  ["text"]="\n                          \n    Title: Baccano!\nNovel, Manga, Anime: Baccano! was originally a light novel series authored by Ryohgo Narita, with art done by Katsumi Enami.  The series was published by Dengeki Bunko, at it currently stands at fourteen collected volumes.  It also won the Ninth Dengeki Novel Prize.\nA manga series based on the second storyline of the novel series (basically picking up where the anime leaves off) began running in February of 2007, with story still done by Ryohgo Nartia, and art done by Ginyu Shinjin.  It is currently being published by Media Works and is running in Dengeki Comic Gao!.  At this point in\n          \n        time, it has one collected volume to its name.\nThe anime series itself was directed by Takahiro Omori (famous for directing both seasons of Jigoku Shoujo) and produced by Brains-Base (well-known for their work on KamiChu!).  The anime is thirteen episodes long and ran from July 26th to November 1st of 2007.  It has yet to be licensed Stateside.\nStory: It's really hard to describe this anime, because the plot in and of itself is  extremely complicated.  There are three storylines: one that revolves around the mafia and an elixir of immortality in 1930, one that involves a hostage situation aboard a train called the Flying Pussyfoot in 1931, and a girl's search for her missing brother in 1932.  For one episode, the show jumps back to a ship carrying alchemists headed for the New World.  Each episode contains multiple jumps from time to time, but the main focus is the Flying Pussyfoot in 1931.  And all of these plots intertwine.\nYou think that's complicated?  Add into this a cast of about twenty main characters, along with another ten side characters that are still equally important to the story, and you've got about thirty people to handle.  Initially, these characters are introduced with one-note personalities, but each and every character gets development, along with advancing the intertwining plot lines.  You are guaranteed to find at least one male and one female character that you like in the cast.\nAnd they did this all in the space of thirteen episodes.\nThere's not a lot more that I can say about the story for Baccano!.  Just my description  above should give you a sense of the epicness that the writers undertook for this. And the fact that they managed to pull it off and pull it off well is absolutely amazing, as there was plenty of chances for it to pull a Rozen Maiden and not adress anything, or a Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament and try to rush things and fall apart.  But by the end of the thirteenth episode, everything is completely settled; you will know what's going on and how everything is connected to each other.\nWARNING: There is some gore in this series (blood, limbs getting cut off, things along that line), but it's nothing compared to Elfen Lied.\nArt: Brains-Base shows the same amount of detail in this production that they did in KamiChu!, only in a different way -- each character design is different, and you can easily recognize a character when they come on screen, and this is really important, with the sheer amount of characters.  The animation is fairly-high quality, attaining Victorian Romance Emma and Elfen Lied-level beauty.\nIn short, excellent work.\nMusic: The show's set in the thirties, and appropriately, there's a lot of jazz-themed numbers for background music, all of which is fairly well done, and makes me want to find the OST.  This includes the OP, which is done by Paradise Lunch, and is pretty good, too.  The ED is the stereotypical female J-Ballad, and is really kind of a letdown.\nSeiyuu: There are a lot of new talent that was used on this show, and they all do a great job.  Sanae Kobayashi (famous for voice work on Daedalus of Ergo Proxy and Nyuu/Lucy of Elfen Lied) plays one of my favorite female characters in the show, Ennis, so that's always a nice touch.\nLength: See my rant in Story to see how amazed I am at what they were able to do and do well in the length that they were given.\nHowever, the story covered in the anime only covers the first four volumes or so of the novel.  And while the manga is covering another storyline, it would be nice to see an adaptation of the rest of the material, just to see what they can do with it.\nOverall: This anime manages and develops thirty characters in three different times/storylines that all intersect with each other, and manages to wrap it all up and do it well, all in the space of thirteen episodes.  And it's got pretty music and great seiyuu.  In short, made of bloody genius.\nThis is one of my top picks.  Go watch it.  NOW.\nStory: 10/10\nArt: 9/10\nMusic: 9/10\nSeiyuu: 9/10\nLength: 9/10\nOverall: 46/50; 92% (A)\n        "},

Is a Shounen, Supernatural, Action, Adventure, Comedy series with a very attention-grabbing and peculiar story style that&rsquo;s entertaining to watch. There&rsquo;s plenty excitement and laughs to be had however prepare to be lost, at some point, in the numerous, connected storylines. ^_^  \nBaccano! is set in 1930&rsquo;s America and revolves around different characters and their stories, which involves several unrelated plots intersecting and crossing each other. The way the series is portrayed is very interesting however first time watchers will easily get confused and lost, as it constantly switches from story to story or moves between different timelines. But for those able to\n          \n        concentrate for long periods of time will be able to handle it easily. It is then that you can truly appreciate the story for what it is.\nThe characters of are also another important element seeing how this series has a surprisingly large cast of characters, so remembering them may become a problem. However there will be some that stand out to individual viewers, be it for the character traits, personalities or eccentric behaviour (Isaac &amp; Miria). These will be the ones you&rsquo;ll enjoy.\nThe animation is superb in the way that everything and everyone moves fluidly, from their little gestures to the action sequences. There&rsquo;s also a fair bit of blood and gore, which is used appropriately and the environments including buildings look authentic. The only real downer is with the lack of detail in the character designs. The music of this series goes for the Jazz theme, which suits perfectly with time period it relates to.\nOverall Baccano! strangely felt like Quentin Tarantino&rsquo;s classic &ldquo;Pulp Fiction&rdquo; not only for its non-linear storyline but also for its ironic mix of violence and humour. The story is one of the best aspects of the series as it tells a bunch of random events that later on piece together to make a whole story. Not only that but it was incredibly enjoyable to watch the characters go through their own stories, with plenty of mafia action and hilarious comedy. Some may be turned of by the gore and the confusing aspects of the story but all in all this is a series worth checking out.\n^_^\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=57,   ["text"]="                          \n    Never before has so much madness been crammed into so short a series.\nSTORY - Surprisingly, Baccano!'s story -- or really, I should say stories -- is very straightforward. It's just takes a while to realize how simple it is because of its crazy non-linear storytelling and ridiculous onslaught of characters. Indeed, this is definitely one of those series that I'm going to have to watch a second, or even third time, in order to pick up all the connecting threads that run through the thirteen episodes. I'm a big fan of things told in a non-sequential fashion though, and while the scenes change frequently enough\n          \n        to be incredibly confusing, it serves to move things along quickly, insuring that there's rarely a dull moment (and even if there is, it won't last long at all). It definitely won't appeal to everyone, but I think it's worth it to have to rewatch something like this a few times if needed -- after all, that only means that its definitely got your attention.\nStorytelling and pacing aside though, the story itself I found to be a very exciting and unique blend of genres. Prohibition era (or approximately so) America is not a common setting for an anime, nor is an entire cast of American characters. Alchemists and the mafia don't generally mix either. It's a very eclectic bunch of subjects to say the least. Other reviews have likened Baccano! to a slew of film noir and pulp fiction films, but I've personally not seen very many of them (not because of lack of interest though) and thus can't compare very well. Still, there are similarities in style that I can pick out between the series and the few I have seen. Sin City comes to mind rather quickly, what with its multiple casts of characters and heavily exaggerated/stylized violence. \n'Baccano' has been translated into meaning 'noise' or 'commotion' in Italian, a very fitting title for this series. Dozens of perspectives spin several stories, coincidentally connected. The only real downside to this chaotic presentation is that it makes room for a lot of plotholes and unresolved subplots and subsubplots. A lot of secondary characters' stories feel unresolved or completely useless at the series' conclusion. I have mixed feelings about this mostly because the lack of a solid conclusion contributes both to a sense of realism and the way the stories are 'packaged' within the series (a newspaper company is recollecting it). It's interesting, but it definitely means you'll be left with questions. That said, I would not vote to lengthen the series. Thirteen episodes might seem a little short when there's so much going on, but it's actually the perfect length to me -- any longer and it would have felt drawn out and forced. Ironic, I suppose, but this series breaks a lot of traditional boundaries and so traditional expectations don't really apply in a lot of cases.\nAll in all though, you're definitely in for one hell of a train ride. \nCHARACTER - Oh, man, where do I start? The characters in Baccano!, more than anything else, make up a large part of the series, especially considering how closely they're all connected to the overarching story. Because of their sheer number, and because of the varied genres that have been tossed into the mix, there is an incredible range of characters. From outrageously outrageous thieves to badass mafia under-bosses to conniving, immortal old men to beautiful, mute women to traumatized little children, there is a character for everyone to take an interest in, to sympathize with, to cheer on, and to hate. Some of the characters are perfect representations of their archetypes, and others are far out in the left field. It's crazy (and most of them are crazy too).\nUnfortunately though, while almost all of the characters are fun and amusing to watch, I would venture to say that there are just too many of them. I could not count all of the 'main' characters on my ten fingers, though, of course, 'main' is difficult to define in a series such as this. But really, having more than a dozen characters running around, each with their own story, gets very confusing, very fast, especially when you factor in the arbitrary-seeming jumps in time, space, and story. Names and faces become difficult to remember, especially the tangle of mafia families and their relationships to each other. It also becomes hard to keep track of who knows who and when since groups of characters meet at different points in the timeline (you see why I say this is probably a series you'll need to watch more than once to understand all of). \nFinally, once again because of the sheer number of characters, very few of them seem to show real depth or development throughout the series. Some of them overcome obstacles or face setbacks and challenges, but their personalities and core beliefs don't change. I suppose its probably an impossible wish for a series such as this, and it may even be a distraction that would unbalance the even plain all the characters stand on, but a well-developed character is one expectation of a traditional series that I'm finding difficult to discard. But yes, since this is a rather unconventional series, its an unreasonable expectation for me to have, and I hold nothing against it.\nARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - At first glance, there's really nothing exceptional about Baccano!'s art style, but after a while, after you see a few of the gorier scenes, you kind of notice that they treat the raw violence a little different than usual. While people seem to lose limbs and body parts too easily to be realistic at times, the rendering of their injuries is incredibly sophisticated and impressive. Seriously, a severed arm never looked so good! Additionally, the backgrounds and character costumes for the entire series show demonstrate the wonderful depth of research that went into the series' creation -- New York of the early forties is wonderfully convincing with appropriate fashions adorned on characters and so on. The interiors as well are pleasingly accurate -- the insides of train cars, bars, and mansion homes are all fantastic. For an anime set in an unfamiliar time, it's really great to see that they did indeed take the time to look stuff up.\nAlso, it was really awesome seeing them weave the previous episode (or episodes) sypnosis into the series opening. It's refreshingly creative and lengthens the amount of time devoted to the actual episode, which is significant considering how much happens in every episode.\nMUSIC - I love Baccano!'s music. From the very first time I heard its opening theme, I knew it was going to be one fantastic soundtrack. Since Cowboy Bebop's foray into jazz, I don't think I've seen any other series utilize that unique music choice. The jazz in Baccano! is energetic and upbeat, perfect for the mood of the series, not to mention wonderfully appropriate for its time period and setting. Beyond the opening song, Baccano! employs some really awesome Psycho-esque violin tracks that heighten suspense and drama, not to mention thrashing pianos with tension-filled broken chords abound. The ending theme is notably different from the rest of its music being a more traditional-sounding Japanese song, but its slowed melody and contemplative mood works well as you should definitely devote some time after each episode to sorting out and processing everything you just saw.\nVOICE ACTING - With such a formidable cast, it would be incredibly difficult to have outstanding voices across the board. Still, Baccano! seems to do a pretty good job -- none of the voices are shoddy by any means, though yes, some of them are quite normal and unspectacular. (I was most impressed by the fact that none of the female characters seemed to have that characteristically annoying voice. You know what I'm talking about.) Of those that do stand out, the voices for Isaac and Miria are at the top. This is probably due in part to their incredibly eccentric personalities, but their voices just fit them perfectly. Baccano! has yet to be licensed Stateside, but I'd definitely be interested in watching the dub should one ever be produced, especially since all of the characters are indeed American.\nOVERALL - I won't lie. Baccano! presents itself as a very confusing and complex series, and at times, it can be frustrating trying to decipher what exactly was going on and to remember who the hell everyone was. Despite this though, it somehow remains very entertaining to watch. There is a perfect balance between action-packed and 'cool-down' scenes, and there is rarely a dull moment in between the crazy characters and crazy storylines. I'm going to go watch it again now."},

But we'll get around to all that immortality jazz later. A mafia turf war is raging on the mean streets of the Big Apple, a place where regular joes bounce between backdoor booze joints and the breadline. But this caper ain't about a simple gangland brawl. It's about hoods who can't seem to die proper after catching a bullet or five between the eyes. Sadistic hit-men and the dames they love, mad bombers going boom, monsters going bump and soul sucking alchemists bootlegging an elixir of\n          \n        eternal life. Just remember, Baccano! ain't about beginnings and ends. It's about the twists and turns, bub. Paths don't cross in this story - They collide. Every Dick and Jane plays the lead and it's gonna be a bumpy ride.” – The description of Baccano on the back-of-the-box set, and probably the best back-of-the-box description there’s ever been.\nA few years ago, before I became enlightened and engrossed by anime in general, I would have said that for a show or film to be good it needed to have a linear narrative that was both intriguing and well-executed, good character development, and an ending that tied everything up nicely that the audience could all understand and enjoy. Fast forward to today, and I sit here wondering how I was so foolish and simple-minded back then; ignorant of other methods that stories could be told. Overtime those beliefs I had about what fundamentally makes a show good were challenged and proven wrong as I started watching more anime, but no other anime had an influence on these thoughts more so than Baccano. Because Baccano had almost none of those initial beliefs, yet was praised by so many anime fans. So, I watched it, and what Baccano did was it took those beliefs, and shredded them till they were unrecognizable, splattering them with animated blood before burying them six feet into the ground. Yes, it is that good.\nBaccano is a 2007 anime adaptation of a series of light novels, made by Studio Brain’s Base who were behind the making for shows such as Durarara!!, Blood Lad and the Natsume’s Book of Friends series. Baccano is made up of 13 episodes (16 including the OVAs) and revolves around alchemists who have learned the secrets of and gained the power of immortality… but the show is about a New York turf war between rival Mafia families… as well as a group of madmen who hijack a train… and it also includes a girl searching for her lost brother. As you can see, Baccano is not your average run-of-the-mill anime. Baccano is made up of numerous plots that are crammed into 13 episodes and the show bounces between these different storylines taking place at different times and places. It is told in a non-sequential style and because of this, one could easily imagine this show turning out as a massive clusterfuck. Thankfully, Baccano is clearly no clusterfuck; all the individual stories told intertwine to create a larger, overarching story. And the way Baccano juggles both the characters and subplots matches the ridiculous tone and energy of each of these arcs, leaving us with an insane, mental and downright fun show that is as well-written as it is enjoyable.\nWith how much is going on in Baccano, between all the plot line the premise throws at you and the scattered timelines, it would not be difficult to see how this can make the show difficult to follow and understand or even want to give the show a try at all. However, to counteract these issues one might initially have, Baccano’s first episode is used as a guide to help viewers comprehend what the show is all about. The first episode looks at two characters who are looking at the different storylines that take place within the show, acting as both an introduction and a spoiler to each storyline as it practically tells you how each one ends. They show initially how the overarching story looks to outsiders under first impressions; a clusterfuck, full of action, black comedy and violence that are all pretty entertaining on their own, but are meant to entice one how such a clusterfuck ever happened. Looking at this deeper, the first episode is used as a means to challenge conventions through most stories are told, questioning why audiences should believe that the beginning of a story should take place at the beginning of the timeline. It is after the first episode where the show unravels the initial mess shown at first into the numerous plot threads and characters Baccano contains. And overtime, common plot threads emerge and confusing pieces to the puzzle come and fit together to tell the eccentric masterpiece that is truly what Baccano is. \nBaccano is usually known as the Pulp Fiction of anime and it is clear why. Both have non-linear narratives that exude this essence of coolness about them, all while being packed with dark humour, violence, guns, blood, wit, grit, slick dialogue and more that make these kinds of shows break the mould and stand apart from every other story told. One could think of the show as a 4-hour flick directed by Tarantino; it’s a good time. It’s filled with many references, cinematography and directing techniques you would have commonly found in the West before the turn of the millennium. In fact, Baccano overall feels more American than Japanese, and for someone like myself, who has watched many Western works throughout my life, this show is definitely one of the more relatable works in the anime industry. It’s actually surprising to me that to my knowledge the West has not even attempted to adapt Baccano into a live-action TV show or a series of films. Oh well, this is already great as it is.\nAnother great thing about Baccano it that it has great pacing throughout the entire series. No episode in this show feels like it wasted time that could have been used elsewhere more effectively or that it should not have been made in general. Everything that happens in the show is of crucial importance to the many subplots this show contains. With only 13 episodes that this show originally had to work with, the lack of filler and overall quick pace matches the overarching tone of the show and the unique style of storytelling Baccano has even further. The show is dense, yet continues to be this high-octane ball of fun that is appealing to many diverse types of anime fans. The writing continues to stay tight and fast-paced as opposed to a similar show, Durarara!!, a 24-episode TV series that attempted to recreate what Baccano brings to the table, but ultimately failed to do so due to falling apart in the second half. Baccano is initially 13 episodes long and stayed compact and intricately woven all the way through, with the show being so large and successful, that it was allowed 3 more episodes to follow up on some of the subplots. These are commonly known amongst fans as Baccano Specials, which will be brought up later.\nIf you were to ask someone who has been Baccano what the show’s biggest strengths are, they would probably tell you either it’s non-linear storytelling or cast of characters, and what a great cast this show has. You see, for a show like Baccano, a show full of stories barely connected, that jumps from story to story, it would be difficult to properly establish a main protagonist and it would not make sense to have one in this show. Baccano does away with another common element of conventional storytelling by having no proper main protagonist and instead being composed of over a dozen main characters, where each are given enough focus and development for all to be considered fully fleshed-out. Rarely any show that runs this short is able to pull of such a large cast of characters so well, but Baccano, of course, pulls it off to near perfection. Every aspect these characters have, from their personas to their dialogue are all executed exactly as needed for this show.\nThe cast is a mishmash of all kinds of personalities and tropes found throughout Western entertainment. The only characters that are able to transcend the different arcs in Baccano are Isaac and Miriah, two burglars that are in love with each other. Both are oblivious to a lot of what happens around them and are the comic relief of the series that surprisingly never got old. From the New York turf war is Firo Prochainezo, member of the Martilla family mafia who is incorrectly dubbed the main character initially, due to possessing many traits that make up your average shounen protagonist. There’s also Keith, Berga and Luck Gandor, in charge of the Gandor family mafia. Moving to the Flying Pussyfoot (the name of the train), we have Jacuzzi Splot, who leads a gang that also doubles as bootleggers with girlfriend Nice. Jacuzzi is basically a whiny bitch that develops into a likeable badass by the end. There’s Chane Laforet, a silent assassin who leads a group of men in black suits whose motives are unclear until later in the show. Ennis, a homunculus that has no freedom of thought or emotion until she begins to understand human emotion. Of course there’s Ladd Russo, over-the-top psychopathic hitman of the Russo family mafia that happens to be the common favourite character amongst many Baccano fans and it is not hard to see why, as his love for killing and monologues make him one of the more interesting personalities. There’s also Vino, an assassin who I won’t say any more about due to spoilers. There are many more characters I could mention here, but this should be enough for you to understand that this show is abundant of interesting and likeable personalities. The only character I disliked in this show was Graham Specter as he is more or less a weaker version of Ladd Russo, however he is still entertaining to watch and does become important towards the end of the OVAs so there is no really need to complain. All in all, Baccano gives every main characters depth, a back story and a little bit of flair that makes them all so great!\nBecause there are so many important characters to the overall story of Baccano, putting names to faces can be a difficult task despite the difference in character designs, especially when the show jumps around stories so often. Thankfully the show’s opening renders that problem nearly obsolete. The opening lists of the names of 17 (I think) characters that are considered main characters in the show, which is useful in remembering who some of the characters are when starting an episode. The OP also show characters together as the opening twists and turns its way using clever transition through the cast, sequenced in a way that is as fun and blood-pumping as the actual show is. The insanely catchy jazz tune that is played alongside it matches the scenes so well and makes this opening on of my favourite and one you will never want to skip. Only problem I have with it however is that it gives too much attention to characters that barely matter to the characters, whilst giving next to no introduction to other, more important characters. But other than that, it is excellent. As for the ED, it is nice to listen to but honestly you are probably going to skip it every time to get to the next episode since this show is like a drug.\nThe overall soundtrack continues the vibe the opening gives off, comprised of a number of Western-themed and jazz-inspired tracks to fit both the historical setting and the upbeat tempo the show always has. Probably the best jazz soundtrack in all of anime, second only to Cowboy Bebop. Baccano no Theme in particular is a great track on its own that is played many times throughout the anime and never got dull, being an anime OST that I believe everyone should go out of their way and listen to at some point. The sound of this show overall is just excellent, especially the English dub. Personally, I prefer dub over sub when watching, but also understand that a lot of dubs are terrible. But in the case of Baccano, it is must-watch for the same reasons that Hellsing Ultimate and Cowboy Bebop need to be watched dubbed. All the voice actors give a terrific performance that match the New York setting as well as both enhance and distinguish between the personalities of every main character in the show.\nThe animation for Baccano is like a perfect fit for this show despite being almost a decade old from the time that this is being written. Colour was used very well in this show, from the bleakness of the alley streets of New York to the bright, colourful and lively environment inside with characters as joyous as they are insane, to even the most minute of details on the faces of Ladd Russo’s victims. But the action is where the animation it at its best. Gun shots are authentic, teeth and bone break and fragments flying across the screen, character movements are fast yet fluid and blood splatter is everywhere… it’s great. While there were a couple moments where the animation was off-putting, like with a couple of 3D backgrounds and at times the scene was too dim, overall it is another part where Baccano is fantastic.\nRegarding the Baccano Specials specifically, these extra episodes picked up on some of the plot lines from the original series that, despite being wrapped up well, were not properly completed helped to further explore these stories and introduce some new characters, whilst further developing other characters that were already established. The specials did not measure up to the quality of the original TV series, with the non-linear storytelling being almost non-existent in these three episodes. However, the cast is still strong and the trouble they get into after the fallout of the TV series is still entertaining, keeping these episodes worth the watch and a nice addition to the franchise in general. These specials also show more cool interactions between characters and clues as to where the stories will go from there. Sadly, those hints are nothing but cliff-hangers as nothing from the light novels was ever animated after the Baccano Specials ended. The anime only covers 4 of the 21 released novels. But the Specials did give some resolution to the anime, conveying how the stories in this show do not necessarily end. While other shows would try and create an ending that brings closure, Baccano just throws these incredible characters into the audience’s faces that makes one want to imagine what would happen to them. While it may not be the ending that most people wanted, it is an ending that suits Baccano, complementing the blurb of this show: ”Baccano ain't about beginnings and ends. It's about the twists and turns, bub.” \nBaccano is a non-stop action thrill-ride and is a shining example of the kind of exhilarating narratives that anime is capable of. Both the plot and characters are enough to make this show stand out from the crowd, but the way it blends all the craziness that takes place throughout the show so soundly that makes Baccano one of the greats that this medium has to offer. It is a masterpiece of storytelling that proves that pure quality entertainment can be just as influential to viewers as thought-provoking shows with deep themes and messages.\n        "},

Aside from boasting no less than 18 main characters, the Pulp Fiction-esque narrative would constantly fracture and leap back and forth in time. I didn&rsquo;t like that I had to make an effort to constantly focus and be forced to remember so many names and faces; three episodes in, I was feeling frustrated and close to losing interest. Something needed to be done and in a last ditch attempt to salvage the series, it became clear I&rsquo;d have to wait it out, build up the fansubs and spend a long\n          \n        weekend working my way through each episode; allowing time to fully immerse myself in the story. And now that weekend is past; the end result is? What the hell did you expect? Awesome!\nMany desire immortality, yet the key to eternal life has forever eluded man. The story of &ldquo;Baccano!&rdquo; begins in 1711 when a group of sea-faring alchemists capture this most desired of gifts. Nearly all of them become immortal there and then, yet, as fate would have it; only one is granted the knowledge to recreate the potion. Of course, he quickly decides not to tell, wisely realising the folly in allowing such power to leak out into the public domain, but his brave decision quickly incites murder and ultimately, a struggle that&rsquo;s raged for over 200 years. We join the story as it reaches its climax during prohibition-era North America; this was the absolute height of organised crime in the US, a violent and cruel time to live, or indeed, die.\nDespite its frequent lapses into light comedy, squeamish readers should be warned that this is a deceptively violent (and often, sadistic) series. Without going into too much detail, lets just say that bones break, arms get sliced, faces explode and children are tortured. Of course, this refreshing lack of moral compunction inevitably climaxes in some breath-taking and unpredictable action scenes, including several sequences of beautifully animated hand-to-hand combat, fought on the windy carriage-roofs of a moving train. Just so you know, it turns out that knives, guns, grenades and even flame-throwers aren&rsquo;t much of a match for blood-thirsty gymnasts. &ldquo;Baccano!&rdquo; is a lot like &ldquo;Black Lagoon&rdquo;; it has that same delirious hunger for gruesome carnage.\nOn its own, the action wouldn&rsquo;t be enough, but as I&rsquo;ve already mentioned, this is hardly a conventional series. Aside from the fact that the narrative will regularly interchange years and events in a matter of seconds, many of the characters provoke empathy and romance despite having splattered the brains of an adversary all over the wall minutes earlier. I loved the playful dialogue, and the character interactions are remarkably fun and natural; you believe in their fear, sadness or anger. You can see a love affair unfolding and it&rsquo;s almost heart-breaking. By the end I was completely riveted by the story, lost in the characters.\nThere is so much to say about &ldquo;Baccano!&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll lose your concentration if I keep going. I&rsquo;ve already had to completely scrap the first version of this review since it degenerated into a bloated rant. Obviously, I absolutely loved this series, and if I ever get around to writing a review of 2007, it will easily make my top 3 of the year. The best decision I made was to push through it over a quiet weekend; as expected, the jumbled jigsaw of a plot and all those unique characters are so much easier to remember this way. The only problem is that now I&rsquo;m having trouble letting go, I&rsquo;m still stuck in the world of immortals and trying to fathom out the few remaining mysteries. Hints are made at characters and storylines beyond the anime narrative and quite frankly, I&rsquo;d die for a sequel. If you&rsquo;re yet to watch &ldquo;Baccano!&rdquo;; I envy you.\n        "},

They, without knowing it, carry only good and joy with their actions. With confidence I can say that this is one of the best, or even the best of the duets of characters in general. Even the not very interested viewer will remember this couple first. A pair of cheerful, eccentric amateur thieves, their actions and charisma will remain in the memory of anyone for a long time.\nJacuzzi Splot is a shy and polite gang leader. He is easily frightened, but he is capable of exceptional courage and leadership abilities when the situation demands it. The second most important character, in my opinion. The manner of his actions causes a lot of questions, at first it is not quite clear who he is, so he becomes even more interesting.\nFiro Prochainezo is one of the young members of the Martilo family. The boss of the family Martilo takes him to the family. Firo is a handsome and proud guy with his own principles and views of the world. He plays a very important role in the series.\nLadd Russo is a sadist, a mafia killer. At first glance it seems that Ladd is a white-haired psychopath who knows nothing but how to kill, but it's not. Ladd is very fond of Lua and expresses it through a promise to kill her, slowly, after he slay everyone else.\nAbout the characters can talk for a long time. Listed the most memorable, in my opinion characters, I want to say that the of these characters and is a small problem of the series. On the screen flashes a huge number of people, and the story is narrated as a puzzle, it is very easy to get confused, which can cause rejection to the series. Patience and memory are required from the viewer, since the whole picture of the story will only take shape in the final series.\nThe atmosphere of criminal America of the 30s, of course, is best conveyed by music and soundtracks to the series. The theme is chosen perfectly, so it's easy to choose sound compositions, they fit perfectly and reflect the entire character of the series. Noisy and rhythmic compositions perfectly express the hype around. And of course, can not do without jazz. At certain moments, on background is played by a magnificent and melodic jazz, perfectly conveying the atmosphere of the bar or restaurant. Give people mafia hats, restaurants, Thompson guns and add to it great music - the effect will be stunning.\nNo less important is animation in the series. Art made is executed at a high level and in especially important moments of the series you can see its beauty. Characters are made in an original style and each one stands out. The movements of the heroes are bright and dynamic. The surroundings are shown beautifully and reliably. The poor, criminal neighborhoods of America, bars and restaurants, mafia mansions and so on, all this causes a pleasant sensation in the viewer's soul.\nSo, what is the result? Baccano! -  is a cocktail of genres: action, fantasy, mystery, adventure. And I will not say that it's bad, everything turned out pretty well. Bright and interesting characters, a dynamic and unpredictable plot, as well as a lot of good and smart humor.\nBaccano! Definitely has its charm. This, at least, can surprise and worth your time and your viewing, you will not regret it. \n*WARNING* Here review end, and below will be a lot of spoilers. This is a brief description of the plot, perhaps someone missed something, because to understand everything is difficult enough. \nAs I understand it, the story begins on the ship, in 1711 a group of alchemists using a spell summon a demon to get the elixir of eternal life. The demon gives them it, as well as a way to stop their existence (those who have received the gift can \"devour\" each other) and gives the caster of Maiza the formula of the elixir. Maiza and most alchemists decide that what happened must remain between them, only Szilard opposes. The next night, people on board begin to disappear, devoured by Szilard, realizing that, to stay together can not, the alchemists scatter around the world.\nIn New York in November 1930, Szilard recreates the elixir, but it is stolen by Dallas Genoard. The elixir is constantly moving around the city because of Dallas, the Gandor brothers, the two eccentric thieves Isaac and Miria, Firo and the Martilo family, but almost none of them understand what it is. Szilard makes Dallas incomplete immortal (he is still getting old, but can not be killed) to get the elixir. However, the Gandoras, Firo Prochenso, Martilo, and Isaac and Miria accidentally drink an elixir. Firo falls in love with the daughter of Szilard, the homunculus Ennis. After she betrays her father and tells Firo how to defeat Szilard. The Gandors roll Dallas into cement and throw it at the bottom of the river to punish him for killing family members.\nAt the end of 1931, the Gandors struggled with the Runoratas family to manage the same area. In an attempt to resolve the situation, Luck Gandor asks his foster brother Claire Stanfield, the legendary murderer, to come to New York. Claire agrees and settles on the transcontinental train as a conductor. The train is captured simultaneously by Russo and Lemure gangs, between which there are fights. Meanwhile, the Jacuzzi Splot, and his gang is trying to protect the passengers (by the way, I still do not understand how Jacuzzi and company have appeared in a train), while Clare portrays a monster that kills train passengers. The last remaining members of the Lemures are defeated by the Jacuzzi gang. The train arrives in early 1932.\nMeanwhile, Eva Genoard is looking for her brother, Dallas, talking to Luck Gandor, who is still angry because of the murders committed by Dallas. However, later Luck secretly tells Eve where the brother is."},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=48,   ["text"]="                          \n    I’m sure most people are fully aware in this decade that Baccano is a tale of three stories told in different timelines that are told all at once through a combination of Guy Ritchie and Quentin Tarantino’s styles. Each story is largely self-contained, but some of the same characters are present in each story (ex. Isaac and Miria in the 1930 and 31 stories) and/or related to characters from a different story. As the first half of the introductory episode states, Baccano is a story with no beginnings, no endings, and no main character. It’s just pure undiluted chaos the entire way through, constantly jumping\n          \n        from different points of the three stories in order to showcase this fact. So style-wise, it works really well in showcasing that. It’s when you actually start looking at the substance that more cracks start to show in Baccano’s perfect presentation than your mother’s cooch when she hits her 50s.\nEven with Baccano’s overall message being a big “fuck you” to traditional storytelling, it is still an anime at the end of the day, and still has to following some basic rules less it turn out like a Kawamori product when he gets it in his head that he can write. My overall way of judging an anime – and other products – at the base level is the reason why I ditched the traditional scoring system: because numbers are not a good way to judge whether something successfully balances the three key aspects simply known as context, pacing, and fan-pleasing. They may seem like separate categories at first, but they affect each other in big ways when you look at them closely and it really depends on the individual product. For example, Legend of the Galactic Heroes is an anime praised as a masterpiece for its rich universe and it’s true that context-wise, few products can match it in general. The problem is that it’s a 110-episode series that is said to not get “good” until the 20-episode mark, so that’s a big mark against its pacing. However, said pacing level could potentially be counter-balanced if the fan-pleasing elements – which are partly provided by the context – are at a good level. That depends wildly on the individual and how much they like lore and space battles and such, though.\nInstead of giving my own opinion on LoGH, I’m going to move on and apply that ranking system I just described to Baccano. And even back when I adored it as a masterpiece in late 2009, I found the context kind of meh, the pacing kind of slow, and the fan-pleasing turned up way too high. That time-jumping gimmick that people love about the show so much came off less “clever” early in and more like a way to pad out the 1930 and 32 stories so that they’d end at the same time, and it doesn’t help that the 1932 story is incredibly dull on its own due to its simplicity, both in context and in violence. The fan-pleasing elements of the 1931 Flying Pussyfoot story was enough to sustain me in the past – although I always found it silly that Firo would be absent from the show for five episodes and how reliant the 1930 story was on cliffhangers that we knew the resolution of in its final stretch due to the first episode starting at the f*cking end of everything – but it doesn’t anymore. Why? Because as of present time, the 1931 story – and Baccano on the whole – comes off more to me as Saints Row The Third than Saints Row 2.\nDespite the constant craziness happening every second, it fails to distract from the fact that the Flying Pussyfoot arc is as artificially padded as its brother stories, let alone Saints Row The Third. There are too many characters involved in what is ultimately a very simplistic mess – whether they’re on the train or not – and way too much time is devoted to showcasing each and every single one’s actions without really providing “context” to the overall situation, which prevents “as much plot as you can get from a disjointed narrative” from ever progressing. No matter what style it’s going for, I like character and plot story to go hand-in-hand, ala something more in the vein of Saints Row 2 if you ignore the requirement that you have to play diversion mini-games for 20-30 minutes where you spray poo at people’s houses. Instead, I have to sit through character actions that whilst cool to see at times in their comedic violence, add f*ck all to the plot, could have easily been told through 1-2 second flashbacks, and it doesn’t help that the 1931 story has to share time with the weaker stories that it doesn’t really have much in common with. So by padding out those stories, it ends up padding its own story as well. Can you spell irony? I sure can.\nThis problem gets fixed a little in the second half when things start getting revealed, but the connection between the three timelines still remains a little too loose to really fix the feeling of “artificial padding” I get from Baccano completely. And it also doesn’t help that the show has a bad tendency to jump to the actual aftermaths of each story really early on (especially the first episode), hoping the audience would care more for the destination than the end. I wouldn’t mind so much if it wasn’t for the fact that alot of time is devoted to the aftermaths before I have any real reason to care about the aftermath. Yeah, it’s nice that Claire is hinting at a later reveal by stating to his brothers that he has a woman waiting for him, but I barely got to know the guy. Why should I care what lady he’s wooed during his exploits? I’m having enough trouble caring for out-of-nowhere scenes “during” the entire mess where the context isn’t exactly at B-level, let alone A-level.\nWhich brings me to my final blow towards this show - and the final similarity it has to Saints Row The Third – and that is this: Baccano isn’t as over-the-top as it thinks it is. It may have crazy elements and cool aesthetics, but the substance underneath all of that is predictably shallow and lacking in bite. Even the more villainous characters like Ladd Russo come off more as an anti-hero fighting off people much more evil than him, and it doesn’t help that the truly evil people are not very charismatic. Szilard sort of is, but the way he gets taken out by surprise is just pathetic. See, I would have expected a climactic fight between him and the Martillos to be full of karate moves and gunshots leading to his ultimate weakening before he gets sucked up. But no, he gets surprised by a fire and then 1-hit KOed by a boy we didn’t get much focus on. At least SR3 ended with a protagonist we’ve known for so long taking down a fighter jet with nothing but a mini-gun. Not only was Goose not an interesting villain, he just gets tripped and tackled. That’s it.\nSo at the end of the day, whilst I can still enjoy Baccano for its rampant fun tone alone, it’s nowhere near being a favorite of mine and I honestly don’t have much motivation to watch it again in the future. The way all three stories end at the same time in a way that does connect them decently is cool, but the buildup to get to there is just too much of a mixed bag for my taste. I’m not even going to bring up those epilogue episodes and how painfully anticlimactic those were in tying up loose ends, nor am I going to expand on how I think the first episode raised my expectations too high because it gave me the impression that the story would be about immortal gangsters trying to survive in the 1930s rather than their origin story, because this rant is long enough as is. It basically is an old-school anime version of Saints Row: The Third at heart in that it has a lot of things that appeal to me, but it does it at the sacrifice of slowing the plot down too much and not providing enough support towards said things to make up for that. I wouldn’t say it does it as badly as Code Geass or its other “are you not entertained? Is that not why you are here?” imitators, but that’s like praising Ted Cruz because he’s not as evil as Ted Bundy. Or is it the other way around?\nPS: Saints Row The Third doesn’t have the time-jumping gimmick, but given how you choose the order of when to do missions, it comes close enough.\n        "},

It is simultaneously infamous for its popularity and unpopularity, recieving nothing but praise from foreign fans and nothing but apathy from Japanese ones. \nA possible reason for this is that it doesn't feel like an anime.\nTo be clearer, this feels solidly American, from the jazzy soundtrack to the character designs, from the trains to the accents (in the dub, at least). As a Western viewer, even if not as an American, this feels instantly relatable.\nOf course, it helps that we get thrown straight into the action. \nSpeaking of, the first episode is something of a decoy. We immediately get two characters discussing a story who are never to be seen again (outside of the OVAs, anyway, Karyll~) and then a clusterfuck of spoilers for the next 13 episodes. Is that girl crawling up the train the rail tracer? Did that guy just lose his arm? Did someone just kill a kid? Did his fingers just..? It's messy, it's bloody, it's confusing. \nIt is hard to be original and compelling without being a mindfuck, but despite the fantasy element, Baccano! feels thoroughly grounded in reality. Perhaps it's the realistic setting; perhaps it's because the characters act so much like we would. Capturing the surprise we felt as children, watching the idle sketches in the corner of your notepad suddenly gain life as we flipped through, and audacious, like robbing a train for explosives with only your boyfriend and your two friends by your side.\nAfter the first episode the story is a non-stop ride on the Flying Pussyfoot (if you need a minute to laugh that off, take it now), along Eve's search for her missing brother (who everyone hates), the clashing of the Gandors and Runorata families in what must be the longest cardgame in history, and the quest to recreate an immortality elixir, the panacea, the ultimate goal of the alchemist. The story slips in and out among the different times with graceful ease, and a title card with the year appears for a second as a transition. Tension is continually built and smaller revelations continue to break as we see other character's points of view on different incidents, overlapping, building up and foreshadowing. \nDespite the seismometer of a plotline and the lack of clear protagonist, characterisation is never sacrificed. Characterisation comes first in this series, as everyone has their past and their reasons even if they aren't immediately apparent. Why does a crybaby like Jacuzzi have such a large tattoo on his face? Why is Chane so silent? A woman in a suit, in the thirties? And where the hell did Firo get such a snazzy hat? \nThe period setting is gloriously rendered, yet, it is not a setting that the series gloats about. There are hardly any scenes that pull back and focus on the environment as a pat on the back for all the research and effort put into recreating it. Though the series is very obviously set in the 1930s, we see it through the characters' eyes as their present - pressing, urgent, real. \nI mentioned romance before, and, without giving too much away, the affectivity of the characters throughout all this constant turmoil is never sacrificed. Firm friendships are made from chance meetings and several canon romances appear, each one uniquely forming in ways that tug upon the heartstrings and ultimately feel very real. \nOf course, I can't talk about the validity of this series without touching upon the English dub, produced by Aniplex. This is a dub that has been ranted and raved about in anime circles, and as someone who watched sub first and who genuinely prefers Japanese dubs to English ones, I was very prepared not to like it.\nWhile the Japanese dub certainly isn't bad, the addition of accents and slang added so much to the characterisation and atmosphere that it was almost like the difference between 720p and Bluray HD: like watching a slightly better, sharper series. \nHowever, this dub is no means perfect: the generic cute voice that sounds so natural in Japanese dubs came off slightly annoying with Maria (a general complaint of all English dubs, not this one in particular nor the voice actress herself), and the fact a few epic lines of Ladd's were changed. 'Thank you, fuck you, a villain has arrived' is one of my favourite things to say when entering a room, and its omission irked me a little bit - if memory serves, some other lines were changed, but it wasn't so obvious in their cases. However, I think this is a small price to pay for such perfect synching of, for a lack of a better term, the lip flaps. They were absolutely perfect, throughout it was hard to believe the animation wasn't made to fit this very dub. \nThe soundtrack, too, is absolutely top-notch. The OP is plain addictive, and while the ED is rather dull in comparison, it does grow on you. The OST throughout the series always adds to the scene and atmosphere, never feeling out of place.\nThe art in this series seems rather dark at first glance. There is not much use of bright colour in the series, but there is a deep saturation like the smog that clings to a city and fits the general air of the 1930s well. The character designs are on the realistic side and though many of the older, blonde men look alike, most characters have distinctive visual traits that set them apart and make it easier for the viewer. \nThe characters themselves are all enjoyable in their own way (except Dallas). Isaac and Miria are contenders for the most well loved character duo of all time, the most incompetant thieves ever, who spread happiness inadvertantly wherever they go. Isaac rather looks like Andy from Cowboy Bebop, don't you think? Other than Isaac and Miria, there is perpetually closed-eyed Maiza, estrogen brigade bait Firo, stoic Chane, surprisingly bishounen Luck Gandor, a guy who eats birdfood, an explosion fetishist, delicious shota, the Rail Tracer and enough psychopaths to keep you chugging along until anime does some sort of answer to Girl, Interrupted.   \nI would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys piecing together a very satisfying plot or anyone who enjoys a cast of diverse and interesting characters. This is not a story for someone who wants to switch their brain off; nor is it for anyone with an aversion to animated blood or gore. \nThis review is about the story that is Baccano! It is a story can never really end. Why? Because it's enjoyable, of course.  \n        "},

Grab your stylish hat, your most powerful gun, and employ your sixth sense (you'll need it!). What Baccano! confronts you with is exciting, fun, mildly disturbing and incredibly unique.\nYou're all ready to go? Well let me brief you first. Baccano! is a perfect blend of crime, action, comedy and the supernatural bound together in a beautifully wrapped, non-linear style of storytelling. You may be thinking. “That's a bit ambitious!” And it is! But Baccano! pulls it off so well that you'll be left wondering “what is linear even?”\nIf you're not captivated by the classy opening then the characters will surely\n          \n        enthral you. With a diverse range of fascinating personalities – from the hilariously lovable to the psychopathic, you'll be watching them on the edge of your seat. However with so many important characters in only a 13 episode series it can feel as though the development of some characters was sacrificed (Yes Chane Laforet, I'm looking at you). But don't let that deter you cause other characters are fleshed out in full, and you will love them like an ice block on a hot day.\nAdmittedly, the first few episodes of Baccano! can feel a little daunting. It has multiple storylines and you're flung head-first into the middle of all of them. But pull that magnifying glass out of your pocket and get inquisitive! Here you get to play the role of detective as you piece it all together. Don't worry, it's not hard – rather, it's rewarding and adds to your enjoyment! Embrace it.\nDespite not being a recent anime its animation holds up quite well, and is far from outdated. So don't let the fact that it isn't the newest thing stop you from giving it a bash. However a word of caution – there is a lot of blood. Like...heaps. So if you hate violence with a passion enter slowly and with caution.\nPeculiar, quirky and oddly addictive. If you're ready for some supernatural viewing (pun intended) then Baccano! is begging to be added to your 'watching' list. Consider heeding its call.\n        "},

(edit: word for this is \"sonder\")\nEveryone has their own story. Baccano is an anime that realizes that all too well and decides to puppeteer different people with different personalities, ideals and aims into making one blockbuster series that will have you throwing roses on stage as the curtain closes. It’s anime like these that I shove down people’s throats when they say it’s a medium for kids. \nSet in the 1930s Prohibition Era of America, it often shifts its focus to events that take place in New York and even unravels the mysteries that happened on a ship in 1711. The story, told through multiple points of view, revolves around the adventures and atrocities of the passengers aboard a Chicago train called the Flying Pussyfoot (yuuuup).  Keeping up with the train's name, the characters are colourful - alchemists, thieves, assassins, landlords, mobsters, immortals, chemists, monsters, delinquents, information brokers and many more fascinating characters. Sheer ruckus ensues when their security is compromised and they all set out to carry out their individual missions.  And so it begins - stories, with no clear ending or beginning and no specific protagonists, but just methodical mayhem.   \nThe story starts off by giving you a glimpse into the everyday life of (most of) the characters and it does so all at once. And by that, I mean that you have a few minutes denoted to each of them and all this information at one shot can be confusing, if not a complete turn-off. This might be the major reason for people putting down this anime as the initial three episodes are an overload of what is considered “unnecessary” information. But, here’s the thing: Don’t. \nOnce it gets going, the show effortlessly glides from one perspective to another, seldom leaving you confused, weaving order out of the initial chaos. For an anime with twelve main characters and an assortment of side characters, that’s quite an achievement. The same goes for the time/place shifts. There is just something always happening on screen, be it a funny conversation or a deadly fight. Thus, the flow while smooth for the most part might be a little jerky due to the variation in character. Seeing a gun fight being interrupted by some comic relief is mildly frustrating, but upon retrospect, it seems like the kind of thing that makes the serious scenes more intense.\nThe characters themselves are truly refreshing.  One of the most recurring characters in the show are Isaac and Miria, who are entertaining to say the least. Watching them prance about and mindlessly cosplay is hilarious. Initially frustrating, most of the characters do grow on you. We also have a Heath Ledger-esque Joker in Ladd Russo, a psychopathic hitman who's just unmissable. Just going through the varied type of characters must make you wonder how long it must’ve taken the producers to prepare the script, which happens to be very well done. Analyzing the characters (or even mentioning them!) any more would be a serious disservice for people who are reading this review without watching the show.\nBrain’s Base spared no expense while producing this show. They sent their artists to America to study the locations so that they could recreate them as realistically as possible. And it was a wonderful investment indeed as 1930s America looks exactly like it should – dusty, grand and mysterious. The backgrounds are detailed very well and buildings in different areas look completely different from each other. The characters themselves are drawn neatly with light shades of water colors. When Ladd gets angry, you can actually notice the blood rush up to his face. The emotions of all characters are done very subtly and artfully. When one of the characters breaks his hand, you can see the bone fragments in the flesh around the forearm. That’s how good the animation is.\nThe soundtrack is pretty difficult to judge. The OP, Guns N Roses, is a jazzy piece of classical American music, which is pretty fun. There's even a tiny recap squeezed in the middle of the OP. I always love it when anime mess around with the OPs. Addition of some more thematic tracks could’ve definitely kicked things up a notch. \nThere is hardly any character development, but with 12 main characters squeezed into 13 episodes, what do you expect? The cast, which up until now was an asset, turns into a liability towards the ending. It’s hard to give all of them a decent epilogue and some of your favorite characters’ futures will be left unexplored. Thankfully, the 3 episode OVA wraps things up rather neatly.\nBaccano is a bloodbath and its monstrosity rivals that of Elfen Lied. You will be subject to witnessing some horrifying and disturbing scenes such as a face thrust into the rail tracks from aboard a moving train and hot tongs being used to gouge a child’s eyes. Suffice to say, this ain't for kids.\n[ THE WRAP-UP ]\nBaccano is a 13 episode rollercoaster that will take you on the train journey of your life. The mood of the 1930s is captured perfectly and is presented in beautiful light-shaded animation that instantly transports you into the Prohibition Era America. The unique method of multiple-perspective storytelling is groundbreaking and very enchanting. The first couple of episodes are mildly infuriating because of the constant perspective shifts, however, this is all evened out in the next few episodes and you get into the thick of things really quick in this otherwise fast paced anime. There are the usual culprits, such as mood ruiners, an unsatisfactory ending (fixed in the OVA that follows) and bland soundtrack, but nothing that even comes close to ruining the overall experience. With an intricately designed plot and an intriguing set of characters, it does not fail to impress. \nMasterpiece or classic? Eh, debatable. \nGives you a rush like very few shows can? Definitely. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=35,   ["text"]="                          \n    Baccano is not only a great example of what can happen when a series is based on a series of novels, but also a refreshing reminder of why I watch anime.\nThe story is centered around a group of immortal alchemists and their involvement with the Italian-American Mafia at various points from 1930 to 1932. There are three main, separate storylines occurring in parallel, one on the streets of New York in 1930, another on board the transcontinental locomotive \"The Flying Pussyfoot\" in 1931, and finally, a third one in New York in 1932. Throughout the show, this world really comes alive, thanks to the animation,\n          \n        music, hairstyles, and clothes all contributing to a viewer's sense of what that era in American history was like.\nThe anime constantly switches from one setting to another at a moment's notice, has events occur wildly out of order, and, to add to the confusion, there are a couple dozen important characters to remember,each with their own back story. While this is completely normal for a novel, it's unusual for an anime, especially one with only 13 episodes.However, Baccano pulls it off, with everything from the art style to the opening theme making it all digestible for the viewer.\nEach character, while not particularly deep, is likable, unique, and far from predictable. They're one-dimensional, but that dimension is interesting and funny, and in several cases, even receives development during the course of the series.\nThis approach to character creation is a strength here; \"Baccano\" moves at an extremely quick, frenetic pace, with a plethora of different characters. Choosingto make all the characters interesting instead of focusing on just one,to the detriment of everyone else, was a wise move on the part of the creators.\nThe story is remarkable for its repeated, constant use of deus ex machina plot devices. In every episode, a great deal of purely accidental events occur that completely change the course of the storyline. A man attempting a magic trick involving fire accidentally burns a house down, and it just so happens to be the secret lab of a character creating the elixir of life. Two characters steal a car and decide to get away, just so happening to hit the main villain right before he can kill one of the main protagonists.\nIn fact, two of the characters, Miria Harvent and Isaac Dion, are nothing more than agents of these bizarre, accidental circumstances. At first, they only seem like comic relief, being an idiotic, overly cheerful couple that commits crimes like stealing candy bars, fancy hats, and the door of a museum.\nHowever, throughout the story, they come in contact with most of the other main characters, and through their incredibly stupid deeds,optimistic and sanguine personalities, and purely accidental physical acts, change everyone's lives for the good, defeat the bad guys, and save lives... without even realizing it.\nNormally, I'd criticize a story for so many absurd and improbable events, but since random circumstance are a central theme of Baccano and is openly acknowledged as such, it becomes both a humorous and entertaining element of the plot.\nThe art and music of the show are used to enhance and highlight the characters and story. The opening theme is a catchy blues theme that also lists all the main characters by name. Throughout the series,we hear upbeat, 30's era jazz and swing, which helps immerse the viewer in the story's environment.\nThe animation style uses very unique faces for all the main characters,making them easier to distinguish. Everything besides the character faces is drawn with very indistinct, smoky lines and a warm palette,giving one the impression of hazy Mafia backrooms, with green felt,cards, huge cigars, and Jack Daniel's whiskey.\nOverall, the pacing, humor, and action in the series is great, and the plot climaxes in the final episode, resolving most of the mysteries earlier in the series.\nNow, for me, a \"9\" means a masterpiece classic, and I think Baccano deserves this title. However, there is one problem I have with the series.\nAs good as the show was, none of the episodes in the series were spectacular.Nothing I saw mesmerized me, or made me feel I had just witnessed a work of supreme genius. It was a good story, with good characters,excellent sound and art, directed well.\nBefore the hardcore Baccano fanatics go crazy, ask yourself; what episode here stood out for you, really amazed you with its brilliance?The last episode was the most satisfying because it answered all the questions, but what episode had something unexpected, magnificent, and fantastic in it?\nNitpicking aside, Baccano is among the top 10-15 anime I've ever watched, and highly recommended to any fan of the medium. \n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=34,   ["text"]="                          \n    In anime, we should automatically celebrate when something like Baccano is tossed away. We should revel in what a delicious candy we are gorging down... but also realize that its still a candy.\nIt's Toblerone, but still just a chocolate bar (no pun intended on how the title is used in the OP)\nI've always seen the show as a tribute to gangster/crime tales; it has quite a bunch of gimmicks:\n1. A Bonnie and Clyde\n2. Multiple gangs that exist for character development/a place to rest.\n3. Uncouth scenarios\n4. Uncouth villains and hearty heroes.\n5. Intentionally incomplete ending.\nI could stop here and just call Baccano \"fanservice\", but since that word\n          \n        has been commonly used negatively to describe shows like Madoka as lazy, I will call Baccano inspiring; especially for an anime.\nTo figure out things is beyond the point. At least for the first time you watch.\nYes, first time; its highly unlikely you'll retain any information at the rate the show gives it so you'd better just find something close enough to your liking or risk ruining the show by taking notes needlessly.\nWhy is it needless? Because the show is too short for any notes to really matter; everything that has to be said, is said.\n...you just might see it differently the first time, get it?\nTo mention all the characters and how great all of them are would be a waste since none of them by themselves are that great, and collectively... well, go back to my previous point on \"what to expect for your first time\".\nThe best characters in the show are based on how they respond to the things that they are not used to, so at least characterization happens the old fashioned way (lol)\nThis makes the stand-outs a very short list, for better or worse.\nMusically and aesthetically, the show is a tad jaded with character design, but smooth in every other aspect.\nBrain Base is currently taking precedence as one of the best studios, with Baccano being the tip of the iceburg. For a mobster-esque show to be its stalwart symbol could be the shows highest compliment...\nPlenty of jazz, plenty of suspense, and loads of intensity. I gladly put chips down on there being something for everyone... but perhaps not laid out equally.\nI said before that it takes multiple viewings to get everything; a bad and good thing in Baccano's case.\nBaccano doesn't have much besides fun which congregates that much attention being channeled again. For all of its craft, to be nothing more than an incoherent blast that we can replicate over and over again, only to pick out a few more details each time, doesn't beget greatness.\nStuff like Ergo Proxy and Neon Genesis juggle quite a lot despite being vague up until the end.\nIn Baccano's end, be it the OVA ending or TV, has things settle quite finitely going against its source spirit.\nHey, I know its unusual in anime but if you're gonna set the bar, you still have to make the jump!\nSo I don't consider Baccano to be new classic as some would put it.\nIt, as its name translates, is way too much ruckus. I could compare the entire series to an extravagant party where everyone has having a rockin' good time... except you're trying to hear what everyone is saying.\nIt's nice in Baccano's case that you can whip up the party at your leisure, but man's senses can only do so much.\nTakahiro Omori did his best to translate the party from paper to... paper so that, again, is another good reason to watch.\nLetter Grading Time (LGT)\nStory: C+ (you're not watching it to comprehend)\nArt: A- (captures America smartly and smoothly)\nMusic: B+ (works well, but doesn't push itself)\nAnimation: B (a bit stiff and sore, but mans up when necessary)\nCharacters: B- (Not everyone are chess pieces and when they are, they still blend)\nEnjoyment: B (Is less boring than one would think given its atypical content, but its no Pulp Fiction)\nOverall: B (Experimental, unstable, and crazy; mission accomplished)\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=31,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    I kept putting off Bacanno because the art really shouted out to me and, as vain a conclusion as this is, I thought the art was an insight into how good the show was going to be, and therefore put it off for when I was having a bad day and just wanted a really good show to pick me up. Ufortunately Bacanno doesn't reach that excellence for me, but it certainly isn't a bad show.\nOK, starters, 1930s America. As with my Gosick review, I find it intriguing when anime teams pick pre-war 20thC as a setting for their shows as, for me, it's quite\n          \n        a boring period and, if you're not a fan of war history, the 20thC probably won't interest you until the 1970s, but I digress. It's just an intriguing setting and does have all the staples of the era:- Brooklyn gangsters, shoot-outs, drive-by's, backstabbing, blackmail etc etc. What makes it more interesting, and what gives it it's supernatural tag, is about 3 episodes in, people who are presumed dead start coming back to life... They are immortal. At the end of the show, however, it overstays its welcome as, and I'm not exaggerating here, almost all the characters are immortal, and if not immortal they will only die by old age. Yeah, becomes stale.\nI'll leave the pros to the end, so let me get this out the way - as with my most recent review, Serial Experiments Lain, the characters are a mixed bag, but unlike Serial Experiments Lain, it leans towards the bad side. The characters to me, apart from their being far too many for me to recount, is that thery're all cookie-cutter characters - the main people of the gangs act and sound so similar to the run-of-the-mill gangster, you have your shinji-esque character, your tsundere character... You name it, they're there. Except Isaac, Miriam and the psychotic dude the name of which escapes me. \nThe psychotic dude is just an ultimate bad-ass and dick, it's cliché, but you do love to hate him. His only love and want in life is to cool and, with one dodgy child-killing scene aside (not too bad however as said child is infected with this immortal blood thing), he's a joy to watch. If you like volience. I'm not a massive fan, but it's enjoyable in just how much he enjoys killing. It's an experience. \nIsaac and Miriam are the comedy-relief characters, which is why they stand out because this does come off as a serious show. They are marketed as the protagonists, but the storyline splits into three for me, so they are only protagonists of their storyline. But yeah, they're enjoyable for the obvious reason - Isaac in particular for myself did a great job of making me smirk and laugh, and while Miriam didn't do as well (ESPECIALLY when she was a GODDAMN PARROT OF EVERYTHING ISAAC SAID!) she was certainly not bad.\nOK, the massive pros - the art is absoluteley stunning, no more need be said  other than just look it at. And the music, as with the era, is all jazz. And as a massive jazz fan (along with dance/trance and heavy metal/screamo) the music makes orgasm quite a lot, especially dat opening. Aaahhhh. It's great.\nAll in all it's not a bad show but it's certainly not worth priority on anyones list, and by that I mean if you have other shows you want to watch, you'll probably enjoy yourself more watching those than watching this and thinking you could be watching whatever else is on your list. However, if you're doing any work or even writing a review, sticking on the OST would not be a bad thing at all. Overall, Bacanno gets a fair 7/10."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=30,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Baccano is Italian for ruckus, and boy, does this show live up to its name. You'll be hard pressed to find a show more crazy, chaotic, and downright entertaining than Baccano. It is very much like a Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie film, with its western settings, focus on the gritty underworld, and distinctive characters. However, it takes the characteristics of these filmmakers and dials them up tenfold, with some extreme violence and piecemeal storytelling. The result is an exercise in pure unadulterated entertainment.\nThe show follow three different plots taking place in 1930's America. One revolves round an elixir that will grant the drinker immortal\n          \n        life. Another is centered around a young lady's search for her missing delinquent brother. And the third follows the gruesome events that took place aboard the transcontinental train, The Flying Pussyfoot (yup, that's its name). Events from all three storylines are presented out of order and jumbled together. Now, it might sound like the show is a big mess, and it is confusing at first, but it is actually brilliantly constructed. It is kind of like Pulp Fiction, but taken to the extreme. The show knows just when to drop which plot point from which storyline to clarify things for the viewer, and connect the dots. It is left to the viewer to piece together this insane jigsaw puzzle. Since each story is really quite simple at its core, this piecemeal presentation makes the show much more engaging than if they were told in a straightforward manner, as it challenges the audience to use their brains while watching the mayhem unfold.\nThe out-of-order storytelling isn't the only thing Baccano has going for it, however. No, Baccano is also blessed with one of the best casts of characters in an anime ever. The cast is composed of gangsters, thieves, shady information brokers, ruthless cult members, and psychotic serial killers. Yet for being a collection of morally deplorable people, there isn't an unlikable character in the bunch. Mafioso like Firo and the Gandor brother have that certain charm to them that only slick gangsters can posses. The robber duo, Isaac and Miria, are hilarious in all their nonsensical glory. It is always fun to see the psychopath among psychopaths Ladd Russo off a few people, or even just glee over the prospect of killing. Heck, you'll even be cheering for the resident wussy, Jacuzzi Splot, by the end. This massive likability is shared by even the smallest of roles, really there isn't much more you could ask for in a cast of characters.\n...Well, you could ask for more depth. Actually, that is what the show is missing as a whole. For all their likability, none of the characters are particularly deep. Sure, they have their own feelings, desires and such, but its all pretty simplistic characterization. Likewise there isn't any huge, mind-blowing themes here either; no questioning of morality, no off-hand philosophizing. Really though, this is almost inconsequential. Baccano's goal is above all else to entertain, and it succeeds with flying colors to that end. Baccano is just as entertaining the second, third, or even forth time (or however many times you decide to watch it) around as it is the first.\nLooking at the art style, it is clear that the team behind Baccano did their research. The visuals do a great job of capturing 1930's America. From the busy city streets of New York to the lavish interior of The Flying Pussyfoot, all the backgrounds are marvelously detailed, and really give the viewer the feeling of being in the Prohibition era. The character designs do the same. The clothing they wear, and the presence of several different nationalities and races add to the settings. Another thing noteworthy is how violent the show is. Fingers are cut off, heads are blown to pieces, one character kills his victims by pushing them against the tracks as the train is moving; all of this is shown in gruesome detail The soundtrack is dominated by Jazz, one of the most prominent genres of the time, which really adds to the atmosphere. Not only that, the music near-perfectly captures the excitement of what is happening on screen. Whether it be the sound of beating drums as Ladd beats a man to death, or the blasting of trumpets as characters do battle on the roof of the train, the music enhances the experience.\nBaccano is a show that never fails to entertain. Viewers will undoubtedly be thrown off by the shows unique storytelling at first, but will be sucked into the madness. The colorful cast of characters is insanely likable and the attention to detail regarding the time period is astounding. If you are in search for high quality entertainment that is not too heavy, then you should be watching Baccano. It is one wild ride you won't be forgetting anytime soon.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=18,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    How can I start my Baccano! review?\nPerhaps the best way to start is by saying that there aren't many (good) animes out there which dare to tell its story in a different way from the usual, in which there isn't a proper protagonist. Baccano! does this and shines on that aspect.\n* Animation:\nBaccano! does well in terms of animation quality at most of the times, mainly during action and dramatic scenes. The color pattern used is well chosen because it enhances the idea of its story happening in the 1930s, you can easily realize the use of washed out colors and the predominance of brown in\n          \n        the pallete.\n* Sound:\nThe OST is well  chosen for the series, it helps to transmit the 1930s ambientation. The OP song is a unique instrumental jazz song and it's incredibly good and fits the series perfectly.\n* Characters:\nThis is surely the department where Baccano! masters completely. This show has the best cast of likable characters I've ever seen to date. On the first episode I was thinking to myself \"Whoa, there are lots of characters here, can they manage do develop them in a good pace through 13 episodes?\". Yes, they could. The characters go from the extremely funny couple Isaac and Miria to the psychopath Ladd Russo. There are also lots of interesting couples in this show.\n* Story:\nThis is where it gets \"tricky\", Baccano! doesn't follow a chronological line of events. In fact, it time lapses many times within the same episode between 1930, 1931 and 1932 events. At the beginning it's a little frustrating how you cannot understand many things if you're not paying a lot of attention, but as the anime progresses, things start to become clearer. If you like the 1930s stuff envolving mafia families, heists and conflicts, this anime is for you :)\n* Overall:\nI couldn't give Baccano! a different rate other than a 10. It has everything I could ask for: Great story, awesome ambientation, pretty good OST and the best cast of characters I have yet seen.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=29,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Anime Review: Baccano!\nEvery now and then, out of all the generic harem anime coming out, we get one anime that sticks out more than a white guy in an NWA concert. For 2007, we get Baccano! An anime that feels like it has everything an anime should have. Action, Adventure, Supernatural, Fantasy, and don't forget Comedy. With all this in mind, this anime will have you hooked all the way till the last episode.\nStory (9): Baccano has multiple individual storylines, all of which intervene into a larger story. The story is not told in order, so the first episode is actually the last episode, while\n          \n        the middle is actually the beginning, etc, etc. At first, you'll be mind fucked but that's what will get you watching an episode after an episode. The more you get into the story, the more you find out what's happening and why is it happening. The story is unique as it revolves around a train robbery not knowing there's mass murderers, bootleggers, immortals, mercenaries, and a loving couple who commit crimes on board.\nArt (9): The art is realistic and smooth, from the streets of New York to the blood squirting out of a guys face. The animation holds up for the greatness of the series, it's nothing special but it should be noted that the animation is very lively especially during the action scenes.\nSound (10): Baccano takes place in the 1930's so it would only make sense that the OP and OST is nothing but good old jazz music. The music fits perfectly with the show, you'll be bopping your head to the rhythm of the music, while watching Ladd Russo punch a guy to death. The music is excellent even if it's not my choice in music. Not only that, this has the best English dubbed I've seen next to Cowboy Bebop. The voice actors were spot on with accents from new york action flicks. Giving the dubbed version a must watch.\nCharacter (10): Without a doubt, Baccano has an outstanding cast. With this large of a cast, you're bound to hate at least one character but this was the first anime, that made me like every character including the villains. Never before in anime I've seen a psychopathic killer being my favorite character. You have your cool guys, your badass girls, a couple, and even a wimp who gets to kick ass in the end. Characters in Baccano is definitely a strong point in this series.\nEnjoyment (9): Being a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino, this anime was a pleasant treat for me. I didn't want this show to end, and when it did I was left there longing for more. This was an anime that made made me want to rush to the next episode, that kept me at the edge of my seat after ending the episode with a cliff hanger. This show will kill your boredom in a jiffy.\nOverall (9.5): Baccano! feels like a big puzzle solving it's self with every episode. As it shows a bunch of events that later on piece together to make a great story. It is incredibly enjoyable watching every character going through their own story mixed with mafia action and hilarious comedy. Baccano! should be a prime example for what an anime should be. Instead of watching today's anime for the tits and ass route, go check out Baccano for the entertainment that anime was made for.\nHey guys, this was my first review. Please feel free to give me some feed back, help would be much appreciated. Thank guys.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=29,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Story\nThe story begins with Saint Germain and Carol as our guides, two characters that give us an interesting perspective on the three unusual events that occurred in 1711, 1930, and 1931. All three incidents seem to be connected in some way and through the retelling of the exploits of the cast, Germain and Carol are able to reveal what transpired. To make the tale more gripping and insightful, the story is not told in a chronological order, but instead jumps around between the different timelines and characters, making each incident mysterious and intriguing until the very end. Doing this allows little downtime and keeps the\n          \n        audience on their toes in a manner that is sure not to disappoint.\nAnimation\nConsidering this was animated in 2007 by a smaller studio, it is done quite well and never really dips in quality. The contrast of colors used in the show, especially during the action scenes, helps maintain the exciting atmosphere while the character design ensures that every character is distinct in appearance; with every face and outfit befitting each character’s personality. Seeing how the story takes place in America instead of Japan, the staff did a fantastic job in researching American history and developing characters and backgrounds that fit into the time period seamlessly. One minor problem--although some might not think so--is the excess of blood. It seems a bit too unnatural and exaggerated at certain times, but it is a nice little addition to the gruesome ambiance the anime portrays.\nSound\nThe most memorable aspects of this anime would be the music and voice acting. Right from the start the soundtrack opens up with an appealing and relevant OP, \"Gun's&Roses\" by Paradise Lunch, that fits the early Depression Era setting well and really gets the show into the swing of things. The rest of the background music not only keeps up with the opening track’s high quality, but also sets the bar even higher by adding unique beats, superb solos, and talented vamping. The only downside to the soundtrack would be the generic Japanese ballad appointed as the ED. It isn’t terrible--in fact some might even find it appealing--but it doesn’t fit the style prevalent in the rest of the series. The voice acting is also exceptionally well done as each voice actor establishes their character with a distinguished and easily recognizable voice. This also includes the English dub version, a rare specimen of considerable quality.\nCharacters\nBaccano! has a full cast of colorful characters: gangsters that could be found in any western-style mobster movie, cynical psychopaths taken right from the noir genre, a very entertaining comic relief duo, and some normal, more relatable folks as well. Almost everyone who watches this anime will find someone they can admire, relate to, and maybe even consider putting on their favorites list. Although the show is only thirteen episodes long and contains a large cast, it still does a fine job of developing each character and making them stand out as individuals.\nEnjoyment\nThis anime really is something that can be easily enjoyed by everyone. The execution of the unconventional plot is admirable; it’s able to suck the audience in by constantly switching from one story to the next and at the same time show how each one is connected to one another. The deadpan comedic style is definitely another trait that keeps the show fresh and entertaining. It always finds the right moments to make you turn your head and laugh. Also, the mysteries behind not only the immortals but the dark and enigmatic Rail Tracer create noteworthy suspenseful and artistic moments. All in all this is hands down one of the best series released last decade; if a newcomer to the world of anime asks you for a recommendation, this should indisputably be one to mention.\nOverall\nDrama, action, mystery, comedy, and a little bit of romance--this anime has it all. The unorthodox way in which the story is told allows the viewer to observe each incident in more than one perspective; just like a puzzle, it can’t be fully understood and appreciated until it is completed. Although it may be a bit confusing for some at first, everything is well tied together by the end and gives an overall feeling of fulfillment. This along with the vibrant cast of characters, superb animation quality, and catchy soundtrack make Baccano! a must see for anyone.\nValue\nImmortality is a blessing and a curse. Almost everyone has thought about what it would be like to be immortal at one time or another. However, believing it to be a blessing or a curse is something everyone thinks differently on. The show presents it as a blessing for the most part; certain characters are able to escape death multiple times because of it. But it also shows a darker side, revealing that even if you are immortal you can still be made to suffer.\nBaccano! also shows the audience that no matter how cynical or psychopathic one is, there will always be someone else out there ready and willing to accept them for who they are. However clichéd it might be, beneath first impressions there is still a lot more to everyone in this world--no matter who they are or how they portray themselves. Anyone can fall in love and devote their life to someone. The feeling of love and the desire to protect someone dear to oneself does not require a sound mind to be experienced and if this love is ever found, one should do everything in their power to take hold of it and never let go!\n\nVIA (Value in Anime) – Restricted Division\nCkaos_Inkarnate- Writer\nSchizoidmouse- Contributor\nPhantomtigers- Contributor\nCoolMorz- Contributor\nBlack_Lighting6- Contributor\nThese are the individual scores for the anime.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=29,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    This is my first ever review.\nBefore I go into the specifics I would like to say one thing. All of these are my own beliefs and I do not expect anyone to completely agree with them or agree with them at all. But as a person who have watched almost all genre of anime, and countless number of shows (I do not really feel like adding all to my profile), I believe my opinion may help someone who has trouble deciding Baccano is worth their time or not. \nStorytelling style: \nUnlike most 12 to 16 episode shows, it tells multiple stories. You might be thinking\n          \n        that it would be rushed and confusing to fuse multiple stories in one short anime. In a way it is true. Most characters are not able to develop and sticks with the personality the show started with. If you are not paying attention the story can easily confuse you. The transition between story arcs are very brief, making it somewhat unsettling when it switches over.  \nThe actual story line:\nAs I mentioned before, there are multiple separate story lines. It amazed me when they all fit in so perfectly like a puzzle. Instead of multiple stories that were completely irrelevant to each other (eg. Darker than Black), they all came together and finished as one story.  The conclusion however, was somewhat disappointing due to the lack of closure with certain characters. \nCharacters:\nEvery character has their own unique personality(obviously). But the huge problem I had was the lack of character development. Off course all the characters are lovable, but it does get old after the first few episodes. I would say 90% of the characters will stay the same throughout the show. Their beliefs and actions are already set on the first episode and doesn't change. I understand the difficulty of cramming in character development on top of multiple stories in a short anime. But because it lacks character development, you can easily predict what the he/she will do ahead of time.\nSound:\nThe soundtrack is simply marvelous. I don't think I have ever been this addicted to an opening in my life. \nDo i recommend it? \nI would recommend Baccano if they ask for my opinion. I have been very critical, but the overall experience of the show is very good. The complex yet simple story lines will hook you instantly. The characters are lovable and the soundtrack makes you want to dance.Yes, the show definitely has flaws. But every show has flaws."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=28,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    The first thing to note before watching Baccano! is that the story starts off by introducing you over 20 characters at once, and can be very confusing.  However, don't let this deter you, as Baccano! offers a rather interesting take upon storytelling, giving the same story from many characters' point-of-view at once, which ties together by the end in a highly satisfying and well executed manner.\nThis sort of thing has been done quite often; a studio comes up with a great plot that makes sense, interesting and likable characters, a way to present the story in a way that pushes the bar; they start\n          \n        out well, but then end up like most do:  they fail.  Baccano! happens to be one of the instances where they actually succeed.\nNOTE:  Baccano! is somewhat gory, and does contain many scenes filled with blood and a few dismembered limbs here and there, as well as a few scenes of torture.  It does nothing to reach gory levels in anime such as Elfen Lied, but if you have a weak stomach, perhaps it is better to keep your distance.  Although I did not particularly like the more violent scenes, they don't last for very long, and it's easy to look past them to the great anime that they belong to.\nStory:  10\nThe story consists of three stories being told at once (and the very brief interludes to the present day, early 2000s, and one episode in the 1700s), taking place in the years of 1930, '31, and '32, jumping between the three several time frames in a single episode.  Each story involves many overlapping characters and involves all of them in some way or another.  The story itself isn't necessarily the series' strong point; it's pretty standard as stories go - what makes it stand out is the way in which the story is presented, how each piece of information revealed is carefully planned out and you're given enough to be satisfied and not get lost, while not giving away so much that it ruins the plot.  The story releases just the right amount of each plot line in each episode, finally culminating in the last two episodes, in which everything all finally comes together, and the grand unfolding occurs; it's well worth the wait.\nThe story does tend to make the jumps between it's three stories rather rapidly throughout an episode, and if you're not paying attention, it's easy to get lost.  My main advice would be to plan to watch the series when you're not going to be distracted easily many times during an episode, since as long as you follow along, the story makes sense.\nArt:  9\nThe art quality in Baccano! is nothing to shrug at.  The character design is exceptionally well done.  Nearly all of the main characters are well defined and very easy to identify immediately.  I did have some trouble recognizing a few characters for a while (as you are introduced to a large cast rather suddenly), but after a while, it became pretty easy to tell them apart.  One particularly great feature is the OP of Baccano!, which freeze-frames at every character and gives you their name.  This aids greatly in learning the characters quickly.\nThe quality of the animation is rather high, and remains high throughout the entire series, avoiding the drop in quality that many other series unfortunately suffer from.  Action scenes are fluid and easy to follow.\nSound:  9\nThe OP is the perfect fit to this anime.  The jazz tone that it sets is perfect for the feel of the series as a whole, and music played in the background throughout the various episodes maintains this same atmosphere.  The ED, however, is your standard j-pop number, and is rather disappointing.\nIn terms of voice acting, the voicing cast does exceedingly well at portraying their characters.  Not only do they bring personality to their respective characters, they also are rather easily distinguishable, making it easier to identify the large number of main characters from the rest.\nCharacter:  10\nThe characters of Baccano! are the series' strongest point, as they are well defined, unique (most of them), and the chemistry between them is simply amazing to behold.  Even the most annoying character (believe me, you won't have any trouble figuring out who it is) is redeemed at the end, and I even started to like him a bit.  The dynamic duo of Miria and Isaac is just brilliant, providing great entertainment just observing how they unwitting screw with everyone and somehow make things right in the end without ever knowing.  The humor between the two is great, although some people will no doubt find these two to be annoying.  By the end of this series, you are bound to find at least one character that you will like.  Although many of the characters receive a healthy dose of development, the large number of them makes it so that many feel somewhat underdeveloped, but this is expected considering that the series only consists of 13 episodes.\nEnjoyment:  10\nAs can be expected, when I first started watching this anime, I was very confused with the initial presentation.  However, as the story continued to progress, it steadily escalated until the final few episodes, where everything reached a great climax which was pulled into a satisfying ending to a great series.  \nThe only thing that I would say that was a drawback was that despite tying up nearly all the main important loose ends, there were still a few little things here and there that still had to be addressed (such as firmly establishing the identity of the people you meet at the very beginning and how they tie into the story).  However, that's what the 3 episode Baccano! OVA is for (hopefully; they are currently being released and I will check them out very soon to confirm), and I'd like to believe that it will explain everything else, as well as give even more character development.\nThe fact that they pulled off a complex story following a large number of characters in several time frames within a small total of 13 episodes is nothing to scoff at.  Despite the fact that many critics of the series could pretty easily point out a great number of minor flaws, the overall brilliance of the series outshines these small issues, and makes them more than easy to completely ignore.\nOverall:  10\nIn short, this anime is one that presents a great story, and most importantly, presents it well.  This is a series that almost anyone could pick up and find something to enjoy (except perhaps those with a great aversion to blood).  Although the series at first is hard to understand and will leave most viewers in confusion, the ending does a successful job of tying everything up, and everyone should have their initial questions well answered by then.  This is a series that I would readily recommend to just about anyone to at least try out and watch a few episodes.\nScore:  48/50; A (96%)\n        "},

Review\nor  This Reviewer Embraces the Fact that there is no Main Character\nBaccano! is a show which has taken parts of the anime community by storm, while simultaneously remaining relatively unknown to the larger whole. The series is frenetic and has more energy than perhaps any other anime. Each scene, while displayed with no heed for chronology, is nonetheless structured to introduce questions and answer them little by little, even if the answer is chronologically first. This is an interesting and ingenious structural choice, and also is in many ways responsible for the series' undeniable style. Baccano! does a good job of offering a\n          \n        little something for most everybody, without watering any of it down.\nBaccano! is a show that defies description. Generally speaking, it's about a number of people and a spattering of events which are connected, sometimes loosely and sometimes directly. More specifically, it is itself a story about these things and about stories in general. It, in some ways, comes close to breaking the fourth wall with its acknowledgment of the place of human subjectivity in any story. The framing of the series with the exchanges between Carole and the Vice-Director put the entire show in this context, and the re-telling of specific events from multiple perspectives provide examples as basis for the overall framework.\nBaccano!'s placement in the American prohibition era and embracing of this setting lends it a taste of the exotic. Even to American audiences, a unique take on the prohibition era such as this one seems foreign and wild, despite the familiarity of many of the places represented. Anyone who has ever seen a mafia movie feels at home, and yet at the same time it is made foreign to us. Unlike many other series which utilize a unique setting or particular aesthetic, Baccano!'s use of its setting, its powerful aesthetic, does not come off as heavy-handed. Baccano! oozes style without ever feeling the need to shove it in your face, allowing for someone to not connect with the aesthetic yet still enjoy the series overall. \nThe animation in Baccano! is definitely a strong point, even though it is a little rough around the edges. Stationary art in the series is certainly good, but nothing especially worth noting. In motion, though, the style of the series comes to realization with its somewhat flashy, rough animation style. Colors are bright and vibrant, matching the characters' flair and the feel of the setting. Despite some remarkably over the top designs, everything meshes very well within the series, and there is nothing which visually feels out of place, even the occasional CGI section.\nSound plays a unique role in Baccano! in reinforcing and bringing to life its setting. In this, through the use of primarily jazz and swing tracks with unique twists, the soundtrack is remarkably successful, lending a credibility to the endeavor without being vestigial or overbearing. The soundtrack is solid even without considering the above, and is definitely good enough to warrant listening to on its own. Within the series, it never really takes center stage&mdash;aside from the dramatic string piece that closes each episode&mdash;but instead achieves a healthy balance with the other aspects of the show, unlike many series with strong, aesthetically-driven soundtracks, such as Cowboy Bebop or Samurai Champloo. While not as strong on its own as those two, it does a better job of navigating its place within the overall work.\nThe voice-acting in Baccano! is unique in the anime world. It features few, if any, big name seiyuu, and, possibly as a result, is superbly cast. It is common for big name seiyuu to be included in a project for publicity and increased viewership, even where their voice does not fit the character, or where the show must be altered to accommodate the actor. In Baccano!, though, each voice actor fits their character extraordinarily well, and their performances overall are definitely solid, naturally bolstered by clever writing and a supporting soundtrack. As far as stand out performances, I must point out the seiyuu of Isaac and Miria, who managed to make what could have been very irritating characters enjoyable and fantastically entertaining. Ladd Russo's voice actor is also remarkably good, making a character who sounded simple and uninspired in description great in practice. As far as main characters are concerned, it is difficult to pinpoint a weak link, and the supporting cast is solid, if not as exemplary.\nIt is difficult to speak much on that plot of Baccano! without spoiling the mystery and the fun of it all, so I'll be brief and general. Baccano!'s plot is an evolving mystery which fills out completely the 13 episodes it inhabits. There is no idle time in Baccano!, and each scene fits very well into an overall picture. While this frenetic pace is paramount to the impressiveness of the series and to further its very postmodern style, at times it can be somewhat jarring. This, of course, is most likely intentional, considering the mindset of the rest of the series, but it does irk some, especially those less interested or familiar with postmodern literature. The plot itself is fairly straightforward if laid out chronologically, but the way it is presented makes it somewhat extraordinary. It does a better job of engaging the viewer in the plot, making them an active participant, than perhaps any other series I have seen. \nIf I had to point out a primary flaw of Baccano!, it would be the voluminous cast which limits the characterization of each. Each character is a larger than life, highly-stylized figure, but as a general rule there is little more to them than that. There is some nuance to each, but it is only in the relationships between the characters that they achieve depth, keeping this from becoming a crippling weakness. Even so, the aesthetically-charged character design is worth noting, differentiating each character powerfully from the others even in keeping with period attire&mdash;or at least a stylized, egalitarian version of it.\nBaccano! takes everything you know about anime and shows you that there is another way, all the while engaging you with a flashy mystery full of action and suspense. Flush with style and ripe with content, Baccano! manages to give the audience a little bit of everything, without feeling rushed or particularly shallow, although its biggest weakness is the lack of complexity in its characters and plot. It offers unforgettable characters, powerful aesthetics, and a great soundtrack to frame a frenetic narrative which challenges notions of narratives themselves. The series challenges you as a viewer, interpreter, and active participant. \nFinal Score: 9/10"},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=26,   ["text"]="                          \n    This anime has always been on my radar for the past couple of years but never had a chance to watch it. Until after I saw a blog stating that it's one of the best dub anime out there. Then what the heck I gave it a shot. It was very good.\nBaccano looks like an action anime that involves a lot of guns and mafia at first glance. Well, it does have one but mix with a supernatural element of immortality, then you find out that's the point of the show all along. \nThis anime will confuse you, but in a good way. It's confusing\n          \n        because it does not have a straight forward narration; the story goes back and forth from different events in each episode. The narration is like a puzzle, all jumbled until you watch the whole series then it will all make sense in the end. It was a clever way to tell the story. For me the structure of how the story told wasn't fun, the good thing is the characters made things interesting for you.\nBaccano has wide variety of personalities. The show composes of unique individuals like psychopaths, silly thieves, a crybaby badass and genuine couples. These characters will grow on you, especially Isaac and Miria. Subjectively, Isaac and Miria is the most fun anime couple you will ever watch. Both characters are always in-sync with their silly antics and as comical characters they may be these duo are the driving force that made the plot move forward indirectly. You won't see a couple like these two in any other anime, only in Baccano!\nThe only real issue I have was it was too short. Like you will wish some characters will show something more to offer and see them in a new scenario or sub plot; back stories like why this character became an assassin in the first place things like that.\nIt may turn people off with how the narration was constructed but trust me watch the whole thing. It is a mature anime but handled lightheartedly. It has a cool atmosphere in it with great action scenes, catchy jazz music and a large cast of characters. Overall, Baccano! is a worth to watch.\n"},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=26,   ["text"]="                          \n    If I am to be perfectly honest in my opinion on this anime, I would have to say that I think it is overrated. In seeing positive reviews of Baccano (and seeing that other compared it to Durarara, an anime I liked very much) I figured I should give it a shot. But I was very disappointed. \nAgain, to be honest, I did not watch the entire series. But here is why: \nStory - Here is one thing I fairly enjoyed. I love the time period and setting of this anime, and I think the story had some good potential to develop. But it just\n          \n        never quite got there for me. Halfway through the series, and I was still utterly confused as to what was going on. I definitely appreciate an anime that takes a different route from convential storytelling methods, but every now and then I would like to have some semblance of what is going on, and here I just never got it. \nArt & Sound - This is something Baccano really excelled in. I love the art style and not only were the characters well drawn, but the backgrounds were always wonderful to look at as well. I also thought the voice acting was fantastic (recognized a few from other animes that I love) and stayed true to the time period. \nCharacters - Again, I was half way through the series, and still had no idea who is who and what their main goal/purpose/direction in the story was. I am the type of person who likes to develop a bond with the characters - some kind of empathy towards them, be able to relate to them, even when the setting is so far from my own reality. But here I could never get to that point. I developed no attachment to any characters or their plight. Perhaps this is just an issue of personal preference in terms of pacing in animes. \nEnjoyment - I just couldn't get into this anime. I couldn't make sense of it and I felt nothing for the characters, therefore I lost patience with it. Perhaps if I had continued watching, it would have eventually gotten there, but with every episode leaving me wanting, I saw no reason to continue. It came down to me forcing myself to watch another episode hoping that it would get better, and that's just no way to watch an anime. \nOverall - Sorry to burst the bubble of so many other positive reviews, but I would not recommend this anime to anyone other than someone who is only interested in wonderful art and sound and willing to put up with excruciatingly slow story and character development for such a short anime. I think that this series requires a lot of patience, which I apparently lack. \n        "},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=26,   ["text"]="                          \n    Too ambitious without the writing to match. A boring, confusing mess of a story with a huge cast of one-dimensional characters.\n★☆☆☆☆\nI just do not understand the praise this show gets. As of right now, it stands at 8.62/10 and ranked #58. That’s pretty impressive—at least that’s what I thought—but this was the show that made me question anything on MyAnimeList. An 8/10 is meaningless when Dragon Ball Z is rated 8.28/10. Are you guys even trying to be objective? I think you’d better off with having a “Shit/Not Shit” rating system.\nI’m beginning to think the people who like Baccano! do so because it makes them\n          \n        feel smart. They “get” the story. They can follow it and appreciate all delicious complexities. They can keep up with its “non-linear” storytelling. Anyone who doesn’t understand this must be goddam peasant with the IQ of a vegetable.\nBaccano! is shit, and you should feel bad for ever recommending this garbage to someone. It’s just gimmick after gimmick that tricks you into thinking it’s better than actually is. If you break it down to the fundamentals of good story telling it fails.\nI’ll admit that it’s ambitious—just like another certain show I’ve reviewed (hint: the first word is “Sword” and ends in “Shit”). Baccano! juggles a huge cast, multiple intersecting plotlines, different time periods, and attempts it in 16 episodes. It’s admirable, but when your ambition is that big you better fucking bring your A-game.\nAnd Baccano! fails miserably. It’s so obvious that the writers’ goals could not be met by their abilities. It’s all gimmicks and flash to cover up poor writing. I can forgive boring characters if the story and plotting were good. I can forgive a shit story if the characters are charming enough. But Baccano! has neither. The show 24 has some terribly shallow characters, but, goddamn, you cannot say it doesn’t keep your ass glued to the seat.\nThere are so many characters, and almost all of them are forgettable. I get it. You’ve got a big cast, and you don’t have time to give everyone an episode to tell their sad, childhood story. Then cut or combine some characters. I couldn’t tell one gangster from another, and there were too many characters I didn’t understand what purpose they served to the story other than just existing. Worse, the shows tries for this authentic, Prohibition era America setting only to have the tone ruined by some lame, “anime”-styled characters. There’s a lot of dialogue that is just embarrassingly cheesy.\nThe story is told in a “non-linear” way which is just another way of saying, “Fuck you if you can’t keep track of every little detail, you mongoloid.” The plotting skips around so much you can’t tell if you’re watching a flashback. One moment you’re trying to understand what’s happening and it’ll cut to different characters in the past without any indication. This isn’t innovative or bold. It’s confusing. I’m not asking to be spoon-fed a story. Nobody is, but it’s up to you as the writer to balance between telling the story in an engaging way and making sure it’s understood.\nMost of the “story” takes place on a train. I cannot stress the quotes around the word “story” enough because there is none. Now I thought it was gonna be one of those coincidence stories where everyone is going after the same thing on the same day in the same place, and the fun comes from them figuring out how to deal with each other. You’ve got gangsters dealing with thieves and an urban legend monster lurking on the train. That would’ve been 100x more exciting than what I actually got which was none of that. They’re literally just on the train for no reason. They run into each and stuff happens. There’s no ultimate goal or something to accomplish, and when you don’t have that why the fuck should I care?\n\"Blending sci-fi and pulp fiction to create an entertaining saga unlike any other, this action-packed anime series revolves around the exploits of a group of immortal 18th-century alchemists currently living as Prohibition-era gangsters.\"\nThe Netflix description is as exciting as the show gets.\nIt doesn’t even explore or do anything with its immortality gimmick—which was what got me interested in the first place. When they finally talk about it doesn’t have any effect on the rest of the story. You could’ve taken it out, and it’d still be the same boring shit.\nAnd after all this you’re left asking, “What was Baccano! even about?” It’s sad when the only thing I liked was the opening.\n        "},

Unfortunately, I am one of those blind and discouraged people, but my curiosity about high ratings has once again given me the chance to experience great art. I encourage everyone who are still unfamiliar with Baccano to check it out because this series is definitely a MUST WATCH.\nBaccano is a story about a series of mysterious events connected to immortality which occur in\n          \n        the years 1711, 1931-1932 and 2001. It is told in an interestingly complex chronology and is very rich in content in a way that it has so many genres. This is a comedy, suspense, thriller, drama, romance, action, supernatural, mystery, horror, etc. One would not expect all these in a story because there would be a case of incompatibility and everything would be in disarray. Funny and shocking gore just don't go together, but here, they are all in excellent harmony.\nThe animation is high standard. The character and environment drawings are fit and well designed with beautiful and proper colors. Everything is well animated with good movement details, consistent frame quality, and light effects which bring about nice action scenes. Top-notch sounds, good ambience and exceptional voice acting. All voices are well chosen and are perfectly fitted for all characters. The OP is also good with fitting jazz music but the ED however is disappointing.\nIt has great casting. Filled with various characters that are unique and most interesting, this is one of the best points of the show. You have alchemists, mafias, psycho killers, delinquents, a newspaper and informant group, a comic thief duo, a homunculus, a train monster, etc. All of them are well made, with unique traits and sensible purposes.\nBaccano gives outstanding enjoyment. You will laugh, you will be thrilled, you will be shocked, you will be curious and you will want more. Well actually, you will demand more because in the 13 episodes some things were not explained so hopefully, the OVAs would cover those holes in the story.\n        "},

(aka the “Pulp Fiction” of anime) is a show that can only be described as unconventional. It doesn’t tell one story; it tells 3 (4 including the specials). It doesn’t have a main character; it has tons of equal ones. It doesn’t go in order; it goes out of order. It doesn’t have a genre; it makes up its own. This is the kind of show that you just can’t explain to people. They have to watch it for themselves, and they SHOULD watch it for themselves, because it\n          \n        really is that unique.\nThe story of Baccano is unlike anything that you have ever seen before in an anime, I can tell you that much for sure. It completely and totally rewrites the rules of storytelling and creates an atmosphere of unmatched originality. Rather than telling a single story, this anime elects to tell three of them. The catches are this: 1: The stories are all told at the same time, and 2: None of the stories are told in chronological order. What does that mean for the viewer? Well, I’ll tell you: You MUST pay attention while you are watching or will get VERY lost VERY fast. Those prompts in the beginning of each scene that tell you what year the scene takes place in? Those are VERY important. The end of Baccano is the beginning, the beginning is the end, and middle is just… well… complicated. However, the craziest part of this show isn’t how unconventional it is, but rather the fact that it accomplishes its ridiculously ambitious goals in only 13 episodes (16 if you include the specials, which you should)! I couldn't believe the intricacy of the plot; it accomplished twice what normal animes accomplish in half the time. There is no point in attempting to give a synopsis of Baccano because of how impossible it would be cover the subject without spoilers, so I’ll just say this: the setting is 1930’s Chicago and shit is going down, so hold on to your hats. Can it be overly convoluted at times yes? Yes. Is it perfect? No. Does that stop the storyline from being AMAZING? Hell no.\nThe characters in Baccano are just as unique and intriguing as the plot is, and that is what propels the show into the upper echelon of anime. I’ll admit that I was very skeptical of this cast at first; I thought the show was biting off more then they could chew by going with such a massive number of characters and refusing to give any of them the lead role. However, I was quickly proved wrong. Very wrong. The characters cover the entire goddamn spectrum, and I am not exaggerating. They range from hilarious (Isaac and Miria), to badass (Luck), to likeable/human (Firo), to mysterious (Czeslaw), to psychotic (Ladd) to much, MUCH more. There are just too many noteworthy characters for me to try to go over them all. If I had to complain, which I do (considering this is a review), I will point out that there are minor balancing issues as certain characters are a tiny bit lacking in development because of the nature of the storytelling and the short anime length. However, considering the circumstances, these characters just blew me away. Essentially all of them are extremely well done, and I loved a TON of them.\nThere is one more thing about Baccano that I feel the need to discuss; it may be somewhat controversial, but it needs to be said; when you watch Baccano, WATCH THE ENGLISH DUB. I know that dubs usually suck, but this one most certainly does NOT. The casting could not have been more perfect and the voice actors give just as much emotion to their characters as the Japanese cast did, but the real reason you should watch it dubbed is for dem accents. Unlike the subbed version, the actors in the dub all have realistic Northern-US gangster accents (or whatever accent is appropriate for the particular character) that provide an element of immersion that you don’t get with the subbed version. It’s up to you, of course, but my recommendation has been made, obviously. As for the music: STELLAR. The OP is awesome, the OST is awesome, the ED is awesome, and everything is just awesome. More importantly though, the music fits in with the tone of the show. Dat jazz music is so smoooooooth. There is also nothing to complain about in the animation department; it won’t blow you away given its age, but its very fluent.\nIf you are looking for something different, you have found it in Baccano!. If you aren’t looking for something different… well… watch Baccano! anyway. This show is just too good and too unique for any anime fan to miss out on. It’s not perfect, but it is a masterpiece nonetheless, and that’s not something you can understand until you watch it for yourself.\n        "},

A commotion, a confusion and lots of noise.\nThe action follows a perfect pace, very easy to follow, the art is good and the animation is appropriate to the pace and environment of the whole series. The story setting is also very interesting, since stories during the 30s and the American recession are not common.  However, some details ruin what could be a perfect piece. \nThe first thing is that whoever commanded that plot tried to confuse us, the viewers, by mixing temporal states randomly. In\n          \n        a scene we are at the 30s the following we are pilgrims sailing to the Land of Freedom and Fortune. This would be ok if they did not give us that information. Saying 'now we're going to the 30s' before the scene was not a good trick. It is easy to get used to the pace this way and by the middle of the series I already had the notion of the relationship between characters. \nThe second motif of my disapproval are the characters. From the little girl that is doing the investigation (and no more information is given about her, which I found amazing. In a bad way, but still amazing) to the random criminals at the train, that simply do not add or take anything from the story or plot. Some of them seem to be there just to fill space, others were extremelly interesting but nothing but the strictly necessary while the most idiot characters were explored to an extreme that turned them boring.\nAs third and final detail is the humour. Easy, fast paced, silly. Everything a comic relief appreciator does not appreciate. Fairly good moments of humour were interrupted by random moe screaming or were continued to exhaustion.\nEven though this anime flaws on three very important details, they do not ruin the enjoyment of the series due to its pace. The characterization of the scenery and overall environment is also good (fails sometimes due to some very 'japanesque' actions and the whole language setting) and even such an incredible story as immortal mafia seems possible along the way. The great victory of Bacanno! is, without any doubt, the pace supported by the animation and music.\nOverall, a great anime that is nearly impossible to dislike. I highly recommend it, just because it's such an easy, amusing and fun thing to watch.\n        "},

For probably 10 straight seconds, this guy is going off on some rant about nothing while beating the guy to death. That wasn't entertainment, it was torture. The only thing missing was the trope-tastic \"licking the lips\" thing that has become so common these days (he probably does it in a later episode).\nI gave this show a good four episodes to show me something interesting story-wise or give me anything really, but it only got worse. If you watch the first episode or make it to the second and you're not engaged or enthralled in any way; trust me and drop it now. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=22,   ["text"]="                          \n    The 1930s were a time when many societies hit economic depressive lows, Black Tuesday might have been the start of the Great Depression, but it reared its ugly head and took hold of the lives of many people in the 30s, leaving them desitute and struggling to make ends meet. Yet, there were those lurking in the shadows that made it big and continued to live in luxury, a luxury entangled in blood, deception, and sometimes just by the luck of the draw.\nYes, I'm speaking about the original gangster: three-piece suit, gun-toting, aspiring rebel youths with an ambition and a resolve towards their respective families\n          \n        and causes. And they weren't simply that. If you've ever seen \"The Godfather\"; \"Road to Pertition\" or \"Once Upon a Time in America\" you would know that to step into the arms of the \"family\" meant unyelding support but also uncertain, relentless death. So bloody, twisted, and sudden that it made death seem like it wasn't the worst thing that could happen.\nBaccano! is perhaps the first anime series that I've seen that takes the period of the 1930s and dives into the hearts of several gangsters, all with very distinct personalities - something that makes this stand uniquely from its peers. A pair of effective con-artists, a man with a lust for blood, a young man welcomed for the first time into a mafia family, a man with a secret, elongated past, a woman who fights alongside her \"supposed\" father, and even a young boy who faces torments worse than death itself. Put it all together, and you only have a part of the story that Baccano showcases.\nBaccano's execution may throw some off a bit to start - handing 17 characters already suggests this series is devilishly ambitious, but yet it presents a rather looping story revolving around these characters that seem to \"crash\" into each other, whether knowingly or just by situtational connections. The storyline jumps back and forth between the years of 1930-1932 primarily, though there are treks to both the past and present in brief context. There's definite story here: it's mainly driven by the characters, and it's also driven by thematics that drive this beyond a traditional gangster story.\nDoes it execute it well? On most points, a definite yes. The story starts along with enough of a blood bath of violence to capture attention on one hand, but also mixing humor, action, and intelligent swagger to appeal to those who like traditional gangster stories. However, there's a catch - there are elements of this series, which I won't spoil, that twist the tale as the progression comes forward-and revolve around the character identities that ties them all together-you can say it deals with alchemy, superstition, and a lust for power/domination. There's not just one story in Baccano, there are several, and they're all occurring in fragmented conjunction, some are precursors to certain events (the first episode, as confusing as it may be, is a good example of this), while others occur in sequence with other events. If this seems overbearingly confusing, then chances are that you may be the wrong audience for this series, as the fragmented method of storytelling is sequenced in each episode in pieces, some of which are expanded upon in further episodes and pick up \"in medias res\".\nThe definition of the characters helped the story along, but I found myself sometimes saying that the format also, somewhat, took away from the progression. Fragmented stories tend to fragment characters in a manner of snapshots, and thus backstories can find themselves, though told, awkward in presentation. With a series with so many characters, this can become a problem. Example, while Miria and Issac are two wonderfly comedic characters this side of a mentally skewed Bonnie and Clyde, there wasn't much to readily develop them. Then again, this series isn't so much about character development as it is about character definition. Those who take that into consideration may enjoy this series a lot more.\nThe ending of the series was all action driven, and leaves many threads bare which was something I didn't always like, but I liked the resolution in some of the relationships, some of which I could see well from the first of the series, while others...had only begun to surface in the latter half.\nBaccano's animation is actually quite well done for a modern adaptation of a mafia based story. The setting backdrops accurately reflect Depression/Prohibition era America among other plot settings, yet one might find the character design a bit inconsistent in some points. I'm probably one of the few who really did enjoy the character design as it reflects the characters in a more realistic manner than most anime series.\nI'd argue that the action sequences aren't nearly to the level of gun-toting seen in series like Gunslinger Girl or the characters as \"pretty\", but they feel realistically portrayed.\nBaccano's soundtrack is one I would highly recommend to those who love Jazz music. Gun's and Roses \"Paradise Lunch\" is a nice \"big band\" opening that I loved watching with the opening of the series, fitting the style and sequence of the series to a tee. Noting the era this series takes place, it's relevant to the backdrop of the anime. The ending theme is a beautiful ballad: Kaori Oda's \"Calling\" fits the ending sequence quite well, and it's one of the best ending themes I've heard this past season. In-series music stands strongly rooted in the era, appropriate in both the comedic scenes as well as dramatic contexts.\nThe Japanese voice acting couples the effect of the overall cast by giving it much stronger hold than it would otherwise have. Coupled with the distinctive presence of each character, their voice actors (particularly I have to give credit to Luck's VA, cool but quite mature) shape them well, but as I'll note in the character section, some of these characters didn't really have roles to fill enough for their VAs to help them.\nThere were characters within this series I really enjoyed watching, and others that I felt fell off the ladder because they were never really given a due chance other than standing in the pale shadow of other characters. It was something within Baccano I feared coming into the series about with the sheer number, yet, if you watch this series for more character definition than development, it doesn't necessarily take away from the experience.\nTake Miria and Issac for example, off the wall, terribly hilarious duo of petty thieves and con-artists, and probably two of the characters that really drove Baccano for me in its overall course. They pretty much seem like a duo that's lifted right from a old comedy sketch routine, but with a certain backwards logic that makes them seem smarter than they actually are. Either by dumb luck or just clever wit, the two seem to avoid danger and live life on their own terms. Some may view them as a bit over-the-top, but for me they really carried the series in terms of enjoyment. You learn to love them, even if they don't have much backstory because that's not what brings out their characters, their sheer definition does.\nNow compare that duo to Ladd and Lua. Ladd is a very defined character, no doubt a sadist that almost makes you want to chuckle at him at first..makes me think of a younger horror Jack Nicholson role (most people probably won't agree with me on that though) with tongue in cheek statements that make him seem cool and at the same time show how seriously insane he is in his lust for blood. Then put Lua into the picture, a female who doesn't really have much of a mark on anything except being the one Ladd pledges \"to kill first\"...in an almost twisted display of affections. Lua's character doesn't amount to much, she's just...there.\nCompare Lua to Ennis, a woman with a mysterious past and connections within her mafia upbringing that lends Firo to look into her identity after a chance encounter. Ennis, I would argue, is one of the female characters that really stands out more than the other females, not necessarily for her combative specialty, but her characterization. In the scheme of the series, we get snapshots of her character. I actually really liked Ennis and Firo's chemistry, and considering how they meet and the events they face together, that made them also a duo that I really enjoyed. Jacuzzi and Nice were pretty much in the same way: Jacuzzi is a seeming crybaby who becomes a leader of a gang, and he becomes more respectable when he puts his best face forward, that by the end, I really did like his character. Nice is a kick-butt female character whom you can tell has an affection for Jacuzzi, but sometimes shortchanged because you don't see \"enough\" of her to balance her character with Jacuzzi.\nAmong the other \"good\" mafia members is Maiza, probably the only character with the strongest sense of backstory and the thread that ties all of the characters presented in the series together. His role has much to do with the hidden plot, and in one particular arc of the series, you find that he's not only a partner to Firo, but also one with a dark past and secrets of his own.\nOther strong characters included Luck, well defined particular to his roles in his set arcs, Silzard, who plays the central conflictive role in the series in thematic and in identity, and Czes, whom one might dismiss as a bitter kid, but the series provides a bird's eye view into his experiences to see his reasoning.\nEve's pursuit of her brother Dallas was an interesting arc with its backdrop characters (particularly with Luck), yet I found Eve and Dallas' roles to be stronger when in conjunction with the stronger characters (i.e. a nice scene with Eve, Miria, and Issac later on in the series provided a few laughs).\nBaccano! is a series with definitive class and style that is unique to most anime series in the present of its year, and one that I think many will enjoy for those factors. I would say it's among the strongest I've seen in it's respective action/period genre, yet there were some holes and characterization parts of the series that I felt weren't as strong as they could have been. There's a potential of depth this series could have achieved both with its storyline and even with the chance of \"playing around\" more with the period elements. Yet, I enjoyed this on quite many levels, and would recommend it.\n        "},

How do you unfold the story, then, if the story began way before the appearance of the main character? Where do you start the story?\nBaccano is the first non-chronological anime I've watched after Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu. The first scenes were too incoherent that I was almost going to stop watching Baccano in the first episode.\nI'm glad I didn't.\nWell, then, let's start the review.\nOverall: 10\nFor few hours after I finished the anime, I just sat there. It was the best thing I have ever watched.\n          \n        The amazing twists, appropriate soundtracks, colorful characters, comedies in between and old yet distinct art...It was a whole new experience to me. In terms of story, there will never be as good an anime for a long time.\nStory: 10\nAs I said earlier, the story was a perfection. The author used non-chronological method to increase the suspense and questions yet not dropping the interest rate. As the episodes went on, pieces all fit together and all the stories explained themselves. Like Inception, these kind of stories are the hardest to write and think of. I give my bow to the author of Baccano.\nArt: 10\nThe art wasn't exactly a clean one, neither was it a graphical innovation. However, the art was detailed and well-expressed. In the scenes where a sense of terror had to be expressed, the characters' facial expressions wonderfully summed up the situation. Moreover, the swift movements of the battle scenes of the characters were beautifully shown, so much that it was as if seeing two actual people clash inside the monitor.\nSound: 10\nThe opening of Baccano, Roses&Guns, is one of the few instrumental openings. These kinds of openings are often frowned upon or dodged by the aniime industries because their adversary drops down with their \"boring\" openings. However, Baccano's composer did a wonderful job of expressing the witty and comedic everyday life of the mafias. It uses the sax to express the mood of the 18th and 19th century and fast tunes to express the twisting series of events.\nMoreover, the soundtracks were all kicked in at the right time, and neither was it too frequent. The anime displayed the right songs at right times, and silenced at right times. For example, for a mysterious mood, the bass played a low-pitched plucks followed by high-pitched violins, adding up to the mysterious mood.\nCharacter: 10\nGoing back to the first question, who is the main character of the story? Is he/she the center of the story? No! Baccano shows the quality of the main character by proving that even the central character of the story could not be the main character because he/she lacks \"main-characterishness\".  However, really, the main character in the story is everyone! The author showed that everyone is his/her own main character in their own story. By holding more than one story in one series, this anime was able to establish every character as his/her own main character.\nSpeaking of establishing, the anime does an amazing job of establishing all characters. It never leaves out a character. It develops all characters, major or minor and not \"fires\" the extras just because they are extras. This kind of character development is one of the hardest and the most tricky kind, but Baccano was able to pull it off.\nEnjoyment: 10\nAlthough the series as a whole is a story of mafias, the anime is never too dark or too light. It contains the right amount of composure while kicking in some slapstick comedies and interesting development. By either using the \"basic\" comedy characters or displaying an interesting yet quite comical development, the anime never takes the viewers deep into the abyss.\nBaccano is an interesting anime. Certainly it doesn't have the best animators in the world, nor does it have the best reviews in the world, but it does have an amazing hook and non-chronological twists that keeps the viewers' heart beating. For that, I shall give 10/10.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Baccano! is one of my personal favourite anime, and how it got itself there is due to the storyline and characters, the original creator being Narita Ryohgo, also writing the original novel for Durarara!!, also a great anime adaptation. At first, the plot may seem a little confusing, but later, it reveals its real colours of being a story about gangsters, mafia, immortal people and more. \nStory: 10/10\nThe story of Baccano! is outstanding and very intriguing, following a cast of very different people. It is quite a western style anime, with you gangsters, and the opening theme song. The story progresses with it jumping around\n          \n        the timeline, going back and forwards, but the main story takes place on a transcontinental railway train, the Flying Pussyfoot, with a multitude of characters all on the same train.\nAnimation and Art: 9/10\nThe animation quality is fantastic given that the animation studio is Brain’s Base, with great notable works being Durarara!! and Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. I would say that the only flaw in the animation is that some of the scenes are quite dark, so it is kind of hard to tell what’s going on. Other than that, I would say that the animation is superb, with especially great action scenes, with Brain’s Base being an animation studio with lots of skill.\nSound: 9/10\nThe soundtrack of Baccano is superb. Since it is a western style of anime, from the jazz opening to the soundtracks are masterfully selected to match the mood and theme of the series, which are mostly jazz tunes. A downside to the music was the ending, but the rest of the music, was absolutely wonderful.\nCharacters: 10/10\nEveryone single one of the characters in Baccano! are all masterfully designed, from the lovable idiots Isaac and Miria, the bloodthirsty and psychotic Ladd, to the mysterious conductor Claire. They all have unique quirks that makes them all special in a way. The story may be wide and random at times, but each and every character all have a connection to each other and each other’s fates.\nOverall, I enjoyed Baccano! a lot, especially the outstanding character cast and story. It is a great story with drama, comedy, supernatural and action in one, and is one of the few unique anime that really stands out with its storytelling style. \nOverall: 9/10"},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    A show with Top 100 stats on both ends of MyAnimeList is worthy of a little attention and combined with having friends who both loved and hated the show made me enter it with quite a large amount of curiousity. A definite good thing about Baccano is it instantly thrusts the viewer into its OP, a very snazzy and jazzy piece that introduces you to the important players of the show in a way that feels like it is lifted right out of a Quentin Tarantino movie. It is quite effective at setting the mood of the show and doing something which I feel the\n          \n        show does, for the most part, effectively: Showing instead of telling. Showing off all these characters in the OP and effectively means we skip a fair deal of silly introduction and get into things faster.\nThe plot itself takes a nonlinear format that instantly made me think of Pulp Fiction, with Isaac and Miria filling a similiar role to Pumpkin and Honey Bunny. Aboard the train the Flying Pussyfoot, a collection of the main characters in our opening (mostly) all board it for a variety of reasons, with their motivations and how they got there being told in frequent story sections and cuts to the past and future to show us. The nonlinear story telling for the most part works, but in a few places it leaves plot lines fraying and irrelevant to the overall narrative, with this being most obvious with the stuff involving Eve, as most of the things relevant to the plot occur during the Firo plot anyway. I feel as though chopping off a few less relevant plot threads for some of the stronger or more notable ones would have done a very good job at stregthening the narrative.\nGoing into each plot into full detail would not only greatly spoil the show, but also take forever to actually go over, so I'll mostly briefly go over the primary plot on the Flying Pussyfoot. It primarily focuses on the entanglement of multiple forces who are all plotting to take control of the train for different reasons, ranging from an ill-thought-out robbery to the release of a prisoner from a US Senator via extortion, and how all of them collide together. Some get more screen time than others, with Nice and her group feeling sadly irrelevant. One great thing though is that three of the best characters in the show get the most screen time in the show: The duo of Isaac and Miria and their crazy, stupid and hilarious antics, and Ladd Russo, an assassin of the Russo family who lives for the thrill of murder and is ABSOLUTELY insane, although somehow NOT the craziest or edgiest character in the show.\nThese three together do a good job carrying a feel deal of the show with hilarious antics with some drama to them, and the show is usually at its best when focusing on their antics. In addition to the plot of everyone colliding on the train, there is the plot of the supernatural \"Rail Tracer\", an entity seen in Isaac and Miria's made-up story that goes onto trains and gobbles up all of its passengers...right before a string of murders begins just as described! I won't go into detail here, in part because discussing anything aside from the basics essentially requires spoiling you on a major plot point, but I will say that the Rail Tracer story line was very disappointing to me, and that I wish they had gone for something with a more supernatural, maybe even less explained edge. And yes I know that it has to follow the light novels, but that doesn't mean I have to like that part of the light novel's storyline.\nI also personally found the stuff with Szilard slightly...disappointing for what is essentially the buildup of one of the bigger bad guys on the show, although this is moreso whenw e see the stuff with him in the past rather than him in the future. again, difficult to discuss, as the nonlinear nature of the plot can make discussing one thing a spoiler for other parts.\nThe plot felt like it would have benefitted from some streamlining to be really good, like removing Eve's plot, but instead ends in a spot where it goes from anywhere between really fun (Isaac and Miria or Ladd being insane) to somewhat interesting but not breathtaking (stuff with the Gandors and Firo) to active dislike (the Rail Tracer). The decidedly mixed end bag ends the show on a feeling of average plot.\nArt-wise and sound-wise, the show is good with a variety of character designs, some pretty well handled shots, some decently jazzy backgrounds and a really nice OP. It isn't anything that will BLOW YOU AWAY or anything, but it looks noticeably good and has some really good voice acting (NOTE: I watched the sub), like Isaac, Miria, Ladd and Nice's. Jacuzzi's voice actor was perhaps too good at his job, though, as there were a few times it made me want to really punch the character.\nThe show ultimately ended up feeling, to me, like something with plenty of bits of good and bad that all got souped and mixed together, and a work with a bit too little room to breathe in it. The good outweighs the bad to me, I think, but the Rail Tracer plotline ends up a solid disappointment that harms some earlier segments, and the complex narrative combined with the amount of characters it is juggling means that it ends up dropping some balls. Worth a watch when it has a good deal to chew on, but not something I think I'll find myself remembering a lot.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="                          \n    Stories with a non-linear narrative can be a pleasant change to the usual approach as these can be arguably more interesting as it can take alluring twists and turns to the plot, as well as being able to provide more diverse themes that could possibly not work well with a linear narrative. However, this method can be difficult to convey to audiences in a satisfying manner as it can be either overly confusing, or contains an underdeveloped cast, in addition to a weak story. Bacanno! is such a non-linear story which presents an interesting premise with a distinguishable cast of characters, yet lacks in some\n          \n        departments which ultimately hinders this piece from being a great anime.\nThe story of Bacanno! is centered around various story-lines that ultimately converges with each other: the bloody trail of the train \"Flying Pussyfoot\", the mafia wars, the missing brother, the search for the bottles of immortality, all of them taking place in the 30's; and finally, alchemist discovering immortality in 1711. It goes without saying that the unusual narrative is confusing the first few episodes, as a lot of information is relaid to viewers in a short amount of time, in addition to all the characters involved. It has been mentioned that this work is difficult to follow, yet this is not entirely the case: as long as viewers are focused upon the three mysteries of the anime, it is in fact easy to keep up. What is curious about the anime is the fact on how all these stories are tied to each other, as often the execution and implementation of these can go wrong; yet the anime managed to maintain a satisfying pacing as well as conclusion to the series.\nNaturally, with a relatively short duration of only 16 episodes (including the specials), it is not able to fully explore the diverging story-lines, which in turn may leave viewers disappointed. This concerns mainly the mafia wars as well as the alchemist discovering immortality. The lack of development concerning these two hindered the story, as opposed as the other two stories mentioned previously, which were well executed. However, which was a pleasant to see was the setting itself: the 1930's of New York. It was refreshing to see the customs, technology and people and how these differed from current society, not to forget the mafia's which New York was known for in the 30's. Naturally it isn't a perfect representation of New York with the cast of characters, yet this was not an issue at a personal level, as the presentation of the city itself was great.\nThe characters of Bacanno! are certainly distinguishable from each other, being both likable and varied at the same time. However, due to the vast amount of characters, these are in fact underdeveloped for most part of its short duration. Furthermore, although not much of an issue, these can be basically categorized in psychopaths, forgettable characters, silent and cunning, or just plain eccentric. The problem with some of its cast is that motives behind some of their eccentricities or personalities are hardly explained, making it just feel as it was for the convenience for the plot. This doesn't apply to the whole cast, yet it is clearly visible when a big deal of characters have this very problem.\nAs for the development itself, the anime offers some in some characters enough development to be satisfying, be it either realization of one self, fear or loneliness. However, the various interactions between the characters is certainly very well done, which in turn makes up to a certain degree the aforementioned issues. Audiences are either engaged on how the author develops and portrays the different encounters between the difference in personalities, be it either Jacuzzi Splot and his kind, yet whiny personality (which surprisingly wasn't irritating) dealing with the strong and arrogant people; or even Claire Stanfield and the silent Chane. Not to mention Isaac and Miria, which can be very entertaining to watch due to their simple-minded nature, yet admittingly could be annoying at times.\nConcerning the animation of the anime, it was well executed alongside fluid motions on both characters and environment; some inconsistencies could be found, yet were overall not detrimental to the experience. Nevertheless, the various action scenes were splendidly animated. As for the art style itself, it is nothing out of the norm with satisfying character design being both varied and befitting for the character's personalities. However, both backgrounds and characters were at times blurry and very simplistic, but considering the small budget it was easily overlookable.\nThe soundtrack used in Bacanno! was splendid and very befitting of the atmosphere it was trying to portray: the 1930's of New York. Jazz compositions are prevalent which serve to attribute the anime a somewhat unique soundtrack (albeit some compositions being forgettable) that complements with the different scenes at given moments. As for the voice acting, these were splendid and just right for the various characters that were presented, which in turn made the distinct personalities of the cast shine. The opening of the series had a great tune to it that gave an accurate representation of the series, whereas the ending was rather disappointing.\nOverall Baccano! was a very enjoyable anime with an interesting approach on the narrative as well as it diversity of its cast, in which both sound and the setting matched to convey a great atmosphere. However, due to its duration, the anime had not enough time to properly develop and flesh out most of its cast, in addition to some of the main stories, which ultimately was a bit disappointing at a personal level. The specials of the series do indeed tie some loose ends which may have left some viewers wondering about various outcomes, so I would suggest watching these as well. Regardless of said issues, I really enjoyed this piece and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a non-linear narrative alongside a likable cast of characters.\nThank you for reading.\n        "},

One of those anime is Baccano. \nThe most impressive thing is that only in 13 eps, they managed to tell 3 stories that took place in different times and spaces. 13 eps guys .. and the stories are not small at all .. \nAnother thing is that those stories have always something in common besides the main plot line, i mean, the characters. There are characters that only participated in one story while some characters joined in the 3 stories. \n\nStory: 9/10. As i said, Baccano has 3 different stories\n          \n        but .. there is more. This anime not only had time to explore 3 different things, but also to connect them in a proper way. Yeah connecting 3 stories is easy .. now connecting 3 stories like Baccano does, is another thing. \nThe pace is fast as the Pussyfoot (the name of the train were one of the stories take place), which is at the same time good and bad. In one hand, being fast doesn´t make the anime boring because is always one thing happening, but the pace is so high that it can have the opposite effect. There is just so many characters, so many information, so many things being throwed at you at the same time can be painfull. I mean you may get confuse with it and you will unless you have a perfect memory. \nThere is so many things to record that some may be forgoten. Anyways that is a minor a problem so don´t get worried. In the end the pace slows down a little bit so you are able to understand everything from the stories.\nArt: 7/10. When it comes to cut fingers, well Baccano excels at it xD. The rest is \"meh\". The background is weak, there is no much detail on it. The character design is pretty simple. However, unlike some animes i've seen, they don´t look similiar to each other and that is a important thing when you have so many characters. If they looked similiar, we would get them mixed. \nThe animations are fluid enough, especially when they are cutting fingers off, because well when it comes to cut fingers off, Baccano excels on it. I'm not kidding, it just looks amazing when someone is cutting someone else's fingers. \nThe pallet used is not that great for me at least. It uses to much black and brown, so the background looks like the same thing even when we have different places. And i think, the stories are not that dark to be painted with only dark colours. The characters are not bright and they don´t have anything to emphasize them from the background. \nThe character are pretty much flat when it comes to coloration. They only have 2-3 colours on their design which make them look bad. But they are well drawn, with a nice facial detail.  \nSound: 7/10. Well the tracks used are not that great. I found some of them boring. Moreover, they get repetitive because the anime doesn´t have a lot of tracks so they always use the same tracks. However, the opening .. what a opening ! I heard it until the end every time. The jazz being one of the main music styles in 1930, is just perfect to use with this anime. Makes up the mood for each episode. The ending is nothing special though. \nCharacter: 8/10. Well, we have a huge cast for only 13 episodes. While in one hand, we need a huge cast for so many plot develop. On the other hand, having such a huge cast means that only a few of them will get develop. Fortunately, they only developed the most interesting characters. \nHere on Baccano you can find everything. Since psychopaths to a guy that cries because of everything. But if there is one character that i would live to talk about, it would be the best couple ever. Acting like only one character, Miria and Isaac just made the comedy of this show without ruining the mood of it ! \nBecause every time, when we have comedy, will definately ruin the mood of the show. Here, i actually enjoyed a lot the comedy, which is something rare because i don´t like comedy. \nThese two characters are just awesome ! They bring hapiness to this anime without making it look bad. Even though they are there only to make comedy, i found them the best characters on this show. \nThe other ones are great as well but not even close to Miria and Isaac. \nEnjoyment: 8/10. Personally, this anime was really funny to watch. Every episode they build up a mistery around the characters and the plot which make the anime much more interesting to watch. \nWhen i finished this anime, i felt tired. What a ride actually. When i stopped to think about how many things happened at the same time i got supressed. I realized how big the plot actually was for 13 eps, and that feeling worth the time spent on this anime. \nOverall: 8/10. I think that this anime deserves a shot. It is funny, interesting and mind blowing when it comes to it's plot. I reccomend it ! \n        "},

One mishap in execution can lead to endless confusion, and it can effectively ruin an entire story!\nBaccano gives no shits, and executes it in flying colors!\nBaccano has a very peculiar way of story telling! It tries to tell many different individual storylines alongside each other, and it does so brilliantly! While each story line may seem incredibly different from each other, Baccano does it in a way where each story line affects the other somehow, and the way they weave them together is brilliant! It may start out a\n          \n        bit confusing, but after you watch a little bit, it starts revealing its secrets in a very satisfying fashion! Each story is packed with excitement, action, thriller, drama, and even humor, and it's almost impossible to get sick of the incredibly refreshing stories. \nWith a great soundtrack, high quality art and animation, superb story telling, a lovable and highly characteristic cast of characters, and thrilling action, Baccano shines in every aspect of the anime world!\nPros:\n- Great and unique story telling, that despite its weird non linear style, is incredibly well executed and thrilling to follow.\n- Amazing cast of characters, including some of the best comedic relief characters ever!\n- Very high quality art and animation, especially for its time. The art pulls no punches and gives everything to you, highlighting the action and the drama!\n- Amazing soundtrack, giving the series some extra class!\n- A great mixture of everything that isn't just a jack of all trades, it excels in everything, like drama, action, comedy, and even some scary moments.\nCons:\n- Story jumps around timelines a lot, some may find it confusing.\n- Some characters don't get enough development compared to the others.\n- Due to the leaps in timelines, some events are repeated during the story (although usually through a different perspective.)\nStory: 9\nThe story is pretty easy to understand and straightforward, but is it really? Like stated before, this story includes many different story lines, all told next to each other. There isn't exactly a \"main story\", although many could argue that the train storyline is the main one, but one could also argue that there is no main story, and that the main plot is just the dangers of 1930s mafia America. Either way, whatever the story is, it was executed brilliantly. The events truly highlighted the life and dangers of that time period, and adding supernatural elements into the mix was also brilliant, especially since superstition still ruled the streets around that time. Combining superstitions that come true into an environment like the 30s was brilliant and it added a lot of thrilling aspects to the story, making it incredibly fun to follow!\nArt: 9\nBaccano doesn't use any fancy artistic art style or animation, it just uses down to earth animation, which supports the story and the atmosphere amazingly. The action scenes are animated as if they were real life action scenes, as there aren't any fancy animations added to their fighting. It's just people shooting or punching each other, no sugar coats or filters added. This gave the show an even more dangerous atmosphere, and truly increased the thrill!\nSound: 9\nFirst of all, I've never skipped the OP of this show. It's so damn catchy, and it really makes this show really classy! The OST of this show also supported the moods of the show very well! During action scenes, the soundtrack would up the thrill and enjoyment. During dramatic moments, it would up the pain and suffering. During comedic moments, it would make Issac and Miria even funnier! Sounds that match the mood of the show and help the show executed its themes even better are what constitute as good sounds! The voice actors/actresses also pull off the incredibly unique characteristics of their characters! I haven't watched the dub, but due to the setting of the show, it has potential!\nCharacter: 10\nThis cast of characters is outrageously awesome. They are so different from each other, with different goals and agendas, as well as completely different characteristics, making them very memorable and identifiable. The characters range from evil and psychopathic, like Ladd Russo and Claire Stanfield, to unemotional like Ennis, to incredibly hilarious and carefree like Issac and Miria. Btw, can we just talk about how awesome Issac and Miria are? Not only are they complete airheads and dunces, but they are incredibly hilarious, caring and nice, and are even a really cute couple! While they are mainly there for comedic relief, they are still irreplaceable!\nEnjoyment: 10\nThis show was just a pure blast to watch! It's got an interesting story, great action, great comedy, gripping drama and gore, and a great depiction of 30s America!\nOverall: 9\nBaccano is a show that takes its themes and executes them incredibly well. It's not perfect at everything, but it is perfect at what it does well. It's something I think that everyone should watch sometime during their anime watching career!\nTL;DR: Now this is the real Rail Wars!\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Baccano! is one of those anime titles that seems a little confusing on the surface, mostly thanks to the overwhelming power of first impressions. That much is something I can definitely understand.\nThe final result, however, is an enjoyable set of interconnected stories where great characterization shines through the virtues of a solid script. \nStory: \nThe plot combines adventure, comedy, mystery, fantasy, action and horror in a very attractive package. Based on a light novel series, the American 1930s and a particular train serve as the primary backdrop for a narrative that manages to be both self-aware of its own nature and surprisingly cohesive, despite the\n          \n        intimidating size of its cast and what first appears to be something of a chronological mess. \nMany initially unrelated events have either important or, at least, incidental connections, with alternatively humorous and tragic consequences. The antics of Isaac and Miria are consistently funny, providing a welcome change of pace from the world surrounding them, which can be dramatic and even explicitly violent without making the contrast seem uneven.\nClearly, there was a lot of thought put into the original script but the animated adaptation's use of time is not simply a gimmick. I even believe that quite a few in-jokes and revelations are, believe it or not, enhanced by this creative decision.\nIt would be very easy for this series to fall apart but there is definitely a method to the madness. When the tale finally ends, the viewer will likely walk away quite satisfied. Baccano! has plenty of memorable scenes and subplots, most of which are resolved in a very satisfying fashion. Those that aren't remain open as doors to further adventures which I'd certainly like to see.\nAnimation:\nGood animation is the norm with a few minor mistakes here and there. The character designs have a nice style and succeed in making most of the cast easily identifiable, one way or another, but it may take some time to tell certain characters apart whenever the quality briefly drops. \nSound:\nA strong set of opening and ending songs, including the animated sequences themselves, does a lot to set the tone. The rest of the Baccano! soundtrack is also quite moody and even refreshing, essentially representing a good range of emotions across the board. Probably one of my favorites.  \nCharacter:\nMuch of the beauty of Baccano! lies in its characters, who aren't just very colorful but also join together to weave a competent narrative that gradually reveals itself to the viewer. From comedic thieves to charismatic madmen to members of the mafia and dark conspirators, you wouldn't be exaggerating too much by stating that this series has it all. \nAside from Isaac and Miria, who are just a lot of fun to watch, I must say that Claire Stanfield is easily my personal choice for a highlight, taking the entire series into consideration and not just any particular arc, although almost any other pick would be equally justified. \nThis is truly an ensemble cast and perhaps one of the few cases in which its sheer size never really makes the whole building stumble. Each character has a convincing personality and their respective development arcs never really drag out too long. Screen time isn't a problem. I would still say that a couple of individuals benefit from being fleshed out during the DVD OVAs, but even in those cases the main TV series has already managed to make them interesting. \nEnjoyment:\nWhile it took me a long time to sit down and watch this series, the experience was almost entirely rewarding and Baccano! has become one of my current favorites. I cannot honestly speak for its replay value just yet, but during my first viewing it was practically impossible to stop. The quality of its characters and storytelling was one reason, but there were a number of exciting cliffhangers, resolved sooner or later though not always immediately, which came at just the right moments. \nIt is certainly a real shame that the rest of the novels haven't received animated adaptations because more Baccano! would be a pleasant surprise, just like the original was.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Overview\nBaccano is a series featuring alchemists, the Italian Mafia, a bloodthirsty vigilante, and a thousand other American pop culture cliches. It is like an American culture cluster bomb exploding in your face! All of this is told in the disjointed style of Pulp Fiction and seems to borrow heavily from Tarantino's awesomely random dialogue and hyper violence. If you love American culture, you will love Baccano. Hell, even you don't you may still love Baccano! This is one charming motherfuckin series!\nStory 9/10\nThe story is essentially a \"frame narrative\", which means it is many different stories all being told by the same character or characters. In\n          \n        this case the gruff yet  hilarious newspaper editor Gustav and his adorable assistant Carol. These 2 narrator's are piecing together a number of unusual events that mostly happened from 1930-1932. Although there is a flashback to the 1700s that explains some plot points later. In 1930, the plot revolves around a batch of elixir that will make the drinker immortal. In 1931, the plot involves a massive bloodbath on a train named the Flying Pussyfoot. Yes, that's really what they named it. In 1932, the plot mostly revolves around a girl's quest to find her missing brother. I will avoid going into further details about these plots in order to avoid spoiling anything. I will say that although many plot points aren't exactly new or creative, the series is pieced together incredibly well and is extremely entertaining to watch unfold. \nCharacters 10/10\nThis is where Baccano really shines! You have the hysterical idiocy of Isaac and Miria, the delightfully entertaining sociopathy of Ladd Russo, and the sheer badassery of Clare Stanfield. There are so many characters, yet pretty much all of them are given depth, back story, and a certain something that makes the viewer simply love them! Even if you happen to not like a particular character or subplot, you won't have to wait long before getting to see someone you do like again. That is one of the aspects of Baccano that works so very well.\nArt 9/10\nThe backgrounds in this anime are incredible and pain staking research actually went into making Grand Central Terminal in New York look as realistic and accurate as possible. The character art is also very well done and the animation captures all that beautiful blood splatter quite well.\nSoundtrack 9/10\nBaccano has one of the best jazz soundtracks in all of anime, with only Cowboy Bebop really exceeding it. Baccano's opening \"Guns and Roses\" ranks among the greatest anime openings of all time. The only thing that could have made the Baccano soundtrack better was to follow the example of \"The Sting\" and include lots of Scott Joplin pieces in the soundtrack. Since Baccano is essentially a giant love letter to American pop culture, how could they have had so many bar scenes set in the 1930s with no Joplin??!\nEnjoyment 10/10\nI really enjoyed pretty much every minute of Baccano! This may not be the deepest or artsiest series to ever exist, but my god is it a lot of fun! My only warning is to aware that the first episode is a bit slow. Once you get past the first episode, you will most likely be hooked. This is one of \"those\" anime that is 13 episodes and the first episode is bafflingly the worst by a substantial margin. A first episode should be one of the best in a given series in order to draw viewers in, but anime like Baccano, Elfen Lied, and a few others seem to defy all logic and  give the viewer their worst first. If you gave up watching Baccano after the first episode, I urge you to reconsider and watch at least 2 more before making a decision.\nOverall 10/10\nIf I somehow failed to make clear that I really like Baccano and I am highly recommending it, then I need to retake writing comp 101. This a unique and fun anime that has something for almost everyone.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Baccano is one of those rare animes, that comes around every now and then then, hooks you until the last episode. Some people (not me) might be turned off for the first couple of episodes, but once it really gets going, you will not want to stop watching.\nStory - The story of Baccano is an interesting one to say the least. It doesn't have a main central story like many other animes. For example, X character has to kill X character because this person murdered his family....As a side note, none of what I just said actually never happens. It is an example :P\nI couldn't\n          \n        really tell the story, without actually giving away what happens.\nArt - I really like this art style and it suits the time period (1930s) really well. It has vibrant colours, but still has that sense of the whole 1930s feel to it. \nSound - The soundtrack for Baccano really suits the time period as it mixes jazz with classical, then it can make transitional changes when an intense scene comes up. \nCharacters - Oh boy, so many characters. There are so many characters in this anime, that you are bound to like one or more, dislike one or more and so forth. So many to choose from. Some different from others. But a couple in particular really bring a comedic, light-hearted feel to this anime. Very likeable and how they get involved is comedic in its own right.\nEnjoyment - As each episode moved on, it kept leaving me for more and more. Has multiple cliffhangers and those are the things that keeped you glued to the screen with your mouth gaped open. \nOverall - I highly recommend this anime to anyone who loves anime and for people who don't as well. Will enjoy it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Titles are important. As much as our culture stresses idioms like “don't judge a book by its cover,” the reality is that the title is usually the first thing we note about any piece of art or entertainment, and it is an element that can quickly turn people away or draw them in. A bit of research will tell us that “baccano” is an Italian word that could be loosely translated as “uproar” or “commotion,” and seldom will you find a title that so perfectly indicates what the content of the work is going to be like. This is a rare case of the cover\n          \n        matching the book perfectly: Baccano! is an action-filled romp in a hilariously Hollywood version of the early 1930s that is uproariously funny and pleasantly confusing.\nBaccano! tells several stories at once. In 1930, an escalating war between a mafia family and a small gang of street toughs is beginning to leave a trail of bodies. In 1931, an attempt by multiple parties to simultaneously hijack a transcontinental train (the “Flying Pussyfoot”) results in utter chaos. In 1932, a young woman races to find her delinquent brother using the services of The Daily Days, a newspaper and underground information dealership who has been attempting to piece the whole mess together. Mixed up in all three of these stories are a group of characters, coined “immortals,” who appear to be incapable of dying.\nThese would be good stories in and of themselves, but Baccano! takes the execution a step further by telling them...well, all at once. With little warning, the series switches between time periods, telling the three stories chronologically, but in bits and pieces. This technique generates instant narrative tension and creates a mystery out a story that would be substantially less exciting if told in a more straightforward fashion. It's enjoyable to mentally puzzle out how the stories are going to fit together, and to see your logically reasoned guesses be destroyed by the complete unpredictability of the show. The result is that Baccano! is undoubtedly confusing, and some people would mark that as a negative right off the bat. However, I feel that there is a marked difference between things which are unintentionally confusing because they're poorly written, and things which are intentionally confusing to create an atmosphere of wonder and evoke curiosity in the viewer. Baccano! is the latter.\nBaccano! is also a masterful example of narrative pacing. The “train” plot, which is the centerpiece of the show, moves at a breakneck speed, while the other plot threads are a little bit slower, and are generally focused on explanation rather than action. These serve as interludes which allow you to draw a breath in between the hectic exchanges of plot-advancing combat and dialogue aboard the Flying Pussyfoot.\nAnother noteworthy aspect of Baccano! is the absolutely massive cast of interesting characters. In many ways, Baccano! is driven completely by the interactions between this cast; every event in every time period seems to be an effect of something that one of the main characters did to another in the past. Baccano! uses a sort of shake-and-bake formula for its characters—take an interesting character concept, add enough of a backstory to explain their relevance to the plot, and then toss them into the fray. It'd be easy to take a cheap shot at the character development (or lack thereof) in the series; there are over twelve main characters, and thirteen episodes in the show, so the math is telling us that there really isn't enough time to give everyone a lot of depth. This fact does rear its ugly head a couple of times, mostly during moments of drama—the characters are just a bit too thin for these moments to come across as anything but corny and out of place. \nHowever, at its core, Baccano! survives on action, comedy, and mystery, and the characters are more than likable enough to carry the show in those regards. It's just plain fun to watch them interact with each other, and most of them are unique enough in concept to excuse their lack of development. To name just a few of my favorites, there's a gang boss who bursts into tears at the drop of the hat, a young woman who giggles with girlish glee as she throws explosives at her enemies, and a pair of blissfully unaware thieves who steal family fortunes to prevent the next of kin from fighting over the inheritance. It's tough to dislike any of the above, and even the biggest hardasses should be able to find a couple members of the cast whose antics they enjoy watching.\nAlthough the main appeal of the series is definitely the likable cast and the twisted storyline, Baccano! doesn't slouch in the technical departments, where a solid art and animation effort by Brains Base brings the whole ordeal to life. The character designs are downright fantastic, consisting of a stylistic mixture of 30s-era gangsters with more traditional anime looks. Everyone looks sufficiently unique to tell apart the huge cast. The animation maintains a smooth feel, even during scenes of rapid motion and insane action (which are plentiful).\nBaccano! is also backed by a solid musical score that always perfectly matches the setting and atmosphere of the show. Most notable are the “big band” songs, which mimic a type of jazz music that was popular in America during the 1920s and 1930s. The chaotic sound of multiple horns and percussion pieces blasting at once perfectly highlights the frantic momentum of the show, particularly during the aforementioned scenes of crazed action. However, the soundtrack does have a lot of range, and it switches to softer piano or string-driven orchestral arrangements as needed; for example, an episode which takes place aboard a ship in 1711 drops the jazz music in favor of the orchestral sounds for a more period-appropriate feel.\nWhen it comes to the voice acting, there's a great effort put forth in both languages, but I think that (surprisingly) the English dub wins by a slight margin in the end. Don't get me wrong, the Japanese cast includes many talented veteran voice actors who are more than capable of getting the job done, but I felt that they were limited by the setting more than anything else. Voice acting is about matching a voice to a character, and no matter how great an individual's performance may be, at the end of the day there's an inherent limit to how well a Japanese voice actor can convince me that they are a 30s-era mobster in New York; try as they might, the Japanese cast simply doesn't seem able to mimic the colloquialisms and speech of the time period. The English cast isn't perfect either, but they seem far more comfortable with the language used. Their interpretation of the cast is a little Hollywood—complete with heavy New York accents, use of terms like “dollface,” and all—but they are able to sound just a little more genuine and comfortable in their roles. In addition, some of the show's humor (particularly the comedic relief of the thieves Isaac and Miria) depends on made-up words, repeated phrases, and simultaneous delivery of lines. It's a lot easier to appreciate these elements in the dub.\nMany times when I feel an anime is great, I find myself ending reviews with terms like “powerful,” “moving,” “thought provoking,” and a variety of others which I use to indicate that the series spoke to me on an intellectual level. Well, none of those words really describe Baccano!, but nonetheless, I feel that it is a great series. Every episode is pure kinetic energy, full of a perfect mix of humor, dark irony, action, and mystery. There was not a minute of it that failed to entertain me, and seldom can a series make such a claim.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Based on how high MAL's mean score is for the majority of shows I can say that Baccano! is pretty underrated even if i'm rating lower than the mean score in this review. I'll explain why.\nStory: 8\nBaccano's story itself is nothing special actually, it has nothing that could surprise you. The difference is made in how the story is told.\nYes, Baccano! has a superb narrative technique that makes this average story extremely entertaining, because that's the best word for Baccano!: entertaining. It's one of the best examples i can put upon the table of \"style over substance\" definition. The three plots the show has are\n          \n        mixed in a perfect way to make them truly entertaining and almost flawless. However, Baccano! has no real deep or true substance behind it. It's just a story full of style and coolness but nothing more. That doesn't mean, of course, that the final product is bad, nothing further than that.\nArt: 9\nThis is 2007 and this art is FREAKING AMAZING, fitting the series pretty well. The animation is almost flawless, although it's not colourful at all. Characters well designed and action scenes so good no doubts. Visual 1930 orgasm even today. Good job, Brain's Base, considering it was their first big work.\nSound: 10\nThis OST, oh god. I've never listen to an OST that could fit better a series. I think that, among with the narrative, this is the point that carries the series so far, making it entertaining, cheerful and bombastic. Voice acting pretty good too, i've watched it with subs but i heard that this is the best anime english dub out there, so i guess you can take a look to the dub version. I think it works well due to the western setting.\nCharacter: 7\nI think this is the biggest flaw of the show. Characters are well-characterized, each one has his own and unique personality (you gotta love Isaac and Miria if you didn't watch it yet) but they are not well developed. Baccano! has a huge cast and it's imposible to develop it nicely in 13 episodes, considering the lack of deep meaning aand substance of the show too. Only the Train plot's characters get some development. However, the majority of the cast is likable and entertaining, and Isaac & Miria carry the series pretty well during the confusing first episodes.\nEnjoyment: 9\nBaccano! is fucking amazing and i enjoyed it as well. It's truly an entertaining masterpiece and you'll probably enjoy as a child.\nOverall: 8\nBaccano! acomplishes its goal very well. It doesn't try to be a mindfuck masterpiece or something that make you think about nothing. It's an average to cool story told in the coolest possible way. I think it's underrated because, being the best example of \"style over substance\" i've watched, it should be rated higher acording to the people that rate about their enjoyment, and this is a masterpiece of enjoyment.\n\"Do you recommend this anime\" Hell yes. I think it's a must watch.\nIf you liked Baccano!, take a look to:\n- Hellsing Ultimate, another entertaining and bombastic show with a darker tone.\n- Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, if you want another show about alchemy, but way more deep, while longer.\n        "},

I try my best to explain and justify my points, but I can’t say for sure whether you’ll be convinced or agree with me. After all, we’re all different. \nThe concept of risk and reward is something that does not rest well with many individuals. More often than not, attempts at originality are stricken down before even given consideration. Innovative ideas are simply looked over and attempts at making them real usually become a laughable matter.  \nSimply put, it’s not even worth\n          \n        the risk. \nIn a society that praises conformity and condemns incompliance, entertainment, as a result, follows this same beaten path. However, every now and then a light of hope shines at the end of the dark tunnel and reveals a masterpiece or innovation worthy of the highest praise. Baccano! does just that with the anime medium.\nStory:\nThe story of Baccano! is essentially four sub-stories, three in prohibition/depression-era America and the other on the rough waves of the Atlantic on board the Advena Avis. In 1930 we learn about the ongoing gang disputes in New York between various families such as the Gandors, Martillos, and the Runoratas. At the same time, alchemist Szilard Quates attempts to perfect the secret formula for an immortality elixir. In 1931, we are aboard the transcontinental train, Flying Pussyfoot, as we experience the conflicts and bloodshed that ensue. In 1932, the gang disputes continue as we also begin to follow young Eve Genoard as well as the staff of Daily Days newspaper in their attempts to find the missing Dallas Genoard. Finally, in 1711, we are aboard the Advena Avis, following a group of alchemists in search of the answer for immortality. \nSounds confusing, doesn’t it?\nLuckily, Narita’s storytelling is eons better than my summarizing, and it’s much better to actually watch the show than to read the brief tidbit of information above. However, what I can do now is provide my insights and opinions on it. \nIn my opinion, the form of storytelling is the first characteristic of innovation that I notice. The story, essentially, is an erratic conglomeration of different scenes from the four different sub-stories arranged in an assumedly random manner. However, it’s much more than that. The placement of the scenes complements the story well, as many scenes seem to cut off straight before the climax, and move onto another scene at a different time. There will seldom be an instance where you completely forget the events of a certain year (1930, ‘31, ‘32,). The one exception to the story is the decision to isolate the events of 1711 into only one episode. Personally, this did not bother me at all, but hey, we’re all entitled to our own opinions. Anyways, what I see that is important about this style of storytelling is that the story itself serves as a medium for character interaction. Essentially, the characters will make the story (I will elaborate in the characters section), and this claim is proven by the omniscient perspective the show boasts. Since the story does not specifically follow the thoughts of one character, you are exposed to the full picture, something that I appreciated greatly as the show progressed. \nAddressing misconceptions and complaints about the story, the one thing that I hear all too often is that there is no pattern to the story. Some say the random throwing together of scenes is lackluster and the constant scene cutoffs only serve as a reason to continue watching the show. Although one can take it like that at face value, what is often missed is the thematic significance of the storytelling medium. The title itself gives it away; Baccano! means racket or rowdiness in Italian (google translate to the rescue). And boy does the story give off those vibes. Critics will often dismiss this fact and stick to the basics. If the storytelling does not follow form A or form B…or form Z it is thus not worthy of being a story at all. This unhealthy obsession with such conformity takes away the true meaning of the story’s purpose: to simply have fun with it, as you would enjoy the ride of a roller coaster. Like a roller coaster, Baccano’s story has its slower, faster, and crazier moments, but in the end, you always get back to where you started, but with a new perspective on things. Trust me, if you go in all rigid and analytical (like I did in the beginning), you won’t have much fun. What Brains Base’s adaptation along with Narita’s original work does is immerse you into the world, and all you have to do is sit back and enjoy. \nStory: 10/10\nArt: \nThe best word I can use to describe the art in Baccano! is “fitting.” The prohibition/depression era settings and characters provide the viewer with a certain “30’s” ambiance. The streets and buildings are rough and rigid and the characters are clad with suits and fedoras. This certain atmosphere Brains Base brings to life not only enhances the viewing performance, but also immerses the viewer into the scene. The smoke-laden rooms, the rough night at sea, and the dim city atmosphere are all examples of ways the art-style complements the show itself. Each character that plays an important role is designed with his or her personality in mind. With the exception of Nice, Jacuzzi, and Donnie(or Donny, whatever), character designs are rather believable and are not pains to have to look at every episode. (not saying that Nice and Jacuzzi have bad character designs, they just don’t really fit the era, but that can be explained by backstory)\nAnimation quality is crisp and clean. Fighting scenes are done particularly well and are always a blast to watch. Additionally, this show is a bloody one. Graphic violence is relatively common and Brains Base finds rather imaginative ways of portraying this. Basically, this show is not for the faint of heart. Unfortunately, that’s about all the art and animation in Baccano! can muster. Overall, they are both great; however, some qualities such as the immortal regeneration and other moments of lack of attention bring the artistic rating of Baccano! down. Nonetheless, it is still “fitting.”\nArt: 9/10\nSound:\nOther than Cowboy Bebop, who would’ve thought that jazz and anime could go so well together? However, the soundtrack is not stuck with jazz alone. Several other tracks may be a simple piano tune or just feel like an authentic western. It’s surprising to see a soundtrack that pays so much attention to detail these days. Most soundtracks often focus on one theme and build upon it. This usually results in a lack of variety; however, Baccano’s soundtrack is chock-full of all sorts of tunes fit for each and every scene that transpires throughout the story. The whole OST just screams “authentic,” whether it actually is or not, beats me, but I am still a big fan of it. \nThe opening, Gun’s & Roses by Paradise Lunch, is an extremely catchy jazz tune that, with my limited knowledge of jazz, is probably some sort of adaption of a 30’s swing jazz tune, since it focuses more on an ensemble of brass to play in unison rather than focus on the solo/improv style of the bop jazz of the 50’s(it’s also too upbeat to be blues too). This is great because they provide a well-done piece that is both catchy and relatively accurate.\nThe ending, Calling by Oda Kaori, is a soothing piece that is reminiscent of a love song or ballad or something along those lines. Arguably out of place, the song is still a great one that I find as a little breathe of fresh air after all of the pandemonium of the episode. \nThe only word I can use to describe the voice acting of Baccano! is immaculate, simply immaculate. The voice crew was arguably one of the best ever assembled. In all of the anime that I have watched so far, very few have done as well as the Baccano! cast. This is one of the shows where you can hear the VA play his or her character and sound like he or she is genuinely having a good time. From the elated “SUGOI!”’s of Miria Harvent to the sadistic jargon of Ladd Russo, each voice was a close to perfect rendition of each respective character’s personality. \nAs a whole, the sound set of Baccano! is close to that of a masterpiece. The one lacking factor that nags me is the lack of any standout tracks that are not simply jazz that involves all of the brass. My only complaint would be that and that simply to get a 10 out of music from me, I have to literally enjoy listening to every single piece in the OST as well as the opening and endings too (I think only guilty crown and ikoku meiro no croisee have done that so far considering my musical taste)\nSound: 9.5/10  \nCharacters:\nWhat can I say other than greatness? The characters in Baccano! are not only full of life and character, but also watching their interactions and experiences is interesting to boot. Unlike most other anime, I had almost no problem learning the names and characteristics of each and every character within a few episodes(and there’s like a lot of them, A LOT). Now this may not be the same for everyone, but in general, the execution of story progression coupled with the unique personalities and appearances of each character makes this cast one in a million. From the calm, cool, and collected demeanor of Luck Gandor to the poor fretful soul that is Jacuzzi Splot, each character, though not really developed, plays his or her role in the story to perfection. The sheer variety of the cast does not stop there. Whether displaying the characteristics of your typical serial murderer (ya I know that sounded weird) or of your organized gang leaders, Baccano! has just about everything to offer from it’s absolutely colorful cast. \nNow you may be wondering, didn’t I say the storytelling was the “first” instance of innovation/masterful execution? That means there should be another instance too. Well here we are. The last aspect that differentiates this show’s characters from the others is in the form of our odd couple, Isaac Dian and Miria Harvent. Simply put, these characters are quite literally bundles of joy. \nOverly ecstatic? \nYes. \nOverly optimistic?\nYes.\nPretty darn annoying?\nYes.\nBut in the end, they are the glue that sticks the story all together. They are the finishing pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. Without them, the show simply would not be the same. The characteristics of Isaac and Miria are simple, and that is the beautiful thing. Narita finds no reason to delve into their past, no reason to develop their characters, and no reason to provide any sort of unnecessary twists and turns to their personalities. Their design is pure and untouched. Of course you can draw correlations between these two and other couples in entertainment history; however, few couples have done it with such elation. Their presence is an absolute joy to experience, and their contributions to story are undeniable.\nLooking back at the characters, there’s not much to nag about in my own opinion. Some may find some characters to be lacking, hateful, or underdeveloped; however, the great thing about these arguments is that it’s something completely open for debate. There is definitely a chance that you may not like many of the characters, but with a cast this big, chances are you’ll find some to love, and this love might grow and spread to the others eventually too. \nCharacters: 10/10\nEnjoyment:\nEnjoyment is always the most arbitrary category in any review. Each individual has his or her own unique checklist of “what makes this show enjoyable.” Personally, everything on this checklist was complete. \nMore often than not, I find myself having some bad habits when I watch anime nowadays. I usually have a sort of “pre-rating” in my mind as I calculate all of the positives and negatives to come up with a suitable score. As a result, I often lose that sense of enjoyment I’m supposed to get from watching anime. Whether it’s that or if I am constantly looking at how many minutes are left until the episode is over, there are often reasons that hinder my enjoyment of a series. \nThankfully, Baccano! alleviated me of this nagging pain.  I can genuinely say that this is probably only the 2nd or 3rd series that I have ever watched where I was simply so immersed with character interactions, story, and having a good time that I forgot about all of these small details that usually plague my mind as I watch. From the catchy opening to the “What’s next on Baccano!” at the end of every episode, I had a blast the whole time.\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nOverall:\nWords can't even begin to describe the ride that I was absolutely privileged to experience. Baccano! delivers in every aspect, from a large, full of character cast to an enticing story, complimented by fitting art and a catchy soundtrack. Those 13 episodes couldn't have flown by faster.\nOverall: 9.7/10 \n"},

I didn't really do any research on the anime, and none of my friends really knew what the series was. The only thing I really knew was that the art looked interesting, and everywhere I looked in the forums, I could see people that said, \"Watch this series!\". So, I decided to give Baccano! a look.\nIn the first few minutes, I didn't think that the anime was going to be much. For a while, you saw a little girl and an older man talking to each other about some story that happened earlier.\n          \n        I was a bit worried that all Baccano! was going to be was these two characters talking back and forth about the series. Pretty soon, I realized that I was mistaken and there was more that was offered than just these two characters. Soon, names, places, and years because to pass and I started watching with a great intent.\nStory wise, Baccano! spares no expense giving a gory, yet interesting story with enough drama, action, and comedy to keep most fans occupied. I was very impressed with how balanced the series really was. The way the story was presented was unique as well, but it does take a while to get use to. By the end, it's easy to get a hang of the presentation, and the story really makes sense. Most of the questions are answered by the end of the series.\nAlong with the story was the large library of characters, who were all as unique as the presentation. Normally, I would avoid an anime with a lot of characters. They're often hard to keep track of. With Baccano!, keeping track of the characters was rather easy (much easier than I thought it would be), and the characters were actually interesting to keep up with. With such a large selection, choosing a favorite character can either be simple or very difficult. From Isaac and Miria, a pair of idiotic robbers that stole to help everyone else, to Ladd Russo, a serial killer with a passion for murdering people in a bloody matter (especially if those people thought they were safe), to Firo, a gangster with a longing to help and save the people that mean the most to him, there's unlimited characters, drama, and suspense to keep a fan entertained for hours. It's easy to tell that the creators spared no expense making the characters exactly as they wanted them.\nAnother thing that helped the series is the wonderful art. Unlike most brightly colored, distorted anime, Baccano! holds its head high for having original, darker art that really works well for the series. Since the story takes place during the 1930's, the costumes, colors, and setting really help make the world. The selection of art created a very realistic setting for all of the characters and situations and helped build the 1930's world the creators were looking for. Almost every detail was spot on for the art. Plus, the art was very appealing to the eyes. There was nothing too flashy or out of place within the series.\nOne of the best things, I think, about Baccano! is the music. Never have I heard a soundtrack for an anime that I wanted so badly. Even the opening and closing themes are great, and the music really does help bring certain situations alive. What is a good fight scene without dramatic music? Baccano! not only brings that music, the music is also places perfectly in the scenes, and it fits the time of the anime. The swing type music brings the era alive and helps the 1930's feel of the show better than any entertainment about the 1930's I've seen.\nTo say that I enjoyed Baccano! would be an understatement. I adored Baccano! with every fiber of my body and I would recommend the series to anyone that's looking for something different, unique, and loves a little blood with their characters, story, and entertainment.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=15,   ["text"]="                          \n    Fast paced, funny and stylish, \"Baccano\" is a gem of an anime that simply oozes class from every pore. It's an anime that will satisfy critics and mainstream audiences alike, a hugely enjoyable series that sets off like a rocket and doesn't stop till the end.\nBut what is \"Baccano\" exactly? Kinda hard to describe. I guess the best I can come up with is that it's a whacky adventure that's both funny and violent - often at the same time - and contains elements of mystery and intrigue. First thing to note is its highly non-linear story telling method. The main bulk of the anime\n          \n        takes place in three different years that are told in parallel. Focus often skips from one time line to another to keep things interesting. Although initially I found this gimmicky way of telling the story to be quite fresh and entertaining, I do think it gets a little tiring after like the 56th change in a single episode. The extremely fragmented storyline means that it takes a while before you can get an idea of where it's going. However, despite the fragmented and non-linear nature of the story telling, it's actually surprisingly easy to keep track of what's going on. I suspect that a lot of this is down to the fact that when a new scene joins onto a scene that has already been shown previously, the overlap is just a bit longer than the ones you tend to get with other non-linear shows, and this extra bit of reminder is often just long enough to coax out from your memory what happened before. It's a fantastic feat to achieve this kind of clarity in this type of show. \n\"Baccano\" is primary about entertainment, and entertain it does. It has a fantastic sense of humour that's somewhat over the top but not annoyingly so, and it delivers plenty of laugh-out-loud moments. It's also a rather violent show. Looking at the light hearted comedy, you would never have guessed how bloody it is in places. The stark contrast between the happy-go-lucky-style and the violence is slightly reminiscent of Tarantino's movies, and in fact nothing encapsulates this feel better than the dissonant scene where the sadistic Ladd Russo cheerfully beats a man to death with his bare fists, grinning all the while as the blood splatters onto his own face and clothes. Ladd Russo is a delightful character who breathes fresh life into the rather stale psychotic villain mould. His constant jovial mood is always accompanied by a sinister aura, and this contrast makes him a scary but strangely compelling character. In fact Ladd Russo made such an impression on me that since I watched \"Baccano\", I'm now readily able to identify the characters played by his voice actor - he's been in a surprising number of anime (Maes Hughes from the FMA franchise, the music critic Manabu Sakuma from \"Nodame Cantabile\" to name a couple), I just hadn't noticed it until now.\nLadd Russo is not the only great character, and in fact \"Baccano\" is blessed with an extremely large number of fabulously diverse and colourful personalities. My other favourites include Issac and Miria, who are a pair of wonderfully entertaining thieves who seem to be in the story for no purpose other than clown around continuously... but considering how good they are at doing it, I wouldn't really want it to be any other way. But although most of the characters in \"Baccano\" are pretty interesting, it is a bit guilty of having *too* many characters, as there are a few don't really make much of a splash and aren't very memorable in any way, and took up screen time that could have been given to more interesting characters like Firo.\nI also found the way everything is wrapped up to be a little disappointing. Part of this is probably because it's so much fun watching \"Baccano\" unravel its plot with delightful eccentricity that the ending feels very plain and anti-climatic in comparison. There is no shocking last minute twists or anything particularly clever etc, everything is resolved rather conveniently and I was left feeling like I just watched a magician who's finally run out of tricks at the end of a performance. Still, it's a very small complaint to make when you consider how spectacular and enjoyable the rest of the show is.\n        "},

I really enjoyed this anime, even if I only picked it up to pass the time and because I heard it had a nice ant-hero (it does), and I ended up really loving it. In fact, it's probably one of my favourites. The story is interesting, intriguing, and pulls you right in. I will admit, it does skip between \"chapters\" quite often, going from one story to the other within a single episode. It can be confusing at times, and it mixes\n          \n        in unrealistic occurrances with real ones to pull in the viewer. The artwork is wonderful and very tasteful, considering the sound, characters, and story, and really sets the mood for anyone watching. The sound is equally great, and gives you the feel of the anime's main time period. It's almost all instrumental, and it's all the kind of material you'd listen to over and over again. Kind of reminds me of Cowboy Bebop in a way. The characters are all likable, both good and bad. I swear they all need professional help, but they're all very enjoyable, nonetheless. They have been through things and go through things as the story progresses, and you'll always find the good within the bad, and yet, the opposite is true as well. Some characters you will hate, though, I assure you. Like I said before, I really enjoyed this anime, and I still want more episodes (it's obviously over). If you plan on watching this anime, you must watch the O.V.A. as well, as it has the ending, so I highly recommend those as well. I loved this anime, and I'm sure lots of others will too. \n        "},

The story doesn't center around just one character which is good, you get multiple aspects of other characters that eventually cross paths in the story.\nStory: Unfortunately I didn't think it did enough to tell the story like the manga has but I can't expect much with so few episodes as the anime had. The story did well to blend with the era of America it was set in and another era far back before the main story line was taking place.\n          \n        Explanations of certain characters back stories were short but informative enough and the fact the anime didn't dwell to much on one character is something I appreciated. In a story I like getting multiple perspectives through the eyes of other characters because every story has a version of it through the eyes of different characters that have experienced it. Alchemy is a part of the story but it isn't touched on to much. \nArt: I do like the style but some animation scenes did seem a bit rushed at times. Design fitted the era it was set in pretty well and even in the short flashback from a much farther era in history the design was fitting for that era as well. Mobsters, and general swing era clothing was pretty close to what it was like during that decade.\nSound: I love swing and jazz era music, and the OST is amazing one of my favorites to ever come from a anime sometimes I listen to it in my spare time. It was used perfectly with every scene in the anime and never seemed to not fit with the events through out the story and it seemed different characters sometimes had a different tune to follow suit with them any time you would see the story through their perspective.\nCharacters: Characters for the most part were well done, even ones that had short lived roles had at least some development to them. The anime's perspectives were mostly unique through each group of characters with their own perspectives through out the story. Many memorable ones and most seemed different from one another and not just copypastes of other characters.\nThis is a good anime to watch if you like the era in America it is set in and if you have a niche enjoyment of stories involving the mafia.\n        "},

I just want to say my opinion about Baccano!\nTo say Baccano! is an anime that stands out as one of greatest plot ever is not exaggerating. The plots generally divided into three time settings, 1930, 1931, 1932. At first episodes things didn't seem to connect well. The bunch of characters were confusing me and the gang factions thingy didn't help at all. If you happen to feel the same way I did, just stay watching, because it gets better each episodes. The way they execute it is just so good. It is\n          \n        probably one of reasons why people like it. I guess Baccano! wouldn't get receptions this good if not because the great plots execution.\nAbout the character.. Hmm, what do I say? They all are unique in some ways. We have Isaac and Miria, a cheerful ignorant duo that doesn't seem to know what's going on around them. There are some your typical joker-psychopathic guy, a coward, and whole lot more. I regret how some characters don't give good progression, for example Czeslaw Meyer, and some are out of place (Lua Klein), but never everything goes perfect. \nThe art is incredibly consistent. We get to see the real depictions of dawn 20th century of US and I could say Aniplex did a good job at this. And for the BGM, nothing special. Although I jam the OP every time, but besides that, I think it's okay.\nTo conclude all, Baccano! is a fun ride filled with convoluted plots that has its charms. It's not a perfect one, mostly because the glorification of violence yet tame story, but I can assure you it's one of the greatest anime there is.\n        "},

Passengers include Mrs. Mary Beriam, wife of an Important Senator, her daughter, Mary, and some kid they know named Czeslaw. The problem is that almost everyone on the Train seems to want to kill someone. The Lemure cult, led by the currently incarcerated Huey Laforet, who seems to be Immortal, want to take the passengers, namely the Beriams, hostage, in order for their leader to be released.

He's an all around good guy, but when he finds out that Immortality is involved heavily in his life, some pretty weird things start happening. Um, actually, no, that's not really what happens. The year is 1932, and the young Miss Eve Genoard searches for her brother Dallas. Unfortunately, in order to do this, she has to become involved with the Mafia.

The Music, though, is so brilliant it almost glows. The Theme song, Gun's and Roses is so fitting, and yet so cheerful. It's was stuck in my head the first time I saw it, and yet that wasn't bad at all.

By forcing the viewer to piece together the events and happenings of the story, the viewer becomes part of the story, an investigator of sorts, making connections and using context clues and events to put the story together. Not to mention the plot twists, various scenes of action, and brief pauses that make one yearn for more, Baccano leaves the viewer always on his or her tip-toes, completely unsure and uncertain about what the future may bring.\nThe storytelling is excellent. I cannot stress this enough, the events, though seemingly random at first, slowly develop into this bigger picture sort of scenario; and every scene matters. I know many will probably give up on the first episodes because, trust me, it's really confusing and makes you want to give up easily. But I stuck through it, and I don't regret it. The story itself is interesting, because you have the least possible amount of information to understand what's going on. It's up to YOU to understand it. That's what made this anime so interesting, and really hard not to watch in one sitting, because you always want to know what happens next. Every detail, every little scruple and piece of information must be disseminated and unencrypted, for future use. \nThe art is stunning; the attention to detail exquisite. The scenes are smooth and flawless, the ominous colors foreshadowing future events, the eyes widening, etc etc. The faces and bodies are also drawn more accurately than most other anime I've watched - the proportions look right, the face detail is perfect, and, of course, the clothing reflects early 1900s America. Most of the characters wore suits, making the anime have an aura of sophistication and seriousness. \nThe sound is similarly impressive and enjoyable. I hummed the tune whenever it played in the background. It's jazzy and bouncy, once again reflecting the culture of Great Depression America. I loved the way the music crescendoed up and up during suspenseful parts, just like a movie, or during certain ominous parts the music became slow and intense. The music fit the mood and tone just right every single time. \nLastly, the characters. There were so many different kinds of personalities and characters with different traits that made the story seem more real. The characters' interactions were interesting, considering their differing backgrounds and dispositions. There was one particular couple of paradoxical nature that made me chortle incessantly throughout the whole anime. They made the mood lighter than it should have been, and added a touch of humor when it was desperately needed. There were no main characters, really; and the anime does a great job telling why there shouldn't be. The story does revolve around a train, the Flying Pussyfoot, that seems more of a joke than anything else. But the events that lead up to such a train ride make the Flying Pussyfoot seem more real and terrible than first understood.\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. There were no fillers at all, and each of the 13 episodes were essential to understanding the plot. The characters were far beyond normal - then again, these were far more abnormal circumstances. The suspense was almost tangible, and it left you on the edge of your seat, gripping the cushion harder and harder. After all, everyone must die. \n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    Hi, this is my first review in MAL, english is not my native language so please try to understand.\nBaccano! is a very popular anime among the american anime fans, why? because its based in certain period in american history, the Prohibition Era, a period many people finds interesting but i don't like because movies or series based in that period usually look way too sad and melancholic, always the same colours, always the same kind of music, always involves mafias, etc.\nIf you are a person who likes series that are different and have an unique narrative style you are going to like Baccano! a lot,\n          \n        the story is about italian gangsters, thugs, alchemists, monsters and immortals, Baccano says about itself it doesn't have a beginning or an end, but... i disagree!!, the story begins in 1711 when a group of alchemists find the secret of eternal life, and the end of the series is very clear too.\nFor me different doesnt mean automatically good, Baccano is different, just that, i cant really find characters interesting or outstanding, they lack development maybe except for one girl but that girl has like zero personality, and Isaac and Miria the favourites of a lot of people are just used to lower the tension of some moments, the fact Baccano only has 16 episodes doesnt mean the characters cant evolve, plus their personalities or the way they react to certain situations is by no means realistic or interesting, i cant really understand people when they talk about the charisma of these characters i can be sure im gonna forget all of them in like 2-3 years.\nThe design of the characters is good, they look nice, but the animation is one of the worse ive seen in my life, there's a moment in episode 3 when this guy (Firo) literally dissapears, that made me laugh, hell it was mediocre and pathetic but funny, Baccano has a lot of fights, action and blood so the animation should be A LOT better. I usually dont let bad animations influence the score i give to an anime but i want to be honest, the music is good but its forgettable, except for the Opening: Gun's & Roses by Paradise lunch which is amazing, truly amazing.\nThe structure in this anime is interesting and very good but there are a lot of coincidences and the characters are boring AF, they are the way they are just because \"fuck yeah\" but well thats what happens when you put 14 Main characters in a 13 episodes series. About the 3 OVAS being fully honest they shouldn't even exist but ok. \nTo finish i would say Baccano! is the anime you are looking for if you are an \"anime fan\" who hates anime, i rate it 6.8/10 i dont feel like i got treasurable memories from this anime.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Baccano is simply fun.  Their are very few shows that can get away with this and yet still be structurally solid and maintain strong characters. I have seen far to many shows that i have also labled as fun that suffer from the same things that appear to be Baccanoes greatest strengths. However I don't think at first glance Baccanoes strengths can be seen. Its one of those shows that you have to finish to appreciate or even understand certain plot points. \nStory\nI honestly feel that Baccono has a highly unique way of portraying and moving its plot. That result of the events you\n          \n        see is shown to you by episode one however this is one of those shows where you have zero context into the world and a better part of the show is spent getting your feet grounded. But its in this feet grounding that you come to enjoy the show. You spend so long trying  to figure out whats happening that you cna become kind of lost. This blast of fun is also Baccono showing you its greatest weakness. It has no clue how its pacing can hurt a viewers interest. If you are like me you really become swept up in the madness and as such your suspension of disbelief is there to begin with. However if you don't buy into this same strength the show really does die to begin with as it drags you through its thirteen episode series.  However when the plot really kicks in it difficult not to feel the fun and wacky characters as they manipulate the plot. Baccono simply is the character driven narrative done well.\nChraracters \nAs a memtioned beofre Baccano is about characters driving the story. Plot doesn't really happen to our characters but the characters create the plot. With no real main protagonist we really get  to watch as our countless characters really take over and live within the setting. The 20s were a wild time and out characters fit that. From mob bosses to immortals we really get to see a truly dynamic cast. Its characters relationships that drive the narrative. This creates a issue becuase if you don't care for these characters then the plot is ridiculous and the story flounders. Baccano is quite simply a show that hopes that you buy in because it really has no other place but to shine if that happens. \nSound/ Animation\nIm not really a big sound amd animation guy. In all honestly ua long as it isn't terrible i cna put up with it. But Baccano shines here as well with clean character desgins that a farly memorable and smooth fantastic animation. The dub is probably one of the best dubs i have ever heard and if you like dub this is the prefered way of watching. If you don't its still solid. Nothing to complain about here\nEnjoyment \nPersonal enjoyment can only be a score up two because its clouds the objective reality of how strong the show is outside of me asa person. And because i was caught up in the world of Baccano (Firo is my bae). This passes with flying colors.\nQuite simply Baccano is fantastically fun and fanatically exicting hence why i would give it a 9/10\n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="                          \n    Baccano is a 13-episode anime series based off a series of light novels. It's set in 1930s America. For a Japanese production, it feels very, well, American. I just finished watching the English dub and I found it to be very entertaining.\nStory: There's actually 3 storylines going on at once: a 1930 arc, a 1931 arc, and a 1932 arc. They're basically all about various gangs trying to gain control of an elixir that can grant immortality. The show frequently jumps back an forth between the three stories, and the series starts in medias res. Because of this, it's rather hard to follow on your\n          \n        first viewing, but by episode 4 or 5, you should figure out what's going on by then. The 1930 arc is the best in my opinion. 8/10.\nArt: The overall quality of the art and animation is pretty good. I couldn't find any off-model shots in the series. The character designs aren't some of the best I've seen, but they're not terrible, either. The backgrounds look pretty good. In short, good enough for me. 8/10.\nSound: Most of the background music sounds like American music from the 1920s; it all sounds good. I like the opening theme song, too.\nOnce again, I only saw this in English, but my word, the Funimation version of Baccano has some of the best voice-acting I've ever heard in my life. Unlike most dubs, most of the characters don't speak in neutral Midwestern American accents. It's set in New York, so most characters have New Yorker accents. Some of the accents are exaggerated, but they all fit their characters, and there is not a single weak link in the entire cast. It's a delight just to hear the characters speak. If the music was better, this would easily get a ten. 9/10.\nCharacterization: Really good, actually. There's quite a few named characters, but by the end, you'll know who's who. Some of the characters are absolutely brutal, while others are tough but kind at the same time. My personal favorite characters are Firo (for being way cool and having the best performance I've heard from Todd Haberkorn yet) and Ladd Russo (for being a violent sociopath who sounds like Bender from Futurama). Most people seem to like Isaac and Miria the most; they are hilarious. This is really the best thing about Bacanno; everyone comes to like at least a few characters. 9/10.\nEnjoyment: Don't expect anything deep from this show. It's really just about gangland conflicts and an elixir of immortality, with a silly Bonnie-and-Clyde couple thrown in for good measure. It's a throwback to the gangster films of old, and a time when everyone wore hats, smoked cigarettes, and did drive-by shootings with Tommy guns. But if you don't mind seeing a tribute to the age of Prohibition-era criminals, (albeit one with intense graphic violence and a drink that can make people invincible) go for it. You won't be disappointed. 8/10.\nThere is also a 3-episode OVA, which is just as good as the 13-episode series, and I know that the anime version of Baccano has just scratched the surface of the content from the light novels. I wouldn't mind seeing more animated adaptations of this series.\n        "},

I'd probly say this anime is for people that have started allready with anime like for moderate watchers cuse its a lil short which is sad because it holds alot of interest by the storyline and another good anime that you could follow this up after watching could be durarara!! which has started a while\n          \n        ago and is only up to like the 9th ep\" - Redhydoken7\n\"Why is this anime so popular and what about it do you think makes it a great anime? Or do you not even think it is a great anime? What about the characters do you like or not like? Do you think this anime should be for beginners or should they avoid it? Should it be for more experienced anime watchers instead? Is it one of those \"essential\" anime that everyone needs to see? Was it confusing for you? Is it one of those overrated anime? Or is it one of few the recent anime that have potential to become a classic?\nI'm not all too sure why it is popular but I think it's because it's different and breaks a lot of the cliche of anime in all types of ways, in particular characters and the way it is told. I remember reading a review and someone saying that Baccano! was one of the animes which reformed all your prejudices about types of story telling. I pretty much liked all the characters, they all had their merits. I don't know why beginners shouldn't watch it, it'll give them a good idea of what potential anime can have (something that nearly got to me when I first started watching anime, as a lot of it was so cliched). I think in one way it's an essential anime to see since it's on so many people's top 5. I think personally it will become classic especially since the series Durarara!! has been a potential watch for so many after seeing Baccano! Admittedly, I have yet to meet someone who didn't like this anime. So if anyone is willing to prove me wrong I'd be interested to hear why...\" - Toast-Junkie\n\"A large cast of characters packed full of personality\nEach with their own backstory (albeit some weren't delved into deeply)\nA piecing together of the story which leaves you with a brain orgasm upon the conclusion\nHighly original in style and atmosphere\nFine blending of Comedy and Gore in to the story\nAll formulae for win\nI think it's a great anime, but it's not \"for beginners\" and hence, it's not essential. To be enjoyed, this anime requires people to persist in watching it until the end.\" - dxthegreat\n\"I watched Baccano a few months ago and I really enjoyed it, the epic plot, the unique mixture of characters, the way the storyline mixes together from different perspectives...\nTop anime, a must watch for all\" - finis\n\"As others have mentioned, the story is amazing. The way it's assembled piece by piece is just spectacular. The characters are likeable on the whole as well. An excellent anime.\" - CriticalEye\n\"To be honest, Baccano was an anime I had left on my to-watch list for a very long time. Why? I watched th first episode and simply couldn't make any sense of what the was going on in there. But yes, it got me hooked immediately after i started, and i marathoned it in one night.\nAs many have said, Baccano isn't your typical anime. Its a masterpiece in how it manages to mesh together various aspects you wouldn't aspect to go together into a simple yet engaging storyline. Yet, the way its assembled piece by piece turns it into a mystery thriller of sorts, leaving you guessing till the very end. Of course, it manages to break many of the cliches in anime, with unique and fun characters than all pull you along in their own right. All this, achieved in the short span of 13 episodes. I gave it a 10, and i can count the number of animes i gave 9 on one hand. A funny little anime, yet a definite must-watch.\" - Pressit\n\"The good: Interesting story-telling, great range of characters, mind-boggling monolouges, great comedical and action\nThe bad: fail attempts to create suspense (esp in Eve Genoard scenes), plot holes (in the Firo scenes) that are buried within the 'time jumps'\" - Vin-nii\n\"I think Baccano is so great because it's idea is original and humor is awesome. It's a bit disturbing at times and plainly impossible to understand until the end what makes it a surprise\" - sintra\n\"For me Baccano! is great anime. Story are very interesting, and was told in unusual way, characters are unique, and music is just awesome ^^\nAnd even if I though a lot during watching it how it can end, ending was still big suprise for me :)\" - InezMaria\n\"I love the wide range of characters. The plot's meh, but the way the anime told it is was awesome XD The first episode was much more than a mayhem, and kinda discouraged me to continue it, but I was glad I did. All the blood and them immortals and Isaac and Miria, and not to mention the Rail Tracer too XD they're a bunch of badasses. It's definitely one unique--no, more than unique--animu.\" - Wetpantsu\n\"a quentin tarantino style storytelling,which made a good story even more suspenseful.great mixture of horror and comedy.many totally different characters,yet each with a developed backstory(some with more of a backstory,some with less,but it's always present).and all that in just 13 eps?i think that's enough said.it will stay on my top 5 for a long,long time...\" - TTst\nWe hope you have found this review useful!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    OK everyone, this is my first ever anime review on this website, I just want to let that out there. I also want you to know that I am not a big anime fan. I only got into the medium early this year and have only watched about 8-10 actual anime series.\nThat being said, after the small amount of content I've witnessed from this medium, I can safely say that I have been SEVERELY missing out on absolutely amazing shows. And today, I'm going to talk about an anime that has quickly become one of my favourites after finishing it.\nBaccano! is amazing. In every sense\n          \n        of the word. And right here I shall explain why.\nNow this is usually the part of a review where they talk about the overall plot and what the show is about, but with Baccano!, that is very difficult to do. There are loads of different stories, plots and characters going on in different time periods but also at the same time... The overall story of this show is very confusing at first because of the constant time jumps and the TONS of characters that are set up in the INTRO ALONE let alone the rest of the series. It can be very disorienting for newcomers and could turn them off from the series in general...\nBut if you stick with the series you get used to it and you're greeted to an absolutely amazing story with loads of plot twists and turns. \nThe setting of the show is the 1930s, so obviously there's going to be loads of stories to do with gangs, mafias, crime lords, all that good stuff. But it also gets into stuff WAY more complicated than that like immortality, insanity and even love. Overall, it's a great story that really gets you hooked as long as you stick with it.\nNow for the characters...\nOH LORD THE CHARACTERS!\nThey are some of the most entertaining characters I have ever seen in a TV show, let alone an anime! From Jacuzzi Splot, the wimp with a brave heart, Ladd Russo, the complete psychopath who knows it and loves it, to even Chane Leforet, the silent assassin. You would think that a series with this many characters would find it difficult to make them all unique and memorable but Baccono! freaking did it.\nAnd of course you have without a doubt the best characters of the show, Isaac and Miria. These two are absolutely amazing. They're both funny, well meaning and have the best chemistry out of all the characters in the series in my opinion. You can just tell these two love each other and the voice actors (at least in the English dub) pull it off remarkably well.\nSpeaking of the voice actors, onto the presentation. The animation for this show is very good, but nothing really stands out about it to me personally.  That is except, of course, the gore. Did I mention that this series is very violent and graphic? Seriously, this show is not appropriate for children in anyway. Don't believe me? Well, here's a little example. (And if you're wondering, I don't think this is a spoiler because it happens in the first minutes of the first episode)\nThere is literally a scene where a ten year old boy gets shot in the head with a shot gun.\nNo really.\nThe animation and gore isn't the only good thing about the presentation, the soundtrack is also amazing. The opening theme is incredibly energetic and catchy, the themes themselves are great and everything has an incredibly jazzy 1930s feel to it, which is very appropriate as that's when the show is set. The only thing I don't really like about the soundtrack is the ending theme. I don't know why but it just never clicked with me. Maybe because I think that a girl singing and piano music doesn't mesh with the rest of the music or that it belongs in another anime, I don't really know. But aside from that, an outstanding soundtrack.\nNow, many people may dislike me for saying this but I usually watch amines in the English dub. I just find it easier to connect to the characters of the show if they're speaking my language. Luckily for me, the dub in Baccano! is very good. All the characters sound as they should and no one's voices feel out of place in my opinion. Then again, I've never once listened to the Japanese dub so maybe that is a lot better than the dub, but I don't know that right now anyway.\nOverall, Baccano! is an absolutely fantastic show. The characters are amazing, the gore is incredibly creative as well as shocking, the soundtrack is awesome and the story, while being very confusing at the start, becomes better and better as the series goes on. Any flaws I have with show are so minor you could see them with a magnifying glass. \nIf you haven't seen this anime yet, SEE IT! Trust me, you will not regret it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Baccano!, with its bevy of a cast and three story lines from three different time periods, all crammed into thirteen episodes, where do I begin? Actually, this question is asked by the show itself in the first episode, where it is then discussed. It is a careful introduction; lots of talking, a little bit slow.\nBut come episode two, it picks up and never slows down, expanding on these stories and characters, weaving the threads in and out until it all culminates into an explosive ending where everything comes together. The last two episodes are brilliant and I'd say it's one of the most satisfying endings\n          \n        to any anime series I've watched.\nThe tight, overarching plot is one that is well-crafted and well-paced, and where every moment is meaningful. You feel like you know the characters after all--to differing degrees, of course. There are exciting, badass moments to enjoy, the music is good, and the violence is extreme. That last one is not really a plus in my book, but is a point to take note of.\nCan you tell I really like this show? Well, I don't want to raise your expectations too high. Best to take it slow. Start from the beginning.\n        "},

		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="                          \n    Baccano is one of those anime I've heard mentioned several times but have never seen. The anime was adapted from a series of light novels written by Narita Ryohgo. The anime was handled by Brain's Base, a studio that I have never watched anything from. So, this is going to serve as my introduction to them. Maybe I'll even let them have a goodnight kiss if they make a good first impression, but they'd better not expect more than that. What kind of guy do they think I am? With that said, and some strange people taking it seriously, let's take a look at Baccano.\nThere\n          \n        are actually three rather distinct stories in Baccano. Tied together through both repeated characters and elements. There's a story about trouble aboard a train, a story about a young girl looking for her brother, and a story about a group of people gaining immortality. The stories are told non-linearly with just about every episode having elements of all of them. This does present one issue. The very first episode shows the ending of the second story chronologically. Just think about that for a moment. You know exactly who's going to survive. The end result is that a lot of moments that should be dramatic aren't. Now, to be fair, showing the three stories simultaneously does essentially eliminate any tension that the earlier stories could have had. Now, you may be wondering why the ending of the second story spoils so much. The basic answer is that the final chronological story, Eve's search for her brother, doesn't involve most of the characters from the other two stories. The characters who were on the train don't even make an appearance. In short, they could have kept all three going simultaneously and still gained some good drama from the second story, if they hadn't started by showing the aftermath. Another issue is that the anime jumps between incredibly goofy moments to serious moments frequently, sometimes in the span of seconds. Again, let's be fair. There are some anime that balance drama and comedy quite successfully, but that's not the way to do it. In order to maintain a good balance you need time to transition between the serious and the comedic. Moments where the comedy/drama winds down to make room for the other. If you switch between them quickly it doesn't work. It's just disjointing. Another thing that bothers me is that there's a scene in the very first episode with two reporters talking about strange events and trying to make sense of... well, the rest of the series. The problem is that after the first episode these characters are never seen nor referenced again. Which renders the whole scene entirely pointless. Maybe they show up in the specials, but that doesn't give them any relevance to the main series. They could've been cut out completely and nothing would have been lost. To Baccano's credit though, the humour does work pretty well and the stories are unique and it's interesting to see how they unfold. \nBaccano has an unwieldy cast and they try to give a lot of them their own story arcs. The basic result is that the arcs are really short, rushed and most of them are pretty pointless. Some of the characters are interesting but most are pretty one-dimensional. Which works for the goofier characters like Isaac and Miria, but not so much for the more serious characters like Firo and Chane. For every interesting character there are three or four with very little personality. Most of them only serve one or two basic purposes in the story and are never developed beyond a few traits. \nThe art is actually one of Baccano's stronger points. The characters have unique looks, there are some strong action sequences and there are some good details. Now, there are some problems. Some of the action sequences are kind of confusing. They get rushed through too quickly and it can be difficult to tell jut what happened with some of them. There are also some really bizarre facial expressions, particularly from Jacuzzi. To be fair, they're probably meant to be more humorous than anything else, but they don't really work most of the time. \nThe voice acting is another generally well done aspect. Every actor gives a performance that's completely suited to their character. Koyasu Takehito gives a very calm and collected performance as the calm and collected Luck. Sakaguchi Daisuke gives a generally whiny performance as the generally whiny Jacuzzi. Aoki Sayaka and Onosaka Masaya both give loud and exaggerated performances as Miria and Isaac and so on. I will acknowledge that it can get more than a little tiring, though. Yeah, it's perfectly suited to the characters but that just means that the lack of character complexity carries over to the voice acting. There may be a lot of great actors in this, but they don't get to demonstrate their range. Except for, possibly, Kanda Akemi who plays one of the more emotionally complex characters. The music is pretty simple. There's a high energy track for the high energy scenes. A more toned down track for the more dramatic scenes and so on. \nThe yuri factor is a 1/10. Honestly, there's not a lot of interaction among the female characters. Yeah, Miria gets to be on friendly terms with both Ennis and Nice but there's nothing beyond that and those scenes are pretty short.\nSo, that's Baccano. It's... okay. There are some funny scenes, the art is well done and there's some good action, but the story is lacking and the characters are largely dull and under-developed. If you just want some hyper-active fun you'll probably like it. If you want some kind of depth, you'd be better served with something else. Final rating: 6/10. No goodnight kiss for Brain's Base, but they can have a handshake. \n        "},

Stuff that has no purpose for existing, has  no substance and only serves to waste your time. \nAnyone with a BASIC understanding of good storytelling can tell why this is bad. But while the animation and music for it is perfectly fine, nothing else works. From the start of the show you're just left confused and annoyed. Confused about the story, what's actually going on and about why the hell the story's timeline is all jumbled up(there IS no reason). Annoyed at the\n          \n        character's stupidity that has no charm to it, at it's inability to tell a coherent story and plot and at the voice acting. I made the mistake of watching this dubbed under pretense that it was the correct way to watch it because of the setting. But since I hate the old timey-New York/American accent, the dub simply added to the torture. Looking back on it now, I probably should've switched to the sub. Oops.\nBiggest reasons for this anime not working at all is this:There is no reason to care about these characters or about what happens to them because the vast majority of them are all immortal. How am I supposed to care about these people and what's happening to them if nothing bad can happen to them and there's no consequences? They can't die. The immortal characters are LITERALLY indestructible. Save for the plot point of this old dude (they're all old but whatever) who starts \"Devouring\" immortals. Which is just a lazy way of trying to remedy the lack of tension coming from the plot point of immortality that YOU (the writer) CREATED! This problem is not hard to understand at all, this is called using your brain.\nI didn't care about any of the characters or the events of the story. Literally nothing interested me. It. was. BORING! \nThe one thing I like though was one character who was mute, and I enjoyed watching how she interacted with other people. It's something that belongs in a much better anime. \nAnother thing that bothered me is it's unbelievably poor control of tone. There so many unpleasant scenes in this that even I had trouble watching them. There's a scene where one character beats up another dude repeatedly while spouting asinine lines. And it JUST. KEEPS. GOING. The whole time I was saying \" I get it, he's insane, I get it, I get it.\" And it's not a \"good\" insane either like the Joker. It's just unpleasant. Unpleasant scenes with unpleasant violence. I don't get it, is this anime supposed to be fun? \nFinally is the ending, or lack thereof. The fact that this has the balls to talk down to me and have an ending discussion on what makes good stories is insulting. Especially when the writer CAN'T MAKE ONE HIMSELF. It's pretentious, pseudo and it's crap, and all the rating out there for this anime are full of it too.            \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    To sum this up, a brilliant work of an anime. Baccano is the first anime that I have rewatched for good reason. In this story, or stories, the first episode makes absolutely no sense at all. I would personally say that did no enjoy the beginning of it, and it wasn't until episode 3 or 4 that I was invested in this anime. The beginning implies a lot of what happens through the series, but the lack of an established plot and the cut scenes makes it incredibly hard to understand. However, as the anime moved towards the plot further into the story, I was\n          \n        amazed at how well planned and thought out this was, and even more astounded when I rewatched it, noticing all the implications that I missed. Once I rewatched it, the whole series made very much sense to me, especially the first episode.\nThis anime is mainly about 3 or 4 different timelines which intertwine into one big story about the elixir of immortality. These different points in time and location, whether aboard the train, the flying pussyfoot, in the middle of the ocean, or in an underground basement with elders searching for the elixir or the story of a girl trying to find her brother, all intertwine and give an amazingly detailed story. Because of the span of this, the anime does not have a linear storytelling style. It is similar to a puzzle, where watching it is like solving a puzzle from the outside, and seeing more and more of the picture, but because of this, there is no real climax to the anime. Nothing builds up to an overall climax, but Baccano makes a good decision to end each episode on a cliffhanger, which is addictive to continue and the climaxes along the way are very enjoyable to watch.\nWith the sound, because I personally believe that this anime has one of the greatest soundtracks of all anime. The upbeat jazz in the background uses the same theme in different variations, letting this anime have over one hour of different soundtrack pieces played int the background. The opening of the anime,  imho, is awesome, better than the one of Attack on Titan. It displays a lot of the anime and also makes implications on the story, but it was a shame that there were too many charaters to be introduced. I advise not skipping the introduction because the anime has more characters than episodes, and the opening does do a great job at introducing the major ones.\nThe characters, where some people would say are underdeveloped due to the lack of screen time for each individual character, was done very well. The anime is sort of crime based, leading to interesting characters in interesting settings between mafia and robberies and killing. Between the psychotic killers, the \"innocent\" kids, the worse robbers ever and the situations that arise from immortality, Baccano provides great drama between these interactions.\nIt is not in my favor to judge the anime on how good the art is, and art is not required to make an anime good. Based on the storyline, characters, and soundtrack, I conclude that i enjoyed this anime and would recommend it to anyone and everyone. However, it is unlike many other anime in every aspect, other than the fact that it is made in Japan. 10/10 I also recommend to watch the first episode of the series after you've finished it to understand what is happening.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    In anime, it's become extremely irritating to deal with character cliches nowadays. You have your self-insert harem protagonist with otaku habits that may have the urge to bone his sister, the cynical edgy protagonist who sits at the back of the classroom next to a window, and the hot headed shounen protagonist who is oblivious to all the girls that want his dick. While not all anime have cookie cutter characters like this, the market is saturated with characters that are made with the sole intention of being relatable to the loser demographic and wish fulfillment \nBaccano! is none of this. The show focuses greatly\n          \n        on character interactions and development more than any other anime I've seen. Bear in mind: The amount of unique and developed characters number in the twenties when certain anime fail to produce one likable character.\nThe show starts with an interesting take on exposition. \"Baccano!\" is the quiet kid in elementary school because it has a lot to show, and not a lot to tell. Never have I felt that the show was shoving certain things about its world into my face and the world was presented smoothly (if not slow at first). The story isn't clear at first, but that's part of the appeal as the first 5 episodes are you trying to figure out exactly what's going on. Even as you're figuring everything out, you're rewarded with great characters who interact with each other well. \nThe characters are the main focus of the show. Narita is famous for saying that his characters write the story for him, and you can see it with \"Baccano!\".  Characters range from suave playboys, likable hitmen, an oblivious bonnie and clyde duo, and psychotic train conductors, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. And these characters don't need people to tell about how cool/crazy/badass they are, as they can show you through their dialogue and interactions. \nThe music in the anime isn't exactly something to talk about standalone, but it's always fitting. The score compliments the setting well and sets the mood and atmosphere fantastically. It's hard to think about a better musical selection for this anime. While anime have legendary soundtracks that \"Baccano!\" may lack, it's impossible to say that a soundtrack fit \"Baccano!\" better than the one it has now.\nWhile this isn't the greatest plot in the world, it's well nuanced enough to be a talking point among the other elements this show has. The plot's strength isn't within itself, but how malleable it is to the characters. Each character plays an integral part to the story and no character really affects it more than another. As a result, you have an interesting story that reflects itself off how the characters interact within it. \nAll in all, this may be one of my favorite if not my favorite anime. If you're into dialogue and character development then this anime is for you. If you're into generic characters and lazy exposition.... well I guess there's a bunch of other LN adaptations for you to watch.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    The beginning of Baccano! is a disorienting experience. Forget linear storytelling-the series actually spends half an episode debating just how to tell its story through a sequence of meta dialogue between a newspaper vice-president and his secretary. What it settles on is scrambling a tale that already has a huge scope in terms of ground covered and characters included by jumping around between several seemingly unrelated storylines, and doesn't settle down until several episodes after that. And even then, even then, I still wouldn't blame you if you felt lost. Some people have said that it's disrespectful of the audience to do this-it's like throwing\n          \n        them out in the ocean without a life vest. But that's an odd criticism, since it implies that it's respectful to simply tell a story like anybody else would, using the same techniques we learned in 6th grade English class. Isn't that just milquetoast? And it's especially odd when you level that criticism in anime, where anything resembling \"normal\" is routinely routed, twisted and bungled for the sake of being as cool as possible.\nLike The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Baccano! deliberately abandons those conventional methods with reckless abandon. And unlike Haruhi, there's a meta-textual method to its madness; a commentary on how stories never really have a proper beginning or ending, that what we watch and read is only a snapshot of something much bigger and that continues long after the final reel goes black. And when you're telling a story as big as this one, are there even main characters, or just one person of many who the narrator arbitrarily picks? It's an appropriate theme for a story about immortality, and especially this one.\nMost media portray immortality the same way: a route \"be careful what you wish for\" fable. Surprisingly, Baccano! eschews that idea and embraces immortality, because life is an excellent, excellent thing. As long as you have friends and family to live it with, who are you kidding? Why wouldn't you want to live forever?\nEspecially when it's friends like the cast of characters populating this anime-a suite of eighteen that includes Jokers, Thieves, Murderers, Gangsters, Lovers, Monsters, and even a couple of Idiots make up the \"main cast.\" There's Miria and Isaac, a lovable duo of happy-go-lucky thieves who have only gotten away with so many crimes because they pull them off in profoundly stupid ways. There's Dallas, a young punk who is a much worse thief, if only because he accidentally stole the wrong thing at the wrong time. There's Szilard, a sinister immortal who has been scamming people for over a century with a fake immortality elixir. He has just recently recreated the real deal, though, and is enraged that some punk has stolen it. His silent assistant, the emotionless homunculus Ennis, is supposed to retrieve it. And she meant to, but she met this sweet boy named Firo, who is the ingenious new inductee to the Camorra mafia family. Ladd Russo is a psychotic son-of-a-gun who has boarded the Flying Pussyfoot with his gang of white suit assassins to kidnap a Senator's family. He didn't count on the black suited orchestra actually being a rival group of assassins, or on the Rail Tracer, a monster that hunts down trains and devours its passengers. And then there's the Gandor and Martillo family, Dallas' sister Eve, the cult leader Huey Leforet, his mute daughter Chane, the capable crybaby Jacuzzi and the sadistic kid Czeslaw. In a hobby filled with colorful and memorable characters, Baccano!'s cast leave a helluva an impression, and when it seems like the story is beyond your grasp, latching onto the strong cast makes the road to understanding less bumpy.\nEven when you sit down and string the events of this series into a linear path it's still a crazy tale. Much like a Rube Goldberg contraption, seemingly unrelated subplots bump into other subplots, which coincidently stumble onto other events before characters meet other characters in strange circumstances, creating a surprise twist. I should note here that \"baccano\" is Italian for \"ruckus,\" and it's an apt description of this series.\nIn Highlander: The Search for Vengence, having immortal characters who healed from nearly any wound gave its director Kawajiri a license to show outlandish violence. Baccano! doesn't so much take that idea a step further as give it a running start. Heads will roll, and if there wasn't anything you would recognize as a head left, it will still piece itself back together...on camera. Like Kurozuka, it's a stylishly violent series with so much blood being spilt it almost repaints the dining car in the Flying Pussyfoot red. I haven't seen anything like it since Hellsing Ultimate- it's so outlandish it could only have been visualized through animation. It's not for the squeamish, but for people like myself who enjoy stylized violence like this, it's a treat. It helps that the animation looks great throughout, especially for a TV series- the initial episodes looked so good I was afraid that the finale's budget would only allow for a series of still frames.\nYou'd expect a series mostly set in the Great Depression with so much violence and danger to be...depressing, but in the end, it's a joy to watch. It's a suspenseful series with such a large cast that it feels like no one is armed with plot armor-no one, even the \"immortals,\" are guaranteed to come out of this insanity alive. There is a palpable feeling of danger. And when it wraps up, even with a few threads left dangling, some justice has been served, and even better, some characters find love. While the series ends on an epilogue that feels a bit flat, it left me with the best possible feeling: a mixture of contentment and a hunger to see more. \n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n                          \n     In depth review #3 - Baccano!\nYou know that one show you were planning on watching for years now but never got to it yet. The same show that you heard amazing things about, and saw showing up on everyone’s “Best Animes Ever” lists? Well for me, Baccano! was that show. I knew I was missing out on something great, but I never had the drive to actually sit down and watch it. Maybe it was because the setting was based in the 1930’s or that I didn’t know much about it. Either way I started this anime yesterday from hearing about it 5 years\n          \n        ago, and after finishing it I feel like an idiot. I can’t believe I missed out on such an ambitious unique anime for so long. To put it simply Baccano! was amazing. It isn’t my favorite anime but by critiquing the story, animation, music, characters and my personal enjoyment of the show, I just can’t give it anything less than a brilliant score. \nStory 9: (Outstanding)\nBefore I explain what this show is about, I just need to point out that Baccano has the best story development and writing I have ever seen in anime. This is due from how the writer perfected the art of storytelling through multiple perspectives. A writing style that displays a centralized event and shows us the point of views of everybody involved with it. This type of writing style in used in shows such as Lost or Heros. Moving on, the overarching story of Baccano revolves around the events that occurred on a transcontinental train called the flying pussyfoot in 1931. The events that transpired on this train is shown through the eyes of different significant people on this train. The story also gives us frequent time skips into the future and into the past. This is done to get a clear understanding of everyone’s motives for getting onto the train, everyone’s agendas while on the train, and everyone’s back stories. It is worth mentioning that the beginning will leave you with a lot of questions but i assure you all of your questions will be answer by episode 4.\nAnimation 7: (Good)\nThe animation was good considering how old this show is. However, compared to other anime such as Fate/Stay Night unlimited blade works, the animation isn't really anything special. Don’t worry though, I never had a single problem with the animation while watching this show. Even the darker scenes were nicely lit and visible. In addition, the animation of the setting was surprisingly realistic. I went to New York, and Chicago a couple of times in the past and some of the scenes included landmarks that i recognized. It actually looked like an older version of the real places. Even the characters looked like actual people. For Baccano being the show it is, the animation fit well.\nSound 10: (Outstanding)\nThere are only a couple of shows that I would give the sound in a 10/10. I only do this for shows that have literally the best OST in all of anime, or OST that makes me like an unfavorable genre. The last show that did this was Samurai Champloo. That OST was absolute perfection even though I hate rap music. Baccano did the exact same thing with jazz. Besides the jazz music in Fallout 3 I don’t usually listen to the genre but man, this OST had me replaying each song a thousand times. No one can tell me with a straight face that Baccano’s soundtrack isn’t good because they would be lying. Something that is also unorthodox is that I enjoyed several tracks more than the opening theme. Usually I like the opening theme song the most but a lot of effort and time went in to each song. Baccano deserves a perfect score for this feat alone. \nAs for the voice acting, I was in awe while these people talked. I can’t say anything about the Japanese cast but the English cast was ridiculously talented. The accents sounded genuine for a story based in the 1930's. It went to a whole another level when a character changed their accent to a french one in certain flashbacks in 1711. It was probably different voice actors but it did add to the realism dramatically. Also the voice actors for Ladd Russo, Jacuzzi and Isaac where the best I heard in a long time. Everyone else was also amazing but these three went over the threshold. Even the voice actor for the furor from Fullmetal alchemist brotherhood was in the cast. Probably the best dub i have ever heard. \nCharacters 10: (Outstanding)\nIf I had to pick one thing that I liked the most about this anime, it would be the characters. The characters in my opinion is what made Baccano, Baccano! It was very ambitious to have so many characters in the cast but I enjoyed everyone’s time on the screen. There were 2 to 3 characters I really didn’t care for like the little girl looking for her brother but this didn’t matter since I really liked the 12 other main characters in this anime. I can talk about each character for days but this section would be 18 paragraphs long. The ones that are worth mentioning though is Issac and Miria. This couple had to be the best interpretation of comedic relief I have ever seen. Their clueless attitudes and hijinks brought a new light to this anime and made me grin and laugh whenever they came onto the screen. Even the characters in the show loved them. They did what Mako from kill la kill couldn’t, becoming an appropriate tool of comic relief, and is why they are one of my favorite characters of all time. Also Ladd Russo and Vino have to be some of the coolest characters in anime. The personalities, and philosophies are expressed through their crazy actions which made me like them both a lot. After you watch this anime, I guarantee that a least one character from this cast will become one of your favorite characters of all time. \nEnjoyment 9: (Great)\nBaccano! was a roller coaster ride in the form of an anime; one that I honestly never wanted it to end. I would of had loved to see this anime continue but that would have been selfish. This show ended the series perfectly. Even though I had a couple a questions I needed answered after it ended, everything was covered in the show at some point. I even willingly watch the entire thing again because it was just that good. Seeing the story start the way it did after watching the whole thing was actually kind of fun. This was the case probably because the beginning was a bit crazy. The creator just kind of throws its viewers in the middle of a storm, and makes us wait it out to understand what is going on. After episode 4 however most of your question will be answered. Besides this small instance, I enjoyed Baccano! a lot more than I initially thought I would. The story, the characters, and the OST was absolute perfection and if you have working eyes, you HAVE TO WATCH Baccano! \n9.0/10 (Great) - Must Watch Now"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    It will frequently be said that Baccano! (emphasis on the second 'a', I believe, if you care about that kind of thing) is a hardcore anime, containing rather heady themes, vulgar language, and some of the most deliciously graphic violence to grace our shores. In this light, the series on the whole should be considered as a reward to all those who are or aspire to be \"hardcore \". Simply put, I have not enjoyed an anime as much as I've enjoyed Baccano! for some time.\n\"The more things change, the more they stay the same.\" Likewise, as much as Baccano! is a ferociously original show,\n          \n        it still succeeds in all the conventional ways: the story is simple yet engaging, the characters are larger than life yet completely relatable, and the technical aspects have all been polished to a mirror shine. \nNot to say that there isn't anything wrong with Baccano! (and considering how much I have to say in favor for it, it would probably be much easier to start with my critiques anyway). Now, as should be obvious from anyone who has seen a clip or screen shot of the series, Baccano! is very well drawn with a wide range of character designs and some lovingly created locations. However, there is often a trade-off to be made in exchange for this degree of artwork, and that's where animation comes into play. The action scenes are highly fluid and beautifully choreographed, but the fact remains that the majority of the show requires characters to talk and interact in comparatively subtle ways. And whenever you find yourself watching an extended conversation scene, especially after multiple viewings, it becomes almost distractingly obvious just how little these characters move. Characters express themselves to an audience of cardboard cutouts, all listening with rapt, unblinking attention. Talking heads move smoothly past painted backdrops. Worst of all are those moments when a character enters a room or finishes a sentence, then freezes just a second too long, their mouths hanging open as testament to some animator cutting corners. To be fair, these problems seem to affect some episodes more than others, but when they're there and when you're looking for them, they can really take you out of the experience.\nAt least, they do the second and third time around. Speaking as someone whose watched the entire 13 episode arc three or four times now, I can say that those willing to persevere through the aforementioned stiffness will be rewarded with an immensely entertaining and rewatchable show. As if the 10s across the board didn't tip you off, this show has got it all, from a thoroughly engaging story fleshed out with tons of great characters (Bryan Massey's take on Ladd is absolutely fearless, and Issac and Miria are 24 carat comedy gold) to one of the best anime soundtracks around. Though before I get away from the characters, I will say this: only two black characters in the whole show, and you make them a kidnapped maid and a secretary who talks like a cross between Chris Tucker and Double D from Ed, Edd 'n Eddy?\n\"No matter.\"\nPS: Before I go, there's one more thing I want to touch on. Personally, I believe that Baccano! will go down in anime history as having one of the best ever American dubs. What bothers me is that it seems as though there's a fairly decent portion of the population out there who will let such trivial things as New York accents (or rather,\" Noo Yok\" accents) ruin the whole experience for them. Personally, I've never been that distracted by accents of any kind, save the ridiculously racial ones (and Baccano! might have its fair share of those too, now that I mention it), and what's more, I've never understood how something as harmless as a cartoonish Brooklyn drawl  could be considered offensive, let alone a deal breaker. In short, I feel that I must say that if you are the kind of person who wants, nay, demands their cartoon 1930s mobsters talk like \"real\" people, then perhaps you simply lack the capacity for suspended disbelief that is necessary to enjoy any kind of cartoon, let alone one of the greatest in recent memory.\n        "},

I'm not sure if I even want to watch episode 2 if it continues on like this.\nMarch 30th, 2009: \nI gotta admit, I wasn't a huge fan at first. The first episode and even the 2nd are tough to understand. Lots of stuff is happening, and it flashes so quick, you don't even have too good of a chance to learn the characters.

While there are several stories, the main one involves a train that 3 different factions of immortals have boarded with different goals. Now, the immortals are fighting, and it's badass as hell. All the action scenes are pretty short in Baccano!, but they are masterfully done and exhilarating. I think I quite like this show.\nMarch 30th, 2009: \nThere are only a few flaws with Baccano!

Also, there is a bit of a slow stretch in the middle of the show, as you wait for the big stuff to happen in the last few episodes, but other than that, the show is nearly flawless. I imagine this is a show I will rewatch one day, which is something I don't generally say about anime. On a 2nd watch, this show probably gets even better, as you would be able to understand every little thing going on.\nI would easily recommend Baccano! to anyone. It's short, only 13 episodes, the characters are great, there is action, romance, tension, it's a show I think that anyone can easily enjoy.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Summary:  Baccano is an anime that could have been one of the best ever.  Unfortunately, due to a series of missteps, the series is merely great, not perfect.  Even so, it's a show well worth watching, and one that takes a lot of new and interesting steps.\nReview:\nBaccano is an anime with a lot of problems.  During the first half of the show, it steadfastly refuses to give away any information, while simultaneously adding extra confusion by jumping all around the continuity.  These jumps could be okay, but they're usually entirely without context.  There is no connection between the scene\n          \n        in 1932 and the following scene in 1930.  The only thing connecting them is the greater plot.\nCombine this with the fact that there are about 12 main characters (fortunately, MOST of them are shown over and over again in the opening credits), and you get a great recipe for audience confusion.  It certainly doesn't help any that at the same time you're trying to juggle these characters, you're also trying to remember which Mob they belong to, etc.\nUnfortunately, that's not all.  The show is also jam packed with absurdity.  The comic relief is constantly getting in the way, and by a few minutes into the second episode you wish that they would just shut up for a moment.  As well, the premise is muddled by the introduction of other supernatural-seeming characters in the middle of the series, after we feel like we have a grip on the way the universe works.  Also, and this may not be a deterrent for everyone, but the show is packed with the most absurd shouneny-seinen content around.\nFinally, there's the fact that the director forgot to do his research.  Many times, when a reference to American culture would have been appropriate, a reference to Japanese culture is substituted instead.  It makes the whole setting seem a bit fragile, knowing that someone didn't care enough to push the show that extra distance.\nNormally, with all these problems, I would have given up on this show almost right away.  Either that, or I would have watched the show and hated it for not living up to its potential.  It's a testament to the power of Baccano that neither of these happened.  The fact is that despite all its problems, Baccano came through when it counted.\nFirst of all, the sheer style exuded by the settings helped bring the feeling that we really were in 1930s America.  Once I got past the initial confusion, the flashbacks and flashforwards were actually kind of nice.  They gave me the feeling that I was in on some secret that the cast of the show were missing.  The characters all came out amazing by the end of the show.  I don't think there's a single character in the show that I would be able to call a hero, or that I can really even say that I completely like, but it didn't end up bothering me because they were all so interesting.  Admittedly, most of them were cliches, but they were cliches taken to such an absurd degree that they somehow weren't cliches anymore.\nI was really worried about the story as I got closer to the end.  It didn't seem to have the depth that the complexity of the presentation required.  Honestly, the story was a little bit shallow, but the narrative came together so well that it didn't matter.  Even though it lacked serious depth, it was explored to its full potential, and had a feeling of completeness that I wasn't expecting.\nAnd, as I seem to have come to the subject of the ending, I would like to note that it was very well done.  It erased many of the doubts I had about the series earlier on, and despite all the shouneny-seinen stuff, kept me watching straight through the ending to the OVA.  I won't say much more for spoilers, but the split narrative definitely pays off in the end.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    BACCANO: Jumbled storytelling -- for the better\nFor some, Baccano may be a little hard to follow, because of the mere fact that the storytelling is not linear, and the events presented are not in chronological order. But the good news is, the anime has its ways on helping its viewers have an easier time subscribing to the stories.\nThe opening theme is the prime example of this. It gives the viewers an idea on which characters are important. Another example is how the anime shows the year a particular sequence has happened, so the viewers could stitch the sequences that have happened in a particular year\n          \n        in their minds. Also, the anime has the decency to repeat certain sequences, so as not to confuse the viewers on the chronological placement of the particular sequence in a particular story.\nPersonally, Baccano is actually not hard to follow. Really, it doesn’t take much effort to pay extra attention to get the rhythm of the storytelling. In fact, when you get the vibe of it, you won’t be even needing the year when a particular sequence happened, or even the repetition of sequences to get the chronological order. They just stitch themselves in your mind automatically if you pay attention enough.\nWhat I really like about the stories in Baccano is how they are interconnected really smoothly, even though they happen on different time periods and places. The plot points that connect them make sense, and they are actually quite surprising when they are revealed -- quite comedic in some instances too.\nSpeaking of comedy, Baccano is probably one of the anime titles with the most fun pool of characters. Isaac and Miria are just extremely good in lightening the mood every time they are on screen. Ladd Russo is unusually charismatic for a brute -- same goes with the Rail Tracer. To balance out the light characterization, we also have Jacuzzi Splot, Czeslaw Meyer, and many others. We also have the laid-back ones like Firo Prochainezo. The characters are very interesting in their own right. They also blend well together.\nWhat I find most impressive in the characterization is that there still has been room for character development. Considering that the number of characters is too high for such a short anime, that is something worth noting.\nAnother thing worth noting is the music. Baccano has one of the most exhilarating soundtracks I’ve heard in all of anime. They are also very thematic, which suits the overall design of the anime. These soundtracks are embedded perfectly, particularly in the action scenes.\nOverall, Baccano is a very impressive title. Its unique storytelling style, even though it is confusing in theory, is actually not confusing.  This storytelling is accompanied by interesting characters and music that is way beyond ordinary. This is easily a must-watch."},

Is perfection being as good as possible, or does perfection simply mean without flaws. You may wonder if there is a difference, and I would say yes. I believe that being perfect means being the best in every conceivable manner. But that also means that I believe something could be flawless without being perfect. Nothing in this world is perfect, and that extends to anime as well. But ladies and gentlemen, Baccano! is the one series that I can describe as flawless. Throughout these 13 episodes there was not a single instance in the writing where I thought\n          \n        \"there's a mistake\". There weren't any plot holes, this anime didn't rely on blatantly obvious plot devices to move the story along, it was simply the story. \nNow whether or not one considers this anime to be magnificent or not should fall squarely on the shoulders of their own personal enjoyment. Maybe you will dislike the style of the story, but that doesn't mean it is flawed, just not your personal taste. Everything in this world is subjective, but cast aside your personal enjoyment and you can still recognize something as great. \nBaccano! is an anime that stands on top of a building and shouts to the world its unique sense of style. For that is one word that may sum up this show perfectly, it has style. \nStory: 9\nBaccano is Italian for ruckus, and this story certainly feels like a ruckus. Three plot-lines, three years, all interspersed and interchanged over the course of 13 episodes. Aside from the very early scenes each individual story-line follows a sequential order of events, but the three stories are all mixed together with nothing to show the distinction between them. One scene is set in 1930, the next in 1931, but you aren't told that. \nLet me make one thing clear, you will undoubtedly be confused while watching. Over time however, the mysteries and questions will develop answers, and the final episode manages to tie off all three story-lines in a neat little bow. \nThe three story lines are set in 1930, 1931, and 1932 respectively. In 1930 the story is centered around an elixir of immortality. In 1931 the story is centered around the transcontinental train, The Flying Pussyfoot, as it travels to New York. In 1932 the story centers around the search for Dallas Genohard. \nEach story is separate, yet connected. The first episode gives you major spoilers for each of the stories, but you have no bloody clue how or why they're spoilers. The way this story is presented is extraordinarily unique. I fervently hope that no one ever attempts to recreate this style, as I doubt it could ever compare to the beauty that is Baccano! The method of story-telling may be off putting to some, but I'll be damned if the few episodes of confusion aren't worth it all in the end. Any confusion you may have never detracts from the viewing experience. The creators intended us to have no damn clue what was going on. It even creates some re-watch value as you can go back and re-watch the show having full knowledge of events and characters. You can point to a moment, laugh, and say \"Ohhhhhhh, so that's what that was.\"\nArt: 9\nVery, very good animation. Every scene shows fluidity, which is especially noticeable in the actions scenes. Maybe I just have bad eyes, but the manner in which the overall color palette was dulled a bit just added to the 1930's setting for this anime. \nLoved the character designs. You will have no trouble distinguishing between characters as they are all so individualistic. You won't know their names, but you will certainly know how they look. \nThe opening is fantastic. You will most likely end up watching it for the majority of the series as it is sort of necessary to do so. The opening shows nearly every single character as well as their names. You will want to watch it just to apply names to the characters. \nI'll be honest, I scarcely remember the ending. I am pretty sure I watched it only a single time. I do not believe it was bad, but I just had to click onto the next episode. \nSound: 10\nThe OST is simply put, awesome. I can't say you will go and buy the entire soundtrack, but with heavy jazz styled songs, the OST added to each scene exponentially. \nThe song to accompany the awesome visuals of the opening is a single by Paradise Lunch entitled \"Gun's & Roses\". It's awesome. A cool jazz song that just seeps to your pores and demands movement from your body. I don't burst into dance every time I hear it, but be it foot, hand, or head, something will move. \nThe truly magnificent aspect of Baccano's sound however, is its voice acting. The English dub is one of, if not the best dub ever made. Every voice was absolutely perfect for the character, and the VAs delivered their lines brilliantly. Many of the characters boasted accents befitting 1930's New York, and it was amazing. I know I am using words of praise frequently, but honestly, Baccano! deserves it. \nCharacter: 10\n\"Depending on who you place in the same situation, the characteristics of said incident change kaleidoscopically. In other words, there is one incident. However, there are as many stories explaining it as there are people involved in it.\"\nBaccano's greatest feature is most definitely its characters, and it has a bloody lot of them. Three story-lines, and many of the characters are unique to a single one. There are plenty of cross-overs as well, but many of the characters remained fairly isolated to their story. There isn't a main character either, none of the story-lines can be said to have a main. Each story-line has its standout characters, sure. But the story doesn't follow them. Only two characters make appearances in all of the stories, but even they cannot be described as the main characters. \nSome of the standout characters are as follows: \nIsaac and Miria- They are a pair, and don't you dare try to separate them. One cannot be mentioned without the other. They are easily one of the best couples in anime, and it should be almost impossible not to love them. They're lovable, eccentric, and completely oblivious. Every moment they're on screen is golden. They are the only ones to appear in each of the plot-lines, and that is a highly amusing fact. \nLadd Russo- Think about a 7 year old boy running around in a candy store, but take away all forms of supervision. Oh, he would just go crazy. Running around eating this and eating that. He would love the candy, he would probably get messy, pure ecstasy for that 7 year old. Now age said child 18 years, and replace his love for candy with a love for guns and death. The mess is no longer sticky, sweet candy. It is instead blood. \nLadd is your sadistic hitman with a love for guns. I'll let you figure out the rest of his character for yourself, but if nothing else, count on the fact that he will leave an impression. \nClaire Stanfield- I don't really know how to describe Claire without giving some spoilers... Ok, think of him as the best assassin in the world. That's about all I can say. He will steal every moment he is on screen through sheer style and bad-assery. \nThey're the standout characters, the most memorable, but the others are all amazing too. From Firo (one of my personal favorites) to Chane, Nice to Luck, Eve to Lua, Maiza to Rachel. All of them will leave a mark, and all of them add to the story.\nWith such a large cast you may be wondering if the characters can undergo any real development in the course of only 13 episodes. The answer to that is both yes and no. Some characters will be the same from start to finish, others will be different. Is that a flaw? I would say no. How often have you completely changed your personality in the course of a day? In that sense their development is realistic. We are molded by the course of events in our life, so for some who the plot is a great event, they change. Others do not. \nThe characters are the true focus of the plot, which is very obvious when you consider the way it was written. The original author never wrote detailed plot outlines, but allowed the characters and their actions to move the story along. Some character move faster than others, but all inevitably reach the same end. \nEnjoyment: 10\nLoved, loved, loved, loved this anime. It is easily one of my favorites. No doubt you have been able to pick up on that fact. But do not disregard my words as personal bias alone. I would say the fact still remains that though an individual may not like certain aspects of this anime, they cannot call it flawed. I loved the action, I was enthralled by the dialogue, and some of the humor had me laughing my ass off. \nOverall: 10\nThis anime is truly worthy of the word \"Masterpiece\". It has an awesome story, amazing art, a good OST and a brilliant dub. Extraordinary characters and is thoroughly enjoyable throughout the entire 13 episodes. This show has such a unique style it provides one of the best first time viewing experiences. I have shows that I like more, but I can't say any of them provided an experience even remotely similar to Baccano's. \nI feel that this show truly has something for everyone. At the very least, it is only 13 episodes. But, if you start it, you have to finish it. Finishing Baccano! is the only way you can form an honest opinion of it. \nBaccano! truly is a flawless anime worthy of all its praise."},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    So anime is Japanese. Duh. Everyone knows that. Obviously there are some exceptions, but for the most part anime is most closely related to Japan. Because of this fact, there are many situations in anime where a show will be set in modern-day Tokyo or historical Japan. What you don't often see, however, is an anime set in 1930's New York. Which is quite a shame considering how well a setting like this opens itself up for interesting concepts as Baccano! shows. \nFrom the masterminds behind amazing shows like Durarara!! and D-Frag! (geez, this company is obsessed with putting \"!\" in the titles of their\n          \n        shows), Baccano! is another amazing piece of animations and a truly unique and interesting story. The show definitely feels a lot like Durarara!! and in a way could almost be seen as existing within the same world (characters form Baccano! appear in some scenes of Durarara!!, the code for the Dollars website in Durarara!! is 'Baccano', etc.). Durarara!!, having come out many years after Baccano!, definitely takes many things from the show such as a huge cast of characters that are laid out for the viewer in the opening to help them remember all the names, the supernatural element of the show, and the use of many converging storylines just to name some examples.\nWhere does Baccano! excel? Well, an easier question would be where does it NOT. Starting with the characters, Baccano! has one of the most diverse and colorful cast of characters of any anime I've seen, from a man who gets his kicks from murdering people, the 'unique' couple of Issac and Miria, and the cowardly gang leader and his, uh, 'explosive' girlfirend. No character is left to just be ignored and all have a significant role in each of their own arcs. It's also very enjoyable watching different characters from different arcs coming together and interacting and seeing what happens from that point on. \nSidenote: If you wish to watch this show, I recommend the dub. I typically lean more towards sub, but the 1930's New York accents can't be matched in the sub.\nAlong with the stellar cast, Baccano! has many interesting storylines that will keep you guessing until everything is resolved. The show also sports a very good mix of modern music to accentuate that this is a very complex story, but it also has very many tracks that are more classical and jazzy to fit the vibe of the time period the show lays out. Animation is solid for its time and nothing really seemed to be off about the art. Speaking of, I loved how the show used a very good mix of dark colors for the time of mystery and action, but also had very many moments of bright color to highlight the comedy or emotional aspects.\nBaccano! is essentially pre-Durarara!! and shows that Brain's Base is a very competent group that knows how to produce anime and especially characters within anime. The show may be a somewhat slow to start, but once you're in, good luck getting out.\nPositives:\n+\"Guns and Roses\" is very enjoyable jazz opening, though not having lyrics may turn some people off\n+Unique setting and very in depth characters that show lots of unique attributes\n+Animation and art style was very well done\n+Very good mixture of dark, gloomy tones and upbeat, happy moments\n+I personally enjoy when anime and TV shows and the like use many different storylines that eventually intersect and tie the whole story together\nNegatives:\n-Show is slow to start\n-Even for a supernatural show, some things are just a little too unbelievable, such as a young girl letting strangers into her house, watching them take stuff, and then stand by as they just leave out the window\n-Slightly confusing if you're not paying attention at all times\nBaccano! is a fantastic show that takes a unique setting and great characters and just runs wild with them. The whole show will keep you on your toes and is a very enjoyable and entertaining ride that any fan of anime (or I guess 1930's America) will love.\nAnd that is why Baccano! gets a 9/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    Unique. That is the term that probably comes first to mind when one attempts to describe Baccano! qualitatively. Regardless of the fact that the word is wont to be bandied around to describe any anime series which offers even a shadow of novelty, very few anime truly deserve it (especially in an age where the medium is overrun by mediocre and rather shallow storylines that rely on done-to-death cliches and/or exaggeratedly dark, mysterious settings in a supposed attempt to 'intrigue' viewers). However, Baccano!, both as an anime series and as a work of art, warrants its own special niche due to its sheer idiosyncrasy. It\n          \n        showcases a straightforward yet remarkable story, told in a way that is at the same time incredibly daring and edge-of-the-seat-suspenseful. The result is a one-of-a-kind experience that sets Baccano! quite apart from most other series that populate the anime medium.\nThe crux of Baccano! lies in its story, rather than in its characters-- the story being that of a series of strange and apparently disparate events occurring across three separate timelines and locations, which ultimately coalesce to form a 'big picture' of sorts. Perhaps it would be better to say that the crux of Baccano! lies in its storytelling. The word 'baccano' means 'ruckus' in Italian, and true to its meaning, the plot of Baccano! is unveiled in the disorderly manner of a jigsaw puzzle, with the narration abruptly jumping from one timeline to another, revealing no connection between the individual threads until the big picture is revealed. It is an odd, jerky way of telling a story, but Baccano! carries it through with so much flair and panache that I doubt whether any other style would function in its place. Nor am I confident that this style of narration would work with any kind of story other than the one that Baccano! offers. However, the incredible success of the storytelling does not detract one from the fact that the story itself does have some issues: one, that it is underdeveloped compared to the massive potential it had, and two, the fact that considering the massive buildup throughout 12 of the 13 episodes, the denouement falls a bit flat. But apart from these two problems, there is really nothing to nitpick about a plot that is as neat and pitfall-free as this. Overall 9/10\nThe characters are another department in which Baccano! surprises: it is hardly conceivable that a 13-episode series can develop as many as 18 main characters, besides several side ones as well as Baccano! does. The favorites, of course, are the bumbling thieves-with-hearts-of-gold Isaac Dian and Miria Harvent, who, in addition to forming the most vital connections between different timelines, also provide some comic relief where it is most needed. It is quite incredible how novel they seem despite the good-hearted klutz being one of the most overused cliches in anime. The other characters are also very well thought out, especially the psychopathic Ladd Russo, the charismatic Firo Prochainezo, the sniveling but dangerous Jacuzzi Splot, and the enigmatic Czeslaw Meyer. Despite the sheer number of characters, the show rarely 'spaces out' as most shows with large casts are more prone to do, neither does it rush too much, except for one or two parts towards the end. It makes me quite sad that Baccano! did not have more episodes to do more with its characters; there are shows having ten times as many episodes with less character development. Overall 9/10\nThe art deserves a special mention because the studio in question, Brains Base, does a wonderful job even without the seemingly endless budgets of studios like Kyoto Animation and Madhouse. The art does a great balancing act between being colorful and being dark and full of suspense at the right moments, while the animation is almost uniformly fluid, doing its bit to accentuate the feel of the show. Overall 8.5/10\nThe sound is above average, but does not stand out much except for the opening montage \"Guns and Roses\"(performed by Paradise Lunch) introducing all the characters, which I personally regard as one of my favorite opening sequences in anime. It is stylish, interesting and piques one's attention towards the episode instantly. Overall 8/10\nI see this review is already quite long, but I must throw in a few words about enjoyment as well. This show rarely lets you want to look away or feel bored. It has humor, action, violence and gore (the latter in moderate quantity), suspense, and above all, style. It is a must watch if you are looking for something different. Overall 9/10\nOverall Rating-8.85/10\nBaccano! deserves a watch for being different, and for utilising it well. If you are the kind of person who evaluates a show based on its story, the way the story is told, and the way the characters are utilized, rather than simply based on enjoyment, this is certainly a series, and perhaps THE series, for you.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    To be honest, Baccano! is exactly my type of story. Ensemble larger-than-life cast, frequent perspective changes, messing with chronology, history mixed with fantasy, and an earnestness in its finality. It wraps itself up so nicely and gives frequently great perspectives on the actions of each individual party to form a narrative which is equally hilarious as it is exhilarating.\nBaccano! seems to lay all its cards on the table in the first episode, but don't let that fool you. It's a very clever show not only in subverting expectations but getting you to genuinely forget that you know much of the outcome. It's a narrative which\n          \n        is completely comprehensive if the episodes are watched close enough to each other and the distinctiveness of the characters are more than enough to keep people hooked. Even if you find the comedic relief of Issac and Miria annoying, you can more than put up with them to see others grow and reveal themselves due to their actions.\nSure, a lot of the villainous intent in this series goes a bit off the rails. Both of the \"main villains\" have flimsy motivations and ramble on a little bit too much, but its still incredibly entertaining and not plot-dumpy at all. The voice cast carries a lot of this, with even the scenes which aren't brilliantly animated being granted life by the dub. It's one of those shows where you beg to see how X will interact with Y, and you seem to get it from almost every character combination. Other presentation aspects come mostly as a result of being in New York, with several eras of jazz serving as the soundtrack, sometimes rivaling even Watanabe's use in his works. All of the world gets across what it needs to without really needing to stray too far outside of a few select settings.\nBaccano! is fun, and even though it doesn't really successfully raise too many questions about the human condition like it seems to want, it still feels quite meaningful. The overarching questions are far less important than specific character motivations and actions. It's an anime all about going forward with ideas and understanding them later. It sets itself up for humor with supreme skill and makes a multi-layered gangster world come to life in the course of 13 episodes.\n(I must say though, even though I love it, I have no idea why people truly wish for a sequel. The story is wrapped up with all loose ends settled and trying to draw all those characters back together would probably stretch things a bit too far. I think it's a matter of wanting to see a story told in the same way, and that I am very hopeful for.)\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="                          \n    Baccano is a curious show. It's a tale of mobsters and macabre. A tale of life and death.\nThe story starts off fairly interesting, painting an intriguing picture for the backstories for each of the show's characters. I thought all of the characters (and there are quite a few of them) were introduced really well, giving us a nice glimpse at their personalities, and their relation to each other. However, the characters don't really go much of anywhere from there. They all end up being very basic one-track characters without much depth to them, and none of them grow alongside the story, either. Some of the\n          \n        characters are written in a really enjoyable manner, such as Isaac and Miria, who provide the comic relief, and some of them are fun to watch on screen, such as the joyfully psychotic killing machine, Ladd Russo. However, the characters (even the ones that I liked), while interesting at first, didn't hold my interest for very long, and about halfway through the series, I had grown tired of most of them.\nThat's a problem, because the story spends a lot of time focusing on the interactions between the characters. There is a larger plotline, which I won't spoil, however... it's focused on the characters as well.\nThat's not the real problem with the story for me, though. The problem isn't in the content of the tale (mediocre and anticlimactic as it may be) , but how it's all presented to the viewer. Each episode flips between different timelines of events, many times featuring the same characters, but obviously in different places at different time. They almost never show the time or date of these scenes, so it's completely up to the viewer to figure out which parts took place when and piece it all together. This style of storytelling isn't inherently bad, but in this case it's done for seemingly no benefit whatsoever, as it adds absolutely nothing to the story, just making it needlessly complicated, disjointed, and difficult to follow. Why they chose to present the story in this way is just utterly baffling, and it ruins what would otherwise be a decent tale.\nThe art is somewhat decent. I liked the art style, and the character designs are pretty decent. There's a lot of moments where it looked really nice, but there's also a lot of limited animation being used, making it feel like it was produced on a somewhat middling budget.\nThe soundtrack is pretty forgettable, even though I do think the opening is really catchy. I watched it in English, and the voice actors all did a pretty solid job, but it also wasn't anything that blew me away. The overall audio mix and sound effects used were also effective, but wasn't anything super impressive.\nBaccano is an ambitious experience, but one that ultimately fails when it comes to it's story, which is poorly told, but ends up being propped up by it's halfway decent cast of characters. Still, those characters eventually lose their appeal, making the second half of the show feel like much more of a slog. Everything else is somewhat above average, but the way the show presents the story just becomes pretty difficult to enjoy after only a few episodes in, and that's a big problem.\nOverall, I give Baccano! a 6/10.\n        "},

A pleasing journey through 1930's America that doesn't fail in its quest to introduce an develop an array of characters and tell a compelling story.\nThe story takes place in America, in places like Chicago, during various years of the 1930's, and follows the proceedings of multiple characters who all meet through-out the storyline. Of course, this time period and setting was rife with organised crime and mafia families; the two play a sizeable part in the series. \"The Flying Pussyfoot\", a famous transcontinental train, is host to a number of Baccano's escapades and is the scene of a hostage situation, supernatural phenomena and grizzly\n          \n        deaths. The story is interesting, exciting and filled with many twists and turns.\nThe artwork is done justice and is appropriate for the time period; the characters are dressed accordingly. Nothing is so bright and vibrant as to detract away from the focus of the scene and the detailing on each of the characters and backdrops is done modestly. One of the scenes where the art really shone was when a character know as the \"Rail Tracer\" stood on top of the train, scenery rushing past in the background, with his face crimson with blood accompanied by a wicked smile.\nFor me, the sound was very apparent in the series and it did an excellent job of increasing the atmosphere of any given scene. Especially in scenes where horror and urgency was apparent, the harsh shrills of violins played to bring an airy sense of wariness. Light-hearted scenes were amplified with cheerful music and scenes host to establishing shots of the train were left with but only the sound of rushing wind. \nThe characters are varied and interesting. The two \"comic relief\" characters of Miria and Issac are especially well done and make me laugh with their every remark. Others include the various members of the crime families like the Gandors. All the roles are played well and all add their own little piece to the series.\nWith an incredible and also vast character line-up, coupled with an interesting story that presents it's self variedly, Baccano! makes for a good time.

But you will get used to it about halfway through.  This is NOT episodic you must not miss or skip any episodes.  It is very fast paced and you'll not get bored.\nArt: 10\nThe art is frankly amazing.  Everything from the realistic character models to the setting and blood and guts (well actually there isn't really guts, thankfully).  There is some CG but it fits smoothly in.\nSound: 10\nMost of the music is smooth and jazzy.  It fits\n          \n        the story and mood perfectly, and the intro will be stuck in your head forever.  The voice acting is perfect.  No one is miss cast in the dub.\nCharacter: 9\nThe cast of characters is frankly amazing, however there are some bad characters that take this down to a 9.  And I don't mean you'll hate them because they're meant to be hated, you hate them because they are simply bad.  However you will have many favourites among the cast.  Isaac and Miria are the true main characters and seem almost like they don't fit in the show, but they are probably one of the best characters of the show and they lighten an otherwise dark storyline.  The OVA characters are better though the OVA is overall worse than the main series.\nOverall: 9\nOne of the best bloody series in existence and yet it has a fun atmosphere, a rare combination.  There are OVAs that complete the story nicely though they are not as good quality in story but are better in characters and I would give the OVAs an 8.\nParental caution\nThis show does contain violence, so it's not for young children.  At least they'll learn how to use an automatic rifle *cough* Jacuzzi *cough*. ^_^  It does surprisingly contain a lot of humour, but it's all clean.  Basically if you let your kids watch 24 or Prison Break this show is basically on the same level, just no sex and a little more blood.\n        "},

These violent moments also go in hand with a lot of funny moments,\n          \n        making this the goriest comedy ever. There is not a “plot” in the show, there are different plots that involve different characters, and the characters are the strong point of the show.\n    They are not flesh out, that would be impossible for a 13 episodes show with over 15 characters, but they all feel unique, with their own personality.

It's a show that will always be proof that anime in fact CAN be set outside of Japan. Not only is this a perfectly Americanized anime, but it successfully portrays three timelines that never failed to drop my jaw.\nAt first, I was aware that this show was supposed to be a blast of fun and chaos. And as a result, it was. I tried hard to find a single boring moment, and I failed. It's just that intriguing of an anime.\nWhen comes to\n          \n        characters, they are all likeable in their own unique way, and that definitely shines throughout all 13 episodes of the series. Some mobsters, killers, immortals, and eccentric and idiotic mafia robbers (Isaac and Miria, who may be the most likeable and funny characters ever in anime). Having said all this, there is no “main protagonist.” But nevertheless, there is no need for one as there are three timelines told spontaneously throughout the show.\nStory is tough to review, but I digress; I personally thought the three timelines were perfect in pace, focus, and just pure entertainment. Whenever the job was done in one timeline, the show seamlessly transferred to another timeline. Also, as the show progressed it became much easier to tell what timeline was being portrayed.\nThe part that most people critique about this show is the confusion. The first episode is the epilogue. A fair amount of characters are immortal, but not all. Time makes sudden backflips on the viewer. But isn’t it true that it is normal and acceptable to be slightly confused at the beginning of any story, whether it be one timeline or more than one timeline? Regardless, the show must be watched as a whole to wipe away all of that confusion. Even when confused watching the anime, it never fails to grab interest.\nAmazingly, this show never left out a genre. It had action, lots of comedy, gory horror (WARNING: not for everyone), a wee bit of romance, and countless elements of mystery. And to think, this show is an anime and is better suited in English due to it’s American setting, even for you dub-haters out there.\nOverall, as long as someone can handle a bit a blood shed here and there, he/she must watch it for it is a true work of art. However strange it can get, it still grasps every single emotion you could imagine due to its polygenreness. I don’t even know if that’s a real word, but you get my point.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Baccano! is a genre-busting anime that began as a series of light novels. There are three interchanging plot lines which dominate Baccano!, taking place in 1930, 1931, and 1932.\nThe first episode contains scenes from the endings to each of the three stories. Later episodes jump back and forth, between, and even within the separate stories with little warning. All spiral together to create a surprising, original series that may leave many viewers confused as to what is happening. Even if you stay alert while watching Baccano!, this anime will likely require either a full or partial re-watching if you wish to clarify some story details/subtleties\n          \n        missed due to the skewed timeline.\nOn a positive note, despite the complex plot lines, the way the opening sequence puts names to the faces of all the characters is very helpful–considering the daunting cast list. The beginning cinematic is very reminiscent of Guy Ritchie’s Snatch. However, Baccano! takes the hard-boiled violence of the mafia film genre to new levels throughout this show. Gore alert: characters and scenery often get covered in blood due to the extreme violence that occurs. In one scene, a character “dances” in a flood of gore. Fortunately, the pacing between lighthearted and extreme moments in this anime prevent it from being utterly sickening. That, and knowing most characters are immortal and will recover later.\nAside from this, the strength of Baccano! is in its characters; original author Ryohgo Narita allowed them to run the show. For example, Isaac and Miria’s carefree enthusiasm and antics are a major contribution to the enjoyment of this series. Capturing them, and the rest of this unique, outlandish cast, was essential.\nFor a Japanese animation, the creators did their homework. Taking place in America, this production was impressively devoid of engrish. The Brooklyn accents of the English dub contribute well to the atmosphere of 1930’s mobster culture. Baccano! gushes with style–It’s powerful, but does not come off as heavy-handed. It was enjoyable to connect with a fresh gangster aesthetic.\nBaccano! is recommended for those who have a penchant for mafia-centric films or like a lot of action and intrigue. Also, if you are sick of the “same old,” this show is a great boredom buster. Although this isn’t a horror, if you are squeamish with blood/gore, you may not enjoy this title.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="                          \n    This is the first review I have wrote for this site and I have not wrote many reviews in my time. I'm going to experiment with my format a little as I go through my list and tick off shows that I'm interested in reviewing; so then, without further ado. I'll begin my Baccano! review. \nStory - \nI think the story is well written, spontaneous and original in its' presentation. It has an incredibly fast paced plot but at the same it's not difficult to follow if you're paying attention. You might not understand it right away but I guarantee that you'll understand what's going\n          \n        on as you make your way through it. Baccano! is a series of stories within a story, but it takes it to an entirely new level, allowing them to all come together in the end to round things off. At the same time, it's rather fast paced and can be hard to swallow all at once. \nIt covers a diverse set of characters each with different backgrounds and emotional attachments, they're so different when compared to each other that you might get a little lost from time to time. At the same time though, a lot of these characters are enjoyable and dynamic, that'd make for an excellent stand alone story. Once combined, they create Baccano! \nI would have rated it higher but I'm not fond of the conclusion for this series. It's a good ending with a very strong message that will interest anyone who's keen on writing or reading stories, but that message has never really applied to my understanding of the animé format. It's supposed to be an inconclusive ending, but I never liked inconclusive endings, so sorry Baccano! You're good, but not good enough for me. \nArt - \nI give the art a good score of eight because once again, it's not the best I have ever seen but it's not the worst either. I think Baccano! definitely has an art team that complements the story and characters. They come off as realistic but at the same time, they have that bright and colorful appeal that makes them interesting to watch, even as they're being covered in copious amounts of their own blood! (I'm really not kidding here) Don't check out this show if you don't like blood or gore. I'll warn you, there's a fair bit of mature content matter. If you're not into that sort of thing, then I'd give this a miss. \nSound - \nI don't really think the sound track is memorable but it does suit the rest of the show and the characters. It's well chosen and I have no complaints about it in the slightest. I'm sure that there's quite a few people that would enjoy it. I think at times it comes across as a little too upbeat and cheerful but that's a part of the enjoyment of this series. It's like watching multiple musicals at times! \nCharacter - \nAll of the characters in this show are different and diverse as I pointed out earlier while covering the story; and I find the story for this show isn't the memorable aspect but rather the character's that it's based around, because these are pretty much the show. All of them are unique and even if they're not all interesting, there are certainly some that will make you giggle. I watched this show in subbed and dubbed, often alternating between the two. The dub is done rather well for quite a few of the characters, the voices just complement the characters well. \nYou'll find a good mix of characters; from a mob sociopath to a young immortal boy and then there's the cry baby who has an explosives expert for a girlfriend and these aren't even the cream of the crop! Just throw the mob, immortals and a couple of serial killers onto a train to see what happens! \nEnjoyment - \nIn all honesty, I enjoyed this show from start to finish just because of how dynamic and refreshing it is, mainly because of how well paced everything is. It's fast, upbeat and despite what's happening at any given moment, a comedic spin or satisfying ending will be put on things to retain your sense of enjoyment. It's like watching a serious broad-way musical with a few comedic twists here and there. \nOverall - \nI can't find much to dislike about Baccano! - It's really well done and it's an original concept in comparison to other things I have seen. I walked out of this with no strong attachment to it or its' characters, but it was one of those things that you can sit back, enjoy and then forget about within a week. It doesn't have a lot of staying power but it's entertaining to watch within the moment. I think the message is strong and positive, and I think that if you haven't seen this, you should check it out.\nIf you prefer stories that focus around less characters, and give those characters more time for you to bond with them, then this probably won't be for you. It's a train with a stop and all of the passengers are your main characters. There's no protagonist for this story, because everyone's the protagonist of their own story within the story. \nEnjoy! \n        "},

It's just that it didn't gain popularity as much as it should have as it's arguably one of the best anime series ever made.\nThe first few chapters might be a little confusing, but after that it's a ride that will have you in the edge of your seat. The most important aspect about this anime is the timeline that the characters are living in. It varies alot but the way it handles is just top- notch. \nStory(9)- I won't explain the story as I\n          \n        won't be able to without some spoilers. But if you want a light introduction, you can read the synopsis. Story is really well written with timelines handled perfectly. The story gets even sharper as the  anime progresses. It's indeed a very clever writing with different timelines serving as pieces of puzzles intertwining for the main plot. Although intertwining timelines is a big plus, it also became its downfall as many thought it as confusing. But it's not as confusing as many people say so.\nSound(9)- Love the music although sometimes background music are really quiet for some scenes. Still sound is really a plus in this anime. It helps to keep the mood. It also well expresses the year the anime is set in meaning it really makes you feel like you are in the 70's.\nCharacter(10)- The main highlight of this anime is the characters. There are many and all of them serves a purpose. All the characters are equally interesting. It's up to you to choose the best and the main character. The character development is easily the best i have seen in any anime. So many characters, so little episodes yet they all get enough screentime to not forget about them. Another best thing is the variety of character it displays each with their own unique changing personalities. I can briefly talk about all the characters and how they are amazing but it's better to analyse the characters yourself.\nEnjoyment(10)- It was definitely a blast. Funny, action- packed and suspense. Each episode ends with you wanting more. The story never diverts away from the main plot.It keeps you entertained with it's amazingly intertwined timelines.\nOverall(10)- A MUST WATCH. \nAlways wanted to review this anime with spoilers but I will let non spoiler review satisfy me for now. \n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    Baccano is a 13 episode crime anime revolving around a mix group of protagonists and antagonists. The story focusses on each characters point of view ranging from robberies, immortality, torture, violence, murder and more. \n\nStory: \nIt is hard to generally give a summary of the story for such a mixed bag. The large list of characters for the show makes it hard to follow and with the addition of time skips in every episode makes it even more confusing for the longest time. \nWe are primarily in two separate timelines with a third acting as the back story and stories, the first story takes place\n          \n        back in 1711 where a group of alchemists summon the devil and are given an elixir for immortality. \nThe second story takes place in 1930 where the remaining members of the alchemy group live their respective lives. \nThe third revolves around the hijacking or a train called ‘The flying pussyfoot’ (Best name ever)\nOver the course of 13 episodes we’re presented with the three stories intertwining with one another and despite initial confusion, it all becomes clear by the end of the series. \n\nCharacters: \nIt’s not often that I’ve had to deal with such a large cast of characters in an anime. I will only give two of the main characters for each of the three story arcs. \nMaiza Avaro is one of the alchemists from 1711 who gained immortality through the elixir; the devil only gave Maiza the knowledge of how to re-create the formula for immortality, which he decides against telling the others. This causes conflict with a fellow immortal \nSzilard Quates is the main antagonist for the 1711 and 1930 arc. Obsessed with knowledge and the secret of the elixir Szilard kills most of the alchemists from 1711 to obtain it. \nFiro Prochainezo is a member of Camorra family and is close friends with Maiza. Firo is quite a cheerful and nice guy often not resorting to violence unless necessary. Firo is the main protagonist for the 1930 arc. \nEnnis is Szilard's clone or homunculus created for the sole purpose of serving Szilard and his ambition to obtain the elixir. \nThe final are Isaac and Miria who are the main couple in the 1932 arc. Making the obvious reference to crime partners Bonnie and Clyde the duo are common thieves though remain elusive through their rather unconventional means of stealing. Often using crazy outfits and masks they are mistaken for actors and move from town to town. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that these two are my favourite comedy duo of all time. \nOther characters have pivotal roles in the series appearing in each arc and despite being lesser characters they all get a good deal of screen time and development. \n\nArt: \nThe artwork for the anime wasn’t that great. A lot of the time it was dark colours to suit the crim theme. Brain Base were the studio for this one having also created works such as My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU, Blood Lad and One Week Friends all of which are very good works, though not really memorable through the art. \n\nSound: \nThe upbeat jazz sound in Baccano had me reminiscing of my time watching Cowboy Bebop. The opening song \"Gun's and Roses\" was good, but every time I played it in my head I kept thinking of ‘Tank’ the ending \"Calling\" was nice, but I didn’t listen to it all the way through. \n\nEnjoyment:\nDid I enjoy Baccano? For the most part, yes I did. I always love a good black comedy and with the violent murders of men, women and children not being held back in the show along with the comedy aspects of Miria and Isaac it all balanced itself out well. \nThe flaws in the show could be the unanswered questions of some characters. For example who are the two characters at the beginning of episode one and what relevance did they have? What was the whole Rail tracer and Chane Laforet about? Is Ladd Russo immortal? Would Ladd Ruso have killed Chane had the Rail tracer not interrupted? What happened to the rest of the characters that are up to the date 2001? Is Dallas Geonard still alive? A few questions which may be answered in the three OVA episodes I will watch later. \n\nOverall: \nOverall I think Baccano did an excellent job with the large cast of characters and the interesting time skips which could have gone wrong, but it all came together into a nice tidy finish. The story was done well although it was split into three different parts and all links together nicely. I can’t find much fault other than the standard artwork and the few unanswered questions regarding some characters. \nI give Baccano a 7 out of 10 and a recommendation to watch it if you are a fan of crime and black comedy anime. \nAlternate recommendations are Cowboy Bebop where a group of bounty hunters are chasing people for any crimes and it has a kickass soundtrack. The second anime recommendation is Gungrave, having supernatural themes and organised crime. Either of these two will be a better alternative to Baccano. \nThanks for reading guys, have a nice day!

It is very well written and extremely unique and is everything by Ryohgo Narita(the author of the books, which I read). The plot is basically in every story by Narita chaotic things happening to unrelated people that are all connected and will eventually clash into one huge chaotic situation in one place. This story has a unique atmosphere as it centers on American crime organizations in 1930s. Accents done amazingly by the dub cast really capture the whole feel of the great depression nicely. With the addition of supernatural immortals, homunculi, and wonderful ships baccano has something\n          \n        for everyone. The story following Eve is rather boring however, because it was adapted poorly due the drug centered plot in the 4th novel. The catchy jazz and extreme violence makes a wonderful combination of fun. The characters are unlike any others and so are their names. The ships will become your otps. If you want after watching book translations can be found online for free. Baccano is a 100% 10, a must watch show. Everything is adapted well but Eves stuff.\n        "},

In that regard, Baccano! is the opposite of a normal story, specially for anime.\nAiring initially in 2007, Baccano!'s last three episodes were released straight-to-DVD and are recognized as specials.  It was produced by the studio Brain's Base and directed by Takahiro Omori, a veteran director who later went on to direct Durara!! and Hotarubi no Mori e.\nIt  is important to note that Baccano! is not predictable, it is frequently throwing curve-balls and keeps the viewer on the edge of\n          \n        their seat. But it is not only composed of high-tension moments and horror, the story also manages to be funny, light-hearted and even touching when it needs to be.\nSpeaking of characters, these are (most of) them. Czeslaw Meyer is an immortal who is forever stuck as a child, Firo Prochainezo is a suave gangster, Isaac and Miria are a duo of robbers who possess incredible luck, Claire Stanfield is a mysterious man with a strange sense of justice, Chane Laforet is a mute assassin, Jacuzzi Splot and Nice Holystone are lovers and lead a gang, Eve Genoard is a kid in search of her brother, Ladd Russo is a crazy man fixated on killing his wife and, finally, Ennis is a homunculus who doesn have any emotion. These are only some of the important characters, not all of them.\nDespite the huge cast, it is very easy to identify them because of the incredible character design, that makes one glimpse enough to recognize them. All of them are unique and have as much charm as the setting. But what is truly impressive is how masterfully they are explored in such a short runtime. Pretty much every character has a substantial amount of depth and evolves during the anime.\nBaccano! knows how to use its setting to its advantage. It feels like a gangster movie and shows a great fun and jazzy side of the Prohibition Era of the United States. A big part of that is how authentic everything looks, from the clothes to the guns, but another thing that helps is the soundtrack, composed mostly of jazz and blues songs that fit the setting perfectly.\nThe one thing that didn't impress nearly as much as everything else was the art. Don't get me wrong, the character design was great and some of the more focused shots were beautiful, but every time it went for a wider shot, the art crumbled and became underwhelming.\nAs I love gangster and crime movies and supernatural twists, I felt right at home while watching Baccano!.  It was an incredible ride of fun, comedy and tension that I won forget any time soon. Also, skip the specials.\nIf you have similar tastes to me, you will love it. If you enjoy complex stories that can manage to surprise even the most seasoned viewers, you will find a lot to enjoy. Likewise, if you hate these things or simply aren't looking for them, you probably won't enjoy it.\n        "},

At just 16 episodes, this anime is in some ways a breeze but also capable of losing you in its whirlwind of trying to beef up a not so interesting story with a wild delivery.\nThis is an anime that is lauded by many in the community as a special one. The storytelling is held in high regard and is well liked by so many, so I decided\n          \n        to see what the hype was about.\nI’m all for an unorthodox approach to story telling, and I was half expecting it as I started watching Baccano. I also didn’t know that it came from the same author, studio, and director as Durarara which might have helped prepare me, but either way, I sat and waited to for the show to unravel and show its true colors. It’s clear that this was a guessing game for them and their first attempt at putting together an anime of this sort. \nOverall, I was disappointed by the delivery of the multiple storylines as the anime progressed from episode to episode. The first 5 or 6 episodes are there to help set up the stories, the characters in each and give us inklings of how they may come to be related to each other. The anime never really follows through with the setup. This may be the director and author’s intent, but the anime comes off as several chapters of several different books being shown simultaneously, leaving us to piece it all together and form the cohesive narrative. I found myself lost and then found, and then confused at what the stories had to do with one another. None of the timelines ever really feed into the others directly. The separate chapters instead serve as backstory and give some sort of context to the others which makes the anime a little difficult to watch. It is stuck between wishing to tell a series of short stories and having an overarching plotline drive the show. This indecisiveness really made the show hard to enjoy.\nWithin each of the timelines and separate narratives, there were interesting events and action sequences that drew me in, but they all get cut too short and there is no real chance to dive into them, appreciate them, and speculate on how they can progress.\nThis same flaw is applied to the characters. There are quite a few characters introduced in the anime. Some occur in all the different timelines and narratives while some only occur in one. It becomes hard to understand any of them or even feel and stand behind any of them. Their appearances and interactions are so fleeting that they come off as nothing other than props used to make the anime that much more convoluted.\nI tried to read a little bit the way the story was assembled to understand a little, and the anime even ends with the characters almost breaking the fourth wall, telling that the story they are apart neither begins nor ends, so it could be seen that this messy, incoherent method of storytelling is built into what the anime is, and a part of what makes Baccano, Baccano.\nI think the biggest downfall of this anime is that it isn’t long enough to see the threads come together to form the cloth it is hinting at. At the end, it left the feeling of dissatisfaction and had me wondering what exactly I had just watched.\nThere are good moments of the anime that stick out a little when compared to the plot. The music and art are surprisingly nice. The music is fitting for the time and a nice departure from the soundtracks of most anime. The art is clean, with subdued colors that fit the narrative. The animation is pretty spot on as well. For an anime coming in the mid 2000’s, it’s very crisp and lively. The voice acting is pretty great as well. Having watched a few episodes in Japanese and then the rest dubbed, I may say the dubbed adds a little authenticity to the anime. The accents and ways of speaking just feel right when it is in English, especially when the setting is considered.\nI wouldn’t recommend this anime to just anyone. You have to be very willing to sit, pay attention, and not mind being lost the entire way. Some may really enjoy that sort of story, but I found it hard to enjoy even the most basic plots in the show. If nothing else, this anime is a radical display on how to tell a story, whether it be done in a good way or a bad way.\n"},

Baccano could have easily lost track of itself and ended full of plot holes but it stood strong til the very\n          \n        end. Baccano isn't just a comedy, it isn't just a drama, it's a piece of media that anyone with any tastes could get into.\nART 10: simply put the art style is fantastic, most characters in this show have unique character designs that make it easy to tell who is who. The show made you believe that the show was set in the violent ages of America.\nSOUND 10: If there is one soundtrack that best relates to the great Cowboy Bebop, it would be Baccano. The Jazz and hectic pacing of the music beautifully accentuate the action and overall feel. The op is amazing, and I may just say it's better than Cowboy bebops\nCHARACTERS 10: Baccano may have the largest cast of main characters in any show, and EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM ARE FANTASTIC. Even the \"annoying\" characters are lovable, even the disturbing characters are people you'd want to chill with, and for its cast, that's FANTASTIC.\nENJOYMENT 10: Baccano overall is fun and engaging. From start to finish your enjoying yourself non stop, never once did I think about dropping BACCANO!\nOVERALL 200: BACCANO should be the standard of anime, it has everything you want, whether you enjoy anime or not Baccano is entertaining."},

Baccano! Is basically an anime that takes place over many decades. Where this anime triumphs is the satisfying blend of realism and fantasy. The story while very weird due to the time-skips, is detailed,fun,and frankly just ridiculous in the best possible way. The characters are all well developed and interesting with my favorites being Jacuzzi Splot and Firo Prochainezzo. The whole set of subjects this anime tackles go from the mafia,demons, and even immortality(which plays a major part in the plot). The setting is also great\n          \n        being in the prohibition era and the English voice work definitely captures the raw essence of the time period and was generally a nice touch.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    How do I even begin to describe a show like this? This is a show that defies all practical ways of storytelling. No main protagonist, a nonlinear story, and a huge cast of unconventional characters. You’d think that all these risks would harm the show, but not only does Baccano! stand as an enjoyable anime, but even possibly one of the greatest gangster stories ever told! It’s an entertaining show straight from the first few minutes of it’s beginning, and it stays enjoyable till the very end.\nThis is a tale about gangsters, immortals, psychopaths, and “The Flying Pussyfoot”. Welcome to 1930’s America! Our story begins,\n          \n        oddly enough, at the very end, with everything already been said and done. By the end of the first episode we already know how everything ends, we know who lives, and who doesn't. It seems weird at first, and it does kill off some suspense during parts of the show since, well, we already saw what happened to these characters, but luckily, that isn't Baccano!’s goal. Instead, we get to see just how all this happened to our character, and that’s probably one of the show’s greatest strengths.\n As we watch, the mystery unfolds, and we get a better idea of just what really happened here. The show does an absolutely great job connecting it’s multiple stories together, showing us the big picture. Events which seem completely unrelated are woven together, leaving no questions unanswered. At first, this does seem rather confusing, and honestly, it can be at times. This isn't helped with the fact that the story takes place in the span of several different years, with characters appearing in multiple parts. As the show progresses, you will get a better grasp of this unique way of storytelling, but it does take a while, which does lead to some problems. \nAnother great thing about this show is it’s cast of insane characters. Like I said before, there is no main character, instead the story is presented through the eyes of several different characters. The best part is that all these characters are incredibly distinct, each of them genuinely feeling like fully realized characters, rather than just cardboard cutouts. There’s the hilarious duo Miria and Isaac, the crybaby Jacuzzi, the violent hit man Ladd Russo, and so much more. And somehow, in only 13 episodes, a lot these characters manage to get enough screentime to feel developed and unique in their own right. I do wish that some of these characters did get more time for themselves to feel more thought out, like Rachel, who doesn't even get that much screentime until the last few episodes. There are several other characters that I don’t think got enough development either, leaving them to stay more or less the same through the whole course, and that does hurt the show at some points. Still, I found every character enjoyable to watch, and it’s a cast of characters I don’t think I’ll be forgetting anytime soon.\nWhat can I say about the animation and art style that hasn't been said before? It was produced by studio Brain Base, and it’s beautiful. Baccano! captures the jazz setting perfectly. The characters all look like they were ripped off of old gangster movies, and they have a more distinct look compared to other anime. The scenery also helps to put you in into America’s Chicago, you could tell a lot of work went into make this art style blend in with the setting, and the animation itself is very fluid. The action scenes in particular are impressive,and their are tons of them. Characters movements feel real, and only rarely did I feel as though the animation fell at some parts.\nNow, for the the sound of Baccano!, which I can easily say does an incredible job putting the viewers engrossed with this world. The musical score, which was done by Makoto Yoshimori, is comprised of mostly jazz like songs and orchestrated tracks, really just further pushing the setting of America’s 1930's. Saxophones, pianos, violins, trumpets, and brass instruments, this show uses all of them to it’s advantage. A particular favorite track of mine is Baccano!’s OP, Guns and Roses, an amazing song that I look forward to every time an episode begins, and I’m sure you will too. \nAs for the voice acting, this is an amazing dub. The English voices feel so perfect with these characters, especially give the fact that the setting is America after all, but that’s not what just make the voices feel perfect. The acting gives all of the already fantastic characters a breath of life, helping them all feel more distinct and identifiable. You could tell which character is which just by hearing their voices for a few seconds, and that’s amazing considered the large amounts of characters this show has.\nI enjoyed the hell out of Baccano!, it’s a great blend of mystery, action, comedy, and even a bit of horror. The jazzy setting is fantastic, the premise is unconventional, and it’s far more unique than other shows because of that. The story may be hard to follow at first, and the huge cast of characters may intimidate you, but once you can get through those problems, you get a show that is truly remarkable in almost every sense, and it’s a show I can’t help but to recommend to anyone interested.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Baccano! Where to begin. Stating that seems the obvious way. Slightly amusing given that I didn’t have the beginning in mind as I wrote that. So, the fact that I loved it may be a place to start, but should I not begin with some information on it? Well part of the joy is in drawing your own conclusions as the story progresses so even telling you the most basic information from the story steals a bit. I’ll start with the format. \nBaccano (I shall be leaving off its exclamation point from here on) jumps around quite a bit (with nice transitions, the opening will\n          \n        give you an idea of what you’re getting into), and you won’t have a good idea where the story is going until it’s nearly over. I found this annoying at first, “who cares about the dinosaurs, I want to hear about the trains” I say to myself (don’t misunderstand, this show doesn’t have dinosaurs in the literal sense) as it jumps, yet again, leaving me with a cliff hanger revolving around the shows most interesting characters (which you will find, as the story progresses, is anyone with a name). For me however, it got to the point where I didn’t care where it jumped to, for I knew something, at the very least someone, interesting awaited me there.\nThe characters, you would not believe the characters. The characters in Baccano are one of its strongest points; they range so far apart, from their philosophies to their attitudes, all of them crazy in their own little way. Characters who are good and bad all at once. Characters, all of them unique. Characters with a kind of arrogance that seems to be the same as strength.  I’m still having trouble decide who I like the most.\nThe show’s energy may be its strongest point. Much of its energy is drawn from its characters, however the upbeat music and fast paced storytelling are what, I believe, do most of the work. I try not to make this comparison, but it seems I must. The energy is very reminiscent of Gurren Lagann, and though I wasn’t sure it could happen, I believe Baccano bests Gurran Lagann on its own ground.\nThe plot is generally discussed, I don’t want to give details away, but I felt that the plot was there for everything else in Baccano to have something to do. Basically, when I remember back to the show, I won’t be remembering the plot.\nIn Baccano, I found not a single flaw, however I must point out a few things:\nViolence. This show had quite a bit of violence, and much of it is gory. If you absolutely cannot stand such things, then you should avoid this show. However, if your dislike isn’t too great, please, put it aside, I believe there is something great here.\nAudio. I watched the subbed, and I recommend you do as well. I’m a bit biased in this regard, however, I watched the subbed all the way through, and found something great. I watched several scenes with the English dub and found that the voices do not have the same energy that I got from the Japanese. Again, I am biased, and a friend of mine (the one who recommended the series to me) saw it dubbed, and thoroughly enjoyed it, but if the audio is an option for you, I strongly advise you pick the Japanese.\nThank you for reading this, and please forgive mistakes I made in writing this (I’m most certain that I butchered the usage of the comma, however, if commas are breaks, then I feel that is where they belong). I hope you give Baccano a try. It is the only thing I will allow into the highest ranking alongside Clannad: After Story, for completely different reasons."},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    Baccano is the quintessential mafia anime.  It's such a perfect portrayal of the Hollywood's vision of the mafia era that you'd be forgiven for thinking Narita co-authored it with an American. Baccano, like it's name (meaning \"ruckus\" in Italian) implies, is a loud but indirect romp through the prohibition era united states. Just be ready for all the gore. \nthe artwork is beautiful, and fits the atmosphere perfectly while adding realism. Character designs are very realistic looking yet each one is unique. For better or for worse Baccano also has some of the most detailed depictions of gore that I've seen in an anime\n          \n        of it's type. It's not that they go out of their way to drench the screen in blood (cough Hellsing cough), but rather that they refuse to pull any punches when it comes to depicting death. Want to know what a human arm looks like as it's being ground to a pulp on moving railroad tracks? Apparently Bacanno thought you did! All joking aside, the realistic depictions of violence add a lot of weight to the fight scenes. \nStory-wise, Baccano has an unconventional take on storytelling. The story is framed as two investigators looking into the events surrounding a government coverup of an incident that occurred on board the transcontinental train \"the Flying Pussyfoot\" (yes, it's really called that. And you will be hearing it allot). As such, the story tends to jump around from year to year as they dig up new facts, dealing with three key plot arcs that occur in each year. It gets confusing first, but as the show goes on you begin to form timeline in your head without even intending to. \nThe Characters are great, though some of them could have been fleshed out a bit more. But when you divide screen time by that many characters, certain sacrifices have to be made.\nThe audio is great. Swing and jazz form the bulk of the soundtrack, with turbulent violins and fiddles used where saxophone wouldn't fit properly. The voice acting in the sub is passable, but you are truly missing out if you don't watch the dub, which is perhaps one of the best dubs I have ever seen. \nBaccano is a blast, and its less than 20 episodes. You are missing out if you don't watch this series. \n        "},
		{["score"]=2,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    Baccano joins a long growing list of highly overrated and extremely annoying anime that includes but is not limited to Neon Genesis Evangelion, Fate/Zero (and most of Gen Urobuchi’s other work), Mawaru Penguindrum, Puella Magi Magika Madoka (another Urobuchi work), Bakemonogatari and Shinsekai Yori. \nMost of these anime have two things in common: first they are a jumbled mess of ideas that are jarringly out of place when viewed all together as a whole and secondly it becomes clear after you have watched long enough that the writer(s) got carried away/bored/wrote themselves into corners and lost the plot (Neon Genesis especially).\nThis anime was produced by\n          \n        Brains Base who also animated Durarara!! What Bacanno and Drrrr (alternate name for the other afore mentioned Brains Base anime) have in common are a large cast of characters and non-linear story-telling.\n People rate this over Drrr, but in my opinion Drrr was a lot better. For one thing Drrr had likeable interesting characters. For another, Drrr was about the inhabitants of a city and the city itself (Ikebukoro). Also Drrr had Celty, a headless Dullahan whose voice actress was Inaban from Kokoro Connect (lovely soothing voice that).\nThe non-linear style of storytelling got out of hand. A good story is supposed to be constantly progressing and changing not hopping back and forth between a scene on a train at night time in 1931 and a street or house in 1930 during the day. \nUgh, it was a horrid viewing experience. Watch Durarara instead. That was funny as well as touching and deep in places (how is it possible for a viewer to identify with a character that is headless???)\nP.S if after six episodes you don’t care about a single character or event that’s taking place on the screen before you an anime deserves to be dropped, right?

It's a rare thing - smooth fighting scene. I assure you - movements in this anime are simply perfect. Details were made with such care that a viewer can feel the atmosphere of a time and space in which anime take place.\nSound - catching! Even if you don't like music from prohibition era in America, this soundtrack will definitely appeal to you. Music suite action extremely well - especially during fights and &bdquo;quick&rdquo; scenes. It's lively and optimistic, but be careful - it's also addictive. Don't be surprise if you decide to buy a CD with it.\nCharacters - varied! It's pretty unusual to put so many characters into 13-episode anime. At the beginning it's impossible to remember all of them, but after few episodes you'll definitely love or hate some of them. The variety of characters is pretty impressive - from humorous couple (you'll die laughing because of them) to psychopathic killers.\nOverall - Baccano! is one of a few anime, which are on my &bdquo;must watch&rdquo; list. The story itself is enough to say this anime is great - but brilliant animation, well-chosen music and dozens of  extraordinary characters make this series perfect.\n        "},

Well you get the fun ride known as Baccano!\nBaccano! is a sixteen episode Action/Comedy anime based on the light novel by Ryohgo Narita and published by Media Works. The anime is from Brain’s Base Studio and was dubbed by Funmation. It originally aired from July to November of 2007.\nEach of the stories in the series involves several unrelated plots intersecting and crossing each other as events spiral farther and farther out of control. Immortal alchemists, mafia operated speakeasies, and many other elements of pulp fiction mashed\n          \n        together for a world straight out of the movies (Anime News Network).\nThe style and animation is simply amazing! A lot of times when you have an Eastern culture try to depict American history and it comes out completely wrong. With Baccano!, the artists really did their homework and were able to create exactly what we would come to imagine from the 1930s. The art is perfect, the music is appropriate, and even the characters are amazing. The animation isn’t 100% top notch, but, honestly, I didn’t really care because I was just so interested in the story itself.\nSpeaking of which, Baccano! takes a very unique way of telling the story. The series involves three years, but not in sequential order. The entire series mixes the years all together, making you completely lost in trying to make sense of it; however, it keeps you on your toes and you’ll have figured it all out by the end of the 12th episode. The three years and events that Baccano! centers around are:\n1930: Mafia and the Elixir of Life\n1931: Flying Pussyfoot incident\n1932: Search for Dallas Genoard\nAfter the 12th episode, it kinda loses interest a little. Most of it take place after the Flying Pussyfoot incident, and mostly revolving around Chane and her sudden romance with Claire Stainfield; which, by the way, comes out of no where. Does it work, sure. But does it make it interesting, not really. Also, fair warning, there is a good amount of blood and gore in the series. From torture to cut fingers. Thankfully, it’s not used excessively, unlike some anime use of fan service *cough* High School of the Dead. Now, I should mention a couple parts involving the main characters of this series. In the first episode, they take about twelve minutes to introduce the characters you have to keep an eye out for. This is done by a couple members from the Daily Days, information brokers who will come up several times in the series. The second way you know about the main characters in the show is the opening theme. It’s not only catchy, but it tells you the characters the story revolves around, and also points out certain moments that will be relevant in the upcoming episode; so you can’t skip it. In order of the opening there’s Isaac, Miria, Firo, Maiza, Keith, Berga, Luck, Sziland, Ennis, Lua, Ladd, Chane, Nice, Jacuzi, Eve, Dallas, and Czeslaw.\nAnd on that note, the characters are just amazing! Wether they’re gangsters, French, or just goofy robbers, all the main characters are fun to watch. I can’t really say if there’s any development, but it’s mostly cause of how the story is told. There are some parts that aren’t really talked about, like the romance between Firo and Ennis, but it doesn’t effect the show in a really bad way. Again, Baccano!’s real purpose is the complex story it gives. As for favorite characters, it’s a toss up between Ladd Russo and the duo of Isaac and Miria. Ladd for his insane killing obsession, coupled with the pure joy he gets out of it; and Isaac and Miria for their bumbling, light hearted comic relief.\nWhile watching the English dub of Baccano!, I came to a very big conclusion. This is the best anime dub I have ever heard! The casting choices from FUNimation are the best I’ve ever seen them do. And, when you really think about it, they’re not just voicing regular people, but immigrants, gangsters, and crazy people. Some of the accents are a bit forced, but it doesn’t hurt the series too much. There’s also a good mix of veterans and new voice actors. Veterans such as Caitlin Glass (Black Cat), Colleen Clinkenbeard (Full Metal Alchemist), Jason Liebrecht (Eden of the East), Monica Rial (High School of the Dead), Todd Haberkorn (xxxHolic), and Carrie Savage (Paranoia Agent). As for the newbies, you have Bryan Massey as Ladd Russo, Joel McDonald as Jacuzzi Splot, and Maxey Whitehead as Czeslaw Meyer. I’m hoping to hear more from these newbies in the future!\nAll in all, Baccano! is an exciting ride during the 30’s with a few added twists to keep the plot interesting. The characters are fun to watch, even bad guys like Ladd Russo, and the time period is portrayed perfectly. Once you get past the jumbled up story line and the gore, it’s a fun anime to watch and I highly recommend it.\n        "},

The story is good, not excellent. But the way it is shown is way better than excellent. If you think Haruhi's sequence is messed up, this would be the ultimate mess-up. You'll get different snipets of different characters in different times doing different things. But, they are all related.

The jazzy opening credits fits the show very well, though the ending didn't really leave much of an impression on me.\n[characters]\nIf this show only had the characters and nothing else, I would still watch it. That's how awesome the characters are, though having a good plot that ties in all these amazing characters just made it to the top for me. The most daring part of this show does not come from it's totally fragmented stories requiring you to piece them together, but rather from the overwhelmingly HUGE cast of characters, all of whom can be the main character. This must be the only show that did this, and did it this successfully.\n[animation]\nOne word for it, excellent. The details, lighting, motion, and almost anything you can think of is handled excellently.\n[in the end]\nIf you think you're up to the challenge, go fot it. I'm sure you won't regret.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    First, let's look over something which you may find weird. Why exactly are all of the scores 10 but overall it's a 9? Well, because of the golden rule: if something starts off crap, then it's fine to write it off as crap. If something can't capture your attention enough, then of course you're not going to continue it.\nTo clarify, Baccano does not start off crap. It wouldn't have all 10s if it did. However, it is really confusing. It jumps around everywhere, across multiple times, multiple stories and multiple characters. That's also part of its strength, as everything is tied up amazingly by the\n          \n        end. Almost every single character feels like they get their time to shine. Still, because of the difficulty to get into it, I can't go giving the series a 10.\nSo, everything about this series was still amazing. Baccano has possibly the best comic relief characters ever made, and some of the most badass characters ever made as well. Each storyline is captivating (except maybe Eve's, but even that was still good) the art was very nice to look at and characters all looked unique, and its opening theme is one of the best in all anime.\nFinally, Baccano gets better each time you re-watch it. I'm not even kidding. Each time you re-watch, you get a better idea of how earlier events in the anime line up, and you enjoy all the more.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    A drastic and welcome departure from your typical anime formula, Baccano is a fun, confounding mess of pandemonium, sinister absurdity, and delight. And what else would you expect from a series whose title literally means “ruckus”?\nStory: The jumbled storytelling of Baccano! makes the series a joy to watch yet incredibly difficult to express. Baccano! is told through a series of non-sequential flashbacks taking place primarily between 1930 and 1932 in the fictionalized Prohibition-era America represented in films like The Untouchables or Miller’s Crossing (though the constant smattering of dark irony and grisly humor makes it more of a cinematic counterpart to the stylized gangster movies\n          \n        of Tarantino and Guy Ritchie). Most of the story revolves around an incident that takes place in 1931 aboard a transcontinental train bound for New York named the Flying Pussyfoot. Three separate groups simultaneously attempt to hijack the train for various purposes and thus, the unstoppable engine of death, destruction, and black laughs commences. Interwoven into this already complicated scenario are separate storylines involving a mafia turf war, immortal alchemists, and a young girl searching for her ne’er-do-well brother.\nCharacters:\nFor a thirteen-episode anime, the cast of characters is comparatively immense; between the twelve main characters and countless supporting characters, this anime gives you a lot to keep track of. However, from the brilliant comedic duo Isaac and Miria, to the zany and completely psychopathic Ladd Russo, there isn’t a single character that isn’t somehow likeable. Additionally, the large cast serves to add to the constant sense of tension because, without a “main” protagonist, there exist no guarantees that any of the characters will make it safely through the entire series. The downside regarding the characters and (generally the series as a whole) is, given the limited time-span, you aren’t given nearly enough time to really get to know such a broad ensemble cast (a problem that the subsequent specials did little to fix).\nSound:\nFast-paced jazz tracks make up the majority of the Baccano soundtrack and generally fit the show flawlessly. While adding even more vitality and polished style to a show already bursting with energy, the use of jazz and swing pieces reinforce the shows authenticity and place it more firmly in the time period. The dubbed voice acting is generally solid, with characters possessing different accents corresponding to their various origins and the voice actors pulling off said accents to different degrees. However, each character does sound completely unique, with each voice actor bringing in something new to the table.\nAnimation:\nThe animation is of high quality throughout, with consistent fluidity, well-shaped characters, and distinctive style. The opening animation is absolutely brilliant (so much so that I never skipped it even once while watching the show). The way violence is handled also deserves to be underscored; every fight scene is animated with a fluidity and artistic flair that is at once enthralling, horrifying, and oftentimes even a bit humorous.\nOverall:\nBaccano! is pure, unadulterated chaos; anarchy dispensed with a furtive underlying structure that eventually manages to jam all of its various fragments together to form a thrilling, morbidly humorous whole that is ultimately incredibly satisfying. The complex plot and enormous cast, combined with relatively strong dubbing, clean animation, and impeccable musical score makes this a must-see series for fans of the American gangster genre or anyone simply looking to have a bloody good time."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    Baccano! is a really neat, unique anime. To suffice, it manages to squash the stories of 20+ people into just 13 episodes. Trust me, you won't forget it.. I shudder to think of what might have happened had I not read Baccano's summary on MAL before I watched the series, although other people might say that it takes the fun out of it if you do. \nStory:\nLike I said, all the characters act independently of their own will and interact in unpredictable ways. The closest I can come to explaining it is something called a ROC Survivor Contest, where ten characters, each written by a\n          \n        different author, come together to affect the plot and move the story forward. It's also very intricate; pay attention to the dates, because they WILL matter. \nArt: \nIt's pretty darn good for a smallish animation studio. Despite the vast amount of characters, I had no trouble telling them apart; and, might I add, not just because they had different hair colors ;) Their attire is also comfortably designed around the era of the series as well. \nSound: \nI didn't remember anything bad about the voice acting or background music, which is good. The OP remains one of my favorites of all time, and voice actors seem suited to their role. \nCharacters:\nHere's where the series really shines. All the characters are so unique, so different, from varying backgrounds and social classes, that it's delightful to watch them interact with one another. There's the old, the young, the old young one, and so many more. There are characters you will hate (like Szilard) and others you will adore (Firo and Ennis! Plus Jacuzzi.) There's someone for everyone. :) They all have depth as well, and you can see their code of ethics through their actions. \nEnjoyment: \nThis is one of the few animes I have marathoned. Believe me, 13 episodes fly by very quickly when there's so much going on. So if you have a night free and don't mind staring at the computer for a few hours, watch Baccano! \n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    A very unserious review to follow:\nAs you might have suspected if you are prophet this review will not be serious, though I think someone mentioned that already. Maybe you're just having a deja vu. \nAnyway, you have already seen that I have rated Baccano! as a 10. Good for you for being observant. I'm sure one day this skill of yours will lead to you to the secret passageway to eternal prosperity in the land of sunshine, hot guys/ chicks and ice cream. Until that moment, gannbatte! \nSo what makes Baccano! great? Well I guess our first order of business in establishing the reasons would\n          \n        be to figure out what \"great\" means, to set up the parameters of \"great\" things and discover the formula that lieth beneath what might appear to alies a mental malfuction, but is commonly referred to on Earth as laughter, ejoyment, merriment, rire, смях, skratt, gelach and ਹਾਸੇ in different regions of the planet. \nSo I shall start with a thought experiment - I dislike the excrements of animals while flies seem to find them cozy. Empirically speaking, this would suggest that the definition of  \"great\" is species-dependent. Further thought experiments (some people thought \"Nazism\" was \"great\", others not so much) reveal that it is not only species-dependent but also completely idiosyncratic. So it would appear that our whole search was fruitless and I cannot reveal why, objectively, Baccano is great. \nIt still is, though. One reason to watch it would be that it 95% of people think that it is more entertaining that them (the other 5% are in denial or in the process of mysteriously disappearing). So why is Baccano! entertaining?\nWell, first of all it's about gangsters. Okay. Second it's about immortal gangsters. Mhm. Third, it's about a gang war with immortal gangsters with alchemists, at least four types of psychopaths (a solipsist who actually believes in solipsism, the girl with the biggest unrealized hard-on for her father in history, a guy who is so sadistically funny that he would make Jack the Ripper shit his pants and a guy whose name is Jacuzzi, whose girlfriend is a bombfreak), a train called \"The Flying Pussyfoot\", a wide array of other characters, who all play a role in the magnificent story spanning three timelines, two thieves who are the stupidest, funniest and most fortunate people on the planet and who somehow bring everything together, practically no plot holes, plenty of action and, quite possibly, the best OST in any anime I've watched. \nIt is important to note that, at the beginning, you will understand nothing of what is going on - as they say in a little green book \"Don't Panic!\" - very soon you will think you understand what's going on and will keep thinking this past every plot twist you didn't expect until the very end. Beware of the narrative style though, it is completely nonlinear, with a omniscient narrator butting in here and there, oh and do notice the names of the episodes - it's actually a fun thing how they tie in with what goes on around the show. \nOverall, why is Baccano! great? It's great because it has been meticulously polished down to every detail, it's great because I watched it from 22:00 - some time in the early morning - it's great because I woke up my brother several times laughing uncontrolably at indecent hours of the night and it's great because there's just something there that makes you think that despite all the goofing around going on (and there's a whole lot of that) there's actually something meaningful going on too.\nPotatoes. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Baccano! along with Cowboy Bebop and Trigun (and let's not forget Hellsing) came very highly recommended to me. I can now see why.\nNeither the story nor the storytelling are formulated and they largely deviate from that which we expect to be 'normal', at least for an anime. \nIt starts with two narrators, or the people we expect to be narrators though they stick with us only through the first episode after which they disappear until the last episode. In such way the story could be called chiastic, but considering we have multiple characters whose point of view is also there it could be called parallel.\n          \n        Either way both structures are present, the later more prominent, with time jumps and scene cutting, all done in favor of better storytelling. \nOften we can see one scene being told from multiple points of view in minimum,  thought that form of storytelling is applied to the main story plot of the anime (maximum). The form (the time jumps and scene cutting) can sometimes be annoying but we always see what would have come next if the story was linear. \nAs for the plot, it's interesting to see so many characters surrounding one thing that pulls them all together, especially using something like the Cure. I did not foresee the alchemy in this anime and on that part, it felt a bit lacking. Not in any bad way, I just wanted to see more of it, and perhaps more of the 'demon' from which it all started. The end appeased me a bit on that end. \nConsidering the plot is such that it pulls all kinds of characters and ties them to one omnipresence, I'd say that the creators did a great job in forming the characters. Each and every one of them have their own personalities, aspirations, disappointments, and I'm not even going to go into the worldbuilding because for an anime of 13(16) episodes it does an amazing job considering nothing is explained outright. However the number of characters can leave you a bit confused, especially because it's important you actually learn their names so you could understand what's going on. \nThe comedy of the piece is phenomenal. It's rationed with the action quite well and the gore isn't overpowering. Comically, one character is named Vino (which in my language means wine) who embodies his name quite perfectly considering he's covered in red pretty much the whole anime. I enjoyed the wordplay very much.  (As did I enjoy the cast of Luck Gondor. Takehito Koyasu is my favorite voice actor, with his characteristic deep voice that can't be forgotten, nor mistaken for another.)\nThe portrayal of the characters is done nicely both by the art and sound. The art and coloring is done is such a way that it puts you in the 30s easily. The sound and the animation are completely in sync and as such compliment the action. \nThe opening, which is probably the most prominent factor, is wordless just like in Cowboy Bebop. And just like in Cowboy Bebop it catches your attention easily. I'm sure it's been commented on plenty. \nThe ending however was disappointing. I've seen similarly endings in three other animes and the music is just not in tune with the general feel, idea, or the opening of the anime. That was disappointing. \nOther than those gripes I quite enjoyed Baccano! and it's splendidly atypical play with exposition. There is no end to the story, and there are no main characters, just one separate incident that ties worlds and lives of the characters together. Then, when it passes, it similarly unties them until, of course, the characters themself decide they want to interact with somebody in that way. \nI understand the perpetual hype about this anime now, but rather than being explosive this anime is just revelatory. One should watch this when they don't have anything to do and just want to be blow away by quality content. \n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Great. It's the immortal American mafia.\nJust what humanity needs.\nBaccano was a show that aired in Summer 2007, animated by Brains Base and directed by Takahiro Omori. 2007 was a wonderful year for anime. We got Ghost Hound, Nodame Cantabile, Sayounara Zetsoubu Sensei, Darker than Black and so much more. That was back when anime was in its prime, brimming with ideas and originality, and bringing a little something for everybody no matter what your favorite genre.\nOf course we also got Baccano. Usually light novel adaptions are something to be weary about but - cutting to the chase - Baccano pulled it off and ended up\n          \n        being an entertaining, wild, chaotic ride.\nI don't think I've ever watched a show as fun as this one. It's a bunch of chaos, comedy, horror and action where the timeline is all jumbled up, events and storylines are scattered about, and you're just having the time of your life as you watch a huge cast of colorful and quirky, likeable characters that you never even thought you would like often do downright despicable things.\nBaccano is actually an anime about quite a few different things, taking place in the 1930s of New York. To be quite short about it one storyline involves a train hijacking; another involves an elixir of 'immortality' and the people involved in it; then separately there's a mafia war that's going on, and a young girl who's just trying to find her older brother who mysteriously disappeared a year prior. And all the while the story isn't told in your usual 'linear' fashion, and jumps from one timeline to the next as all the stories and characters start to connect.\nIt's understandable if the description puts you off, mainly because it looks like it could be convoluted. This was my biggest fear going into Baccano; it's understandably trying to tell rather simple stories in a not so simple fashion. To be fair the first episode is disorientating. However persevere, and you'll find yourself with a wonderful anime series that really is an underrated gem.\nBaccano could have been convoluted; it could have been messy; it could have had characters you despise and don't care about - but it does exactly the opposite and thankfully does what it should right.\nStarting with the animation like most 2007 shows Baccano has high-budget consistent animation throughout the entire series. Brains Base is one of the smaller animation studios in the industry but they do not fail in delivering near flawless animation. The colors are quite dark and matching of a 1930s setting with hyper realistic backgrounds and the smoky, dreary atmosphere of life during the Great Depression. The effects, the brutality of the violence, it's all done incredibly stylishly. It's clear that the anime draws it's aesthetic and style from Western action flicks, Pulp Fiction to name one. Unfortunately the anime just gets way too dark in some scenes. And no...not 'dark' as in the tone gets dark. But the animation in general - some scenes are so dark you can barely see what's going on, which is a notable gripe of mine.\nAs for the sound Baccano's opening is common on lists of people's favorite opening themes. It's jazzy, unskippable, introduces the main characters and has you tapping your feet, much like Cowboy Bebop's opening jazz theme. This continues for a great chunk of the anime's OST, which boasts a wide range of mellow blues' tunes and snazzy jazz. It's also one of the few anime in which I wholeheartedly recommend the dub; there's a certain authenticity in the accents and the performances which meshes perfectly with the New York setting, and the actors all give it their all in playing and matching their parts. It's evident the dubbers had great fun in recording their lines, as there's not a dull delivery or underhanded performance in sight.\nBesides, whilst you won't do wrong with the sub,  you have some amazing voice actors on board for the dub, like J Michael Tatum as Isaac, Brina Palencia as Ennis, Maxey Whitehead as Czelaw and Bryan Massey who plays a fantastic Ladd Russo. \nMoving on, Baccano uses a rather unique style of narrative, as it isn't told in your usual linear storybook fashion and instead skips from one timeline to the next like a rabbit high on speed. This could easily be 'off-putting' as to be fair the story can be confusing - however that's what makes Baccano so fun. It never feels like it's overwhelming you with information; rather, once the first episode is out of the way, the anime settles into its own pace, weaving storylines and characters together as smoothly as it can, whilst also skipping from one timeline to the next. Certain flashbacks are jarring and can take away from the usually smooth flow of the plot, instead slowing the intense energy down and taking it back a notch or two. However execution wise I was surprised at how well the director managed to use the non-linear storyline to his advantage. \nIt's so much fun that you'll be re-watching it again and noticing things you wouldn't have noticed before, which is always a plus. The genres don't clash too much either - from the fluid action, the stirring horror, and the rampant comedy of things.\nAnd then we have the characters who are some of the most despicable yet the most likeable and colorful group of people I've ever seen. Makes sense? Well it should because that's what it is. There are so many characters and most people you'll speak to will say the same thing - they're all so oddly likeable. You have the cheery group of would-be thieves, Isaac and Miria, who when they're not robbing the oddest of items (like the time they tried to steal a museum) are spreading joy to the people around them; the psychopathic Ladd Russo who has a fascination with being the only one to kill his fiance Lua (who's quite an oddball herself), and Niece and...wait...Jaccuzi...Splot?\no-o\nThat's his real name too. Jaccuzi Splot, almost as ridiculous as the train's name of 'Flying Pussyfoot.' (Yeah, seriously legit.) That must be what Japan thinks of American names. I wouldn't be surprised if they just opened an English dictionary and plucked a few words out from it. There are plenty more too, from immortals to mafia members to train hijackers and sadistic torturers. And all of them, I kid you not, they are all so likeable that it feels wrong to say it. Why? Because as I said before Baccano is a lot of rampant fun. In fact the only innocent character in the entire series would be Eve, the young christian rich girl looking for her older brother Dallas. \nAre the characters deep? Hell no; this is Baccano. It's not trying to convey a philosophical story with complex, brooding characters. What it sets out to create however excels in most parts, and its kooky cast is certainly the strongest point of the anime.\nI believe one thing that does need addressing is the violence in Baccano. For something rather goofy, serious and comedic all at the same time the show is shockingly brutal, and doesn't shy away from detailed gore. The anime is never gratuitous however and all the blood and gore is used to advance the story - something  quite rare to see. In the first episode alone you see someone get their head blown off, a guy have his fingers sliced, a man unconscious from multiple punches, the aftermath of a torture and another man with his whole arm stripped bare and nothing but bone showing. Stylistic and exaggerated? Yes, but vividly detailed. Baccano without gore would be like echii without boobs. It's essential for the actual plot of things. \nIt is one of the tamer R16 series I've seen over here but the rating is on Baccano for a reason, so if you're squeamish you may want to give the show a pass.\nWith all my praise said and done I will say Baccano isn't a flawless show. The narrative style - while unique and well-done - isn't entirely original, as it has been done in movies and anime before, like - per say - the Garden of Sinners. The animation can get way too dark at times, and the characters aren't necessarily deep or anything. But either way 'fun' and 'loud' is the only way to describe it. Highly enjoyable and highly re-watchable, with colorful characters, surprisingly brutal violence and goofy comedy, exciting action and chilling horror all mixed into one. It isn't perfection but it is one of the most entertaining shows I've ever watched and one of my all-time favorites.\nI give Baccano a\n9.60/10\nHighly Recommended\nGood;; It's highly entertaining; the blood and gore is used effectively; the characters are quirky and colorful; fluid, consistent animation; the show is well-executed; an excellent dub; overall it's as fun as you'll get, and cleverly written to boot\nMixed;; Despite my high praise don't go into this show expecting something deep, profound and of class; the violence is there and yes, it is extremely gory, so not for the squeamish\nBad;; The animation is way too dark at times; the OVAs that follow the series up aren't a continuation but rather an expansion to the series, which is disappointing\n        "},

When you first start this show, these three stories are shown to the viewer out of order and with no true protagonist. These stories may seem unconnected at first ,but as you progress through the series, the stories and what happens within them begin to make more and more sense.\nSome friends of mine have dropped Baccano either because they thought the first episode was slow paced or because they didn't get the story, but when\n          \n        you watch it to the end, it becomes am action filled wild ride with a great story.\nForgive me again. I didn't really find anything spectacular about the art style. The animation was good, but just the art didn't leave a big impression on my mind, but that's likely because I prefer more  shows that do more with color. Within the context of the show, however, bright colors definitely wouldn't fit.\nThe opening theme is great! It gives us the names of most of the characters in our HUGE cast and is very fun to listen to. I wasn't really impressed with the ending theme however.\nThis show does a wonderful job with managing all its characters. In fact, it does a better job in 13 episodes (not counting the OVAs) and an out of order storyline than most series with the same amount. Nobody's really the main character and morality isn't black and white when it comes to them. The characters you might consider \"good\" are more of shades of grey and when it comes to the villains, though they are evil, evil is not their only characteristic.\nI give my enjoyment a 10. In all honesty, it's rare for me to finish a whole series within a week, even if it's only 12 to 13 episodes. Baccano was one of the rare instances where I finished an anime in less than two days. I stayed up late at night watching this show, eager to see what happened next in the three intertwined stories, eager to have my questions answered. If you dropped this anime without getting far into it because none of your questions were being answered or you had no idea what was going on, watch it till the end. When I did and it all made sense, it felt so good.\n"},

The artwork is great and the sound that goes with it fit perfectly for the time period it is set in.

And what made it even more confusing is the simple fact that two stories at different times of the same characters are being told.

Only thing preventing it from a 10 score is the average art, but Baccano! relies on it's vastly entertaining story to bring the viewer back episode after episode, not breathtaking frames of animation.

		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    I’ve been having this one recommended to me for years. Baccano! is a widely popular series that I just never got around (we all have those, and always will). I probably put it off because most people who recommended it to me were never able to explain what it was about. It’s hard to decide whether you’re in the mood for something when you don’t even know what it is. I eventually came across a description that made it sound right up my alley, so I finally took that plunge. If you ask me, a description is actually pretty easy. An immortality elixir has been\n          \n        discovered, and the secrecy and demand surrounding it sets into motion a series of hijinks that impact a cast of characters (mostly mobsters) in the 1930s.\nTo begin with, Baccano! has received a lot of comparisons to the films of Quentin Tarantino for several (superficial reasons). This had made it convenient to recommend for fans of the famous director, and it’s convenient for my review because I am a fan of Tarantino and have a direct frame of reference for how off-base and exaggerated the comparisons are. And why one’s one of the most acclaimed working directors and why the other is a series only known to members of a niche interest.\nBaccano! has been noted for being anachronistic like many Tarantino movies, yet they have vastly different approaches. Tarantino uses anachronism to cross reference pop culture and inject modern social commentary and perspective into old clichés. One such example is Inglourious Basterds, a World War II era movie that fictionalizes America’s involvement, notable for the common opinion that America’s intervention in the war wasn’t as severe as it should’ve been. Tarantino humorously mocks the patriotic nationalism surrounding the story of America’s involvement by including a team of wild super soldiers that retroactively enact violent justice on the Nazis. It’s a form of historic revisionism, wish fulfillment that allows Americans a more satisfying revenge against one of the most despised groups in human history. All of this angle is confirmed by the movie’s central plot element and rebellious coup de grace being that of a war propaganda film made for the Nazis. In Django Unchained, Samuel L. Jackson plays a wiseass slave who’s often humorously cynical of much of his life being in the hands of white men. Again, the injection of this more modern street attitude meets the classic slave story into a tale not just about gaining freedom, but about getting revenge against now increasingly archaic ideas of race superiority that have, in more modern times, been faced by much of black culture with increasing confidence and indignation. Similar to the revenge against the Nazis, this modern language and perspective over written history makes for a satisfying indulgence for many modern progressives, given the story more relevant weight and all of the action more punch. Beyond that, this anachronistic direction complete with newer dialect, the regrets of the past, and direction that visually winks at the audience and throws in retrospective pop hits from around the ages made Tarantino a director that has continuously excited an audience that’s formed much of the 21st century.\nBaccano!, on the other hand, makes no statements with its anachronisms. That’s because it has no general ideology with its approach. Tarantino’s anachronism forms an identity because those elements are consistently used through the course of the entire movie and used in conjunction with the rest of its themes. Baccano! doesn’t form a theme or a message because its construction changes constantly. The majority of the series attempts to play its setting legitimately, and yet at random instances will upend it with a nonsense portrayal of its setting. The anachronisms are spread thinly enough that when they invade it’s extremely jarring. At other times they’re small or big enough to remove the legitimacy of its setting. To put it another way, Baccano! fails both as a period piece and trying a unique take on one. To begin with, the prohibition era America setting is used to almost no unique effect. The political elements of the time, both governmental and underground, regarding the ban on alcohol are essentially not used. A speakeasy is mentioned once or twice, only notably as one gang’s is said to have been shot up by another, causing bad blood. The fact that it was a speakeasy turns out to be irrelevant because the business of the speakeasy or how it’s possibly interrupted is never talked about. All of Baccano!’s plot could’ve taken place in the modern era without having to change anything other than the aesthetic. Competing gangs exist to the modern day, and their grudges and alliances between each other aren’t beholden to anything having to do with prohibition.\nSomeone would make the point that this doesn’t matter, and that a strong aesthetic is worth pursuing alone as simple framework for the story. I completely agree, but this falls apart as well because Baccano!’s tone is so inconsistent. At times the cast will speak with a dialect appropriate for the time and proper accents, and at other times certain characters will lack accents entirely or put on a very artificial one (Todd Haberkorn). This show has often been praised for dialogue, and while most of it is totally fine I wasn’t expecting a series praised for this element to frequently dip into actual bad dialogue. I wish I took some more notes, but I can think of a few examples. One is during the Advenna Avis, a boat sailing during 1711. Many of the passengers are in a room together at night lit in candlelight. The atmosphere is heavy because one of the passengers is currently absent and planning to summon the devil using alchemy. Naturally, many are apprehensive. Still, only a few lines of dialogue are shared between a small number of people in the corner of the room so the atmosphere isn’t too thick or oppressive. Then, a completely random character jumps up from the center of the room and shouts “Smile! Smile, everyone!” like a little girl character in a shonen anime. Not only is a complete overreaction to the heaviness of the room’s atmosphere, but the childish phrasing is laughable and only magnified by the older setting. A much more believable way of handling this would’ve been to have one of the men, many of whom could be burly since they’re sailors, and have them offer to pass around a drink to lighten the mood. Instead of something to that effect, we get someone who sounds mentally handicapped. Another example is when a room of gangsters is shot up. Only one is still alive, and he’s limping to the phone. In one of my biggest writing annoyances, even though the man’s completely on his own in the room he feels the need to talk to himself and say “I have… to reach the phone… to tell my boss… what happened…”. This man who should be in shock or conserving energy if he isn’t feels the need to tell the audience that the reason he’s walking towards the phone while in danger is so that he can use the phone. You should be able to tell all of this by common sense and just watching, but Baccano! will lay on everything thick when it can. Lastly, my favorite example that I can remember, is when a character condescends to another by saying “you can think of me as the walking air”. The other character responds with “if you’re the air, then why don’t you quit talking!?”. It’s brilliant stuff.\nTwo characters in particular have no business being in this environment at all, and sadly they’re the most featured ones. The Bonny and Clyde duo of Isaac and Miria will appear every episode to destroy the sense of an engrossing period piece that could have any hope of taking you back to its time. These two comic relief characters possess a completely unrealistic idiocy that could’ve been fine in a story that particularly aimed for humor, but as a minor element they only conflict with the more focused thriller/drama writing style of the show. They’re almost like a virus, injecting themselves into a scene that’s trying to sell serious character drama and then doing their repetitive shtick of misunderstanding a situation, responding with a variety of non-sequiturs, and then having Miria play the role of an airhead blonde who repeats everything Isaac says in an ear-piercingly high pitch. Further intervening with the aesthetic, the two morons often carry out their crimes while wearing things such as native American headdresses and samurai armor. This comes across as irritatingly stupid in a world where most characters are normal human beings (albeit in exaggerated stereotypes), and in a non-comedy series you’re left thinking how these characters even manage to breathe. Not to mention they clash both visually and in dialogue with the rest of the setting’s attempts at accuracy. They are some of the worst characters I’ve seen in an anime, being that type that cheapens the attempts of everyone and everything else in the show. They’re “random humor” characters which is known for being a bottom barrel style of humor for how difficult it is to properly pull off, and their application here highlights why that’s the case. It’s easy enough to understand their role in the plot as a force of chaos that inadvertently set many events into motion, but it should be obvious that that’s entirely possible without writing them as a pair of contrived, impossible nitwits.\nThe series has also been compared to Tarantino for its excessive, nihilistic violence. This shouldn’t be much of a sell on its own. Horror movie gorefests are typically recommended for their impressive makeup and other special effects, and the creative ways with which they frame and portray kills. There’s an artistry to portraying even something as primal as violence and blood. Unless you’re insane, blood alone isn’t enough to get you excited. You know blood becomes more significant based on how its shed. You might have your favorite action movies based around how well it handles the physical action and if draws more of a response out of you if you can feel the characters’ pain and fear. Someone can’t just throw blood and guts on the screen and be said to have done it well, but that’s exactly what Baccano! tries to get away with doing. It’s rare to find a Tarantino movie without violent, psychopathic characters in it and Baccano! has plenty of its own. The difference between them comes in how they make these characters and their actions interesting and memorable. In a Tarantino movie, one scene has a psychopath having tied up an innocent man to a chair. Tension mounts as the killer mocks the victim by playing pop music and dancing while threatening to hurt him but holding off of doing so. What could be tonally inconsistent instead is allowed to be both blackly comic and disturbing, due to the proper attention given to both the strong presence of the killer and the victim. The victim’s fear is as emphasized as the killer’s childish glee, so although you can laugh at the killer’s eccentric mannerisms you also begin to feel unnerved as you continue to identify with the terrified face of the sniveling victim. That empathy begins to make you feel like you could be in that chair, in that deadly spot, which lends weight to the killer’s following actions. Where he could’ve just then blown the victim’s head off, he instead cuts off his ear and continues to mock him by talking into the detached ear and laughing. We grow increasingly uncomfortable upon realizing the victim is going to actually be tortured, and yet we still have attempts to disarm our view of the situation with an unexpected joke. This is a practically ideal set up for ultraviolence in every way. The pain delivered becomes something significant that can be felt by the viewer in some way, and it’s carried out in a creative method that will make that pain resonate in the mind beyond the point where it’s delivered. Baccano! on the other hand has its violence peak when a character simply repeatedly beats the face of a complete nobody into a pulp. Not only is this boring to watch because it’s a series of ordinary straights and hooks and thus ordinary violence we’re accustomed to, but the pain feels insignificant to us because the victim is. If the victim is a nobody then he’s essentially an object. A sandbag that happens to bleed. And nobody thinks about a busted sandbag after it’s thrown away, especially when the sandbag is broken for the only reason it’s meant for. A sandbag is hit, it breaks eventually, and then there’s nothing else to it, nor these characters and their actions. Baccano!’s violence is not only surprisingly spread thin over the 13 episodes, it’s also boring to watch and be involved in. It’s just blood.\nThe narrative style is worth talking about, as Baccano! tells its story in a non-linear fashion. The episodes jump through multiple time periods. This style amounts to nothing more than a gimmick. It’s also a very poorly-advised one, as the light novels Baccano! is adapted from tells its story in a linear manner. This means that the pacing at which information is given in the series changes completely for no reason and thwarts what the original story was meant to make the audience feel at specific times. One possible benefit to this style could be that the show could quickly transition between different time periods to drive home the themes of cause and effect, how seemingly minor incidents lead to major ones at different points or encounters had more meaning behind them than it seems at the moment. However, the transitions between time periods in Baccano! are lazily considered and typically don’t complement each other in any way, a scene usually lacking direct relation to the one proceeding it and information about scenes being unclear and distant from when they happen. This jumbled chronology is also a poor format given Baccano!’s style of writing. It is essentially a thriller, a genre that aims to subvert the expectations of the audience and surprise them. Baccano! becomes a series that reveals all of its greatest punches and their outcomes before they happen, removing anticipation and shock from a series that so obviously wants nothing more than to shock. This narrative style obfuscates a simple cause and effect story with easy to understand characters with brief backgrounds to imply a complexity that just isn’t there by using confusing narration. It’s a shallow intent, and what is at its heart a simple story that should succeed based on the guided impact of base appeals at emotion like most dedicated action/thriller works ends up weakening itself by posturing as a complex drama with ambiguity. Everything actually falls into place by the end, but you get an assumptive picture of the puzzle before it’s complete, and the significance of each piece isn’t known until you’ve already used it. In one scene a character remarks that he’s worried about using his real name in an earlier conversation. Why this matters is only found out episodes later, so in the moment this becomes a completely pointless scene that tells us nothing. We’re not even sure if there’s an actual question or mystery to be posed by not knowing why he’s panicking, and at this point it’s far easier to incorrectly infer that the kid was just a moron who spoke his real name in a dangerous situation for no reason. This pointlessly sours the perception of the scene. Other than the countless moments like these, the plot constantly loses momentum by switching time periods whenever a situation is escalating. It feels like the show never actually delivers on its thrills through this constant blue-balling of the audience. Building tension is one thing, but pacing is another. Baccano! constantly feels like it’s trading builds for builds, and in this way nothing feels like a payoff even when it hits.\nBaccano!’s production values are also lacking. It’s a completely average early 2000s series, which means it was made when digital production was really starting to catch on. The cheaper cost of digital is used to full advantage here, all to the series’ visual detriment. The whole thing lacks character in its art style, with the cast and backgrounds looking like many digital shows that came out at the time and still do today. The shading is particularly terrible, and if you have a distaste for poorly done digitally drawn shows you’ve probably noticed what I mean. Shading is emphasized by drawing dark grey geometric shapes over characters and objects that look like someone used a shape-drawing tool in Microsoft Paint so it doesn’t look like light is actually bending around anything. Because of this method of shading that doesn’t gradually change the light on an object like how things look in reality, every color in the show is a flat, consistently solid color other than the parts with gray shading. So this looks like someone used the color fill tool in Microsoft Paint. The production team had a difficult time keeping the character designs consistent, and from scene to scene the quality and style of the faces can vary incredibly which is sloppy and jarring. The backgrounds are done in the same way they’ve been done for over a decade now. They’re all blanketed with a blur effect because using focus in visual direction is too much work, and as a result these 3D render-looking fuzzy backgrounds clash with the stark simplicity of the things in the foreground that are actually animated. As for the animation quality, it’s not particularly bad but not at any commendable level either. Frames noticeably skip at complete random, and it’s obvious the team tries to avoid movement as much as possible. When a character is talking, usually only their mouth moves and nothing else in the room moves in response to what they say. It’s that kind of corner-cutting you’ve seen before that makes the same story feel duller than it has to.\nThe music is all right. That’s really the highest praise I can give it. The best thing is that this part actually suits the aesthetic. The soundtrack is full of jazz that isn’t too far outside of its era to be unbelievable, and it’s at least the dominant genre of its setting. Other than that, the compositions themselves are very forgettable. It becomes an appropriate but typical anime soundtrack. Baccano!’s opening has been particularly praised, and to give credit where credit is due, it is a good one. Namely with how the scenes cleverly transition from character to character, and the name cards are a genuinely useful way to help the viewer keep track of who’s who in the large cast. I’m less enthusiastic about the song, which begins as some bustling mischievous jazz but then suddenly transitions around the midway point into sounding like the theme song to a late 60s American sitcom. The ending theme is baffling, a dully dramatic and slow female-sung ballad that doesn’t complement even the most serious moments of the series with next to no animation or dynamic art direction.\nI don’t hate Baccano!. In fact, I almost don’t even dislike it. I just felt next to nothing while watching it, and I’m amazed to say that about such a popular series. There’ve been several things I don’t feel as strongly about as most people do (as well as the inverse), but for the most part I can see the qualities of those things even if I think others exaggerated them. When it comes to Baccano! I’m nothing short of puzzled by how much it’s caught on. I can’t really imagine what drew so many people to the series other than the most superficial elements. The Tarantino comparisons, even though anyone who’s seen Tarantino should realize the difference in execution and quality. The American-set period piece, even though it’s anachronistic and doesn’t completely tap into the appeal and aesthetic of the era. The violence, even though it’s very unimaginatively carried out and lacking impact. The immortality story, even though very few characters have their motivations impacted by the fact that they are now immortal which takes that hypothetical drama out of the equation, and the fact that a what-if immortality story is undermined when everyone in your show has superhuman strength regardless. A thriller that doesn’t thrill because its format disrupts all set up. An ensemble cast where many of the characters in the opening do almost nothing and have no complex characterization to make the plot worth watching for the sake of itself. Baccano! is the kind of series I would normally recommend to no one because I don’t think it does anything very well, but for whatever reason its popularity has persisted in spite of that.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    After watching Durarara!!,  wanted to get in to the Light Novels. I've only read a few so far, but I'm already in love with Narita's work. So of course, I had to get in to Baccano!, starting off with the anime.\nStory: Even though leaving a botched plot at the beginning to draw it all together at the end isn't exactly new, the way that Baccano! did it was spectacular. I'm not going to talk about it too much, because I'm spoiler-free, but at the end, there's quite a few things that are open for interpretation. You know the facts, and how it ends, but\n          \n        how it came to be isn't exactly spelled out for you. So \"open for interpretation\" not \"unanswered.\"\nThere were lots of twists and turns that were unexpected, and putting the pieces together was very fun as the viewer. Even if everything else was crap, I would still love this anime for the story alone.\nAnimation: The detail in the background and settings was there when it needed to be. I don't remember finding anything I didn't like with the art. Something I particularly liked was the attention to the anatomical diversity. Most of the gang members you saw had a different facial structure or body type, the main characters all looked completely different. Old members looked old, the young looked young. I think that the male outfits could've varied some, and the details for the time period could've been more prevalent. However, those aren't really important and deal-breaking details.\nSound: Baccano! has a jazzy soundtrack that could get you pumped for an action scene, or mellow you out during a dramatic scene. The sound effects weren't anything special, but they fit and weren't bad. The music went with the time period as well, which makes it even better.\nCharacters: As the opening plays, a lot of characters are named off and shown. There are 4 mafia families, and that seems to get confusing. However, you quickly weed out who is more important than others, and the anime sort of groups the characters according to the roles they play, so it makes it easier to differentiate. The anime has an effective use of stock characters and the changes in the dynamic characters were touching. All of the characters were different, and had characteristics to either love or hate. They made up a lot of the entertainment.\nOverall, I highly recommend Baccano! especially if you liked Durarara!! {and vice-versa}. I can guarantee that you will have a favorite character. It's definitely worth the watch, and for 13 episodes, what the hell? Why not?\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Baccano! is an anime I thoroughly enjoyed. I watched only because I loved Durarara!! and well, if it's by the same author, it's bound to be good, right? I actually stopped after 3 episodes because it was confusing. Ironic since I loved Durarara!! so much.\nPlot: 10/10\nThe gist of it is, 3 story lines are all tied together. It's about trains, immortality, and the mafia. It's hard to follow at first because Baccano! changes point of view so much, but after a while, the pieces come together. There's a great sense of realization you feel near the end. It's that feeling, I think, is what makes\n          \n        Baccano! so great. It's a unique storytelling I enjoy a lot.\nArt: 9/10\nI'm very fond of the art and animation. There were nice action scenes. \nCharacters: 9/10\nThe characters were great. There are so many of them, so there isn't any time for character development. But, I really liked all of them. Each of them had their own weird vibe.\nMusic: 10/10\nI like jazz. The soundtrack is jazzy. Good, good.\nAfter watching, my conclusion is that Baccano! is definitely better than Durarara!! but I love both. I recommend to anyone who needs something to watch.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    This review is a reflection of my own personal ideas and opinions; which means that there may be things in my review that may contradict your own opinions. So please, being such that this review is for your enjoyment, please keep any rude or abrasive \"stuff\" to yourself.\nOtherwise, I hope you all have a good day, and that you will enjoy my review :))))))).\nBaccano!.... Overall, it was a very enjoyable anime, with my enjoyment being 9/10. Because I don't have much to say beforehand, I will start with the more detailed review regarding each aspect of the anime.\nPlot: 9/10 \nThe plot for the anime is\n          \n        probably the highest factor overall, and I would have given it a 10/10 except for the fact that I never give 10/10 to any animes (even if it does indeed deserve it). Now, the plot is not a single linear storyline, in fact; the plot has three stories that focus upon: the mafia, the situation aboard the train, and the immortals. The best thing about the plot, is probably that even though the three main stories are quite diverse, they manage to connect them all in ways I cannot say, due to spoilers. The plot manages to shift through time and different stories in a way that makes it all the more interesting, as while it does that, viewers are able to connect each story to each other piece by piece; and being such that the story is extremely fast paced, it is more enjoyable to the viewers. As the show progresses, you will learn more and more about the characters and the plot itself, making you think during the process. \nCharacters: 8/10\nThe next best thing about the anime, is the character design. Although the anime dosn't have a main character, the characters still never fail to impress, each character is very unique and has their own background and story. While the show progresses, new things will be revealed about the characters. The characters can range from being funny, to being a psychotic killer, and that is mainly one of the aspects to why this anime is amazing. The characters are also connected to each other, just as the plot is. finally, the most enjoyable part of the characters is that they all have an important role to play, and the choices and actions they make can create a large effect upon the plot of the story.\nCinematography: 7/10\nThe cinematography was pretty good, although it could have been better. Buuuut... then again it was made during 2007... Anyways, regarding the animations and art, I think it was OK, as it very smooth and the art had a very 1930's feel to it. The animations got through and duing action scenes, it managed to feel very \"refreshing\". Now, the main part of the cinematography in the anime was the sound. The sound had a very 1930's feel to it, and managed to give appropriate sounds during appropriate moments; ranging from sad to ecstatic type of music.\nOverall, my enjoyment of the anime was quite well and my final \"grade\" for it is a 9/10. This anime was an instant classic and it deserves to be watched by many.\n I hope you enjoyed my review, thanks for your time! :)\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Story:\nThe most important part of an anime is the story, at least for me, and when it came to this Baccano certainly fulfilled its share of the bargain. Its story is fairly original and when it comes to the execution of it I haven't seen anything done quite like this had. Some viewers may find themselves muddled up with the constant switching of time periods as it does change from 1930 to 1931 regularly in each episode and in a couple episodes a bit earlier than so if you take you eyes off of it then you may have no clue when you are or\n          \n        who you are following. But this didn't matter for me as I was glued every step of the way. Every new scene made me laugh or made or gave me goosebumps especially the violent scenes which I may watch 5 times before moving on. As for the story itself  I can't really go into detail as it would contain major spoilers plus you've got the synopsis so you should know the basics but just let me say this if you are a fan of violence and can keep up you will love the show. For me however, what made this show great is the characters.\nCharacters:\nThis is where the focal point of the anime is. When it comes to characters Baccano has an abundance of them and it switches between them as the main characters so you get to see a bit more about them each time they come into the picture. A few of the main characters in this are also the considered to be the bad guys and all the characters have a morally ambiguous side to them which unlike many anime the show doesn't treat this as a bad thing in fact quite the opposite it loves the bad sides of these characters and, with the exception of a few, they seem to develop that bad side which is a very refreshing for the altruistic views of many anime. In the end I found myself loving every character again with a few exceptions. I would issue a word of warning though the show has some characters whose purpose seem to be just give you a laugh in between serious parts. Even if you don't like these kind of characters I urge you to watch anyway just be aware of that.\nArt, Sound: \nI'm not too good at putting into words how I feel about this kind of stuff but I'll give it a shot. The soundtrack for the show suites the setting a lot with jazz or swing music not sure of the specific genre but lets just say it does sound like it came out of 1930's America. I specifically like how they use this music in some of the more violent scenes which I thought would ruin the mood but instead gave me a huge super villain style grin on my face as someone had a round of Tommy gun bullets shot into their stomach, which may be a bit worrying for me. But basically it really suited the scenes and didn't feel out of place. Art wise it looked really beautiful especially in the gruesome moments. The style has a fairly serious feel to it and the characters looked incredible and very distinguishing from each other without having to go to the lengths of over the top deformities.\nOverall, Enjoyment:\nTo summaries I absolutely loved the show it's and original idea done originally with a cast of great characters and has an abundance of well done and gruesome action scenes. I would urge anyone who like these things to watch this and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Baccano is set in the 1930s U.S, with small stories following different characters and you get to see their history and ambitions. Baccano uses a supernatural, horror, drama, comedy and action mixture and together with that the stories are short and jumps to a different events, usually in the eyes of a different character, creates a unique anime with a fantastic story.\nBe warned, kids and people who can't handle blood and gore should definitely not watch this.\nAt first, I found it hard to digest the feeling of short stories being told twice or even trice by different views. But even though it consists of small\n          \n        stories, they're all connected and thus resulting in a detailed comprehensive plot. So you won't have a feeling of characters with their own distinct short stories in small bits with no overall plot development whatsoever (which I first had suspected).\nThe characters are amazingly easy to like, whether they be extremely dumb or murderers. My only wish would have been more episodes to follow the development of the characters, which in my eyes ended a little bit abruptly. Additionally, the development during the story is slightly cramped due to the short stories which seemed to be valuing the plot more than the characters, but that might just be my personal opinion.\nThe animation is great, with the colours of the post-war clothing, the way the characters are drawn and much more results in a realistic feeling. \nThe music isn't as great as I'd like to be, but there's nothing wrong with it expect the averageness. But the sound is good, the voice actors are top-notch with no complaints, and small things (like the train) further increasing the realistic feeling. \n\nStory – 9\nAnimation – 10\nSound – 7 \nCharacters – 8\nEnjoyment - 9\nOverall – 9\n\nLastly, this is my first review and I hope you liked reading it as much as I did writing it!\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    During the year 2011 while I was waiting for the new episodes of Ao no Exorcist to air, I was watching Durarara, an anime that many will be familiar with after hearing outcries and squeals about Shizuo and Izaya in a romantic relationship with each other despite the two completely hating one another. The anime was good with a narrative that was not linear, some interesting mysteries and some very likable characters all with different motivations. However it failed to deliver in its second half where the narrative became more linear, the craziness that made the first half so memorable was replaced with a more\n          \n        serious tone, there was more angst and not to mention it completely cast aside its compelling supporting cast in favor of focusing more on the high school kids. Still a good anime, but could have been better.\nNow you may be wondering what this has got to do with my review of Baccano. Well Durarara was created by Ryohgo Narita, the same man behind Baccano. Both shows were also produced by the same studio Brains Base and directed by Takahiro Omori. When I heard about this I was interested to seeing how Baccano was like and 2 years later I began to finally watch this show. \nAnd it was well worth the experience.\nStory (9)\nThe premise of Baccano can be pretty simple to understand. However it follows many different narratives in a disjointed order that it can be pretty confusing to some viewers. All I can say is that it is set in 1930s America where a violent feud has opened up between two gang members, a group of immortals are trying to find some bottles that were stolen from their reach, a mass murderer is on board a train, 2 Bonnie and Clyde type characters set off to buy a gift for one of their friends and a girl is searching of her older brother. Not to mention much of the first episode is actually the ending of the series. But like the works of Quentin Tarantino, it all comes together by the end of the series to the point where this non-linear narrative can pretty much be forgiven. The best thing about Baccano that Durarara did not have, is that the former stays in this format for the duration of the series and keeps a consistent tone throughout. The show ends on a sequel hook, but don’t worry. The OVAs (which I am still in the process of watching) add more to the story and could possibly even conclude all its loose ends.\nCharacters (10)\nThere are many different types of characters in Baccano just like in its spiritual successor Durarara. You’ve got a comedic, eccentric but extremely likable couple, a serial killer, a psychopathic mafia member with a lust for blood, a character that almost fools you into believing he is the main protagonist when he is not, a religious saint-like girl, a pussy who is apparently one of the most wanted man in the country, an immortal alchemist with a greed for knowledge, an emotionless girl, a manipulative kid etc. There are so many different types that are well written, you must like at least one of them after you’re done with the series. But the best part is that these characters are given equal amounts of screentime. No side character feels pushed away from the story, each important one is fleshed out and given a lot of depth to them. We get to know their past, their relationships with other characters and an insight of what they like to do best.\nAnimation (8)\nOkay I’ll admit that the animation is not really that good at points. It’s decent but is lacking compared to other 2007 works such as Darker than Black, Gundam 00 and Gurren Lagann. However this is not a huge issue for the studio that produced this was Brains Base and this was pretty much their first major anime. And for a first time studio, the animation is pretty darn good. The character designs look original and unique, the background is hugely representative of the 1930s era of USA and shows it, the fight scenes are kind of fluid for the most part… It’s impressive that a first time studio is able to create such good quality scenes that I have to give them credit. \nSound (10)\nI saw this show in the English dub after hearing so many people claiming that it is one of the best out there. And they were right. Every character is given an accent that fits their nationality and the manner in which they were raised. In fact I’d recommend the dub to pretty much anyone. The original Japanese language is as with almost all good anime, really well acted. The music is also a plus with an ominous tune used for some of the dark scenes involving the alchemists and an amazing jazz soundtrack used for some of the fight scenes. \nIn conclusion Baccano is an amazing show that I’d like to recommend to pretty much anyone who likes a good break from all the slice of life, moe shows out there. It’s brutal, it’s bloody, it’s exhilarating, it’s insane and it is just plain awesome. Its got a few flaws in its disjointed narrative but that could be forgiven by the end of the series. It is miles ahead of Durarara also with even more likable characters and a narrative that stays almost consistent in tone throughout. If you loved the first half of Durarara, you’ll find this to be absolutely amazing. If you like gangster movies you’ll get a kick out of this. And if you like Pulp Fiction you would adore this anime.

It makes me feel like I'm missing out on something. This is why, when it all comes together in the end, it's just that much more cathartic.\nBaccano!! LOVES this method of presentation, and it delivers it extremely and consistently well throughout its run. It's confusing, but not the type of confusing that forces you to go back and think about it in order to proceed. It asks you to place your trust in it and continue on; that it'll be vindicated in the end, and it delivers.\nThe character designs are\n          \n        diverse and excellent, and the animation is as good as a series gets without a feature film budget for each episode. And really, the only way it could have done any better with regards to the art would require that very budget.\nThe music is catchy, fitting, and punctual. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's worth buying the soundtrack, but it fulfills its every duty to the series with high marks in all areas.\nI can almost guarantee that anyone watching this series will fall in love with at least one of the characters, if not all of them. EVERYONE has a great story for the series to tell and even side-characters end up relevant. This is a great feat for a sixteen episode series, especially when certain series' with take dozens of episodes to give everyone their due.\nBaccano!! is all around fantastic and it's tough to say anything it could have done better.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    This anime is really good when it comes to a story and characters. The animation might not be perfect but it gives the atmosphere needed for this anime. I liked it and if you're a fan of anime with a good yet hard to understand storyline, you will love this.\nBut before you watch it, I would suggest keeping a close eye on the years that appear during the anime because they are what makes up the story. \nThe whole anime is based on American mafia, gangs and thugs. You can say it's got the kind of Mafia feel to it. With Tommy Guns, clubs, gang\n          \n        wars etc. So, don't expect anything japanese here. It's all-round american mafia. But there are still good people and bad people in it.\nStory 9/10:\nI really can't explain it well since it's quite messed up. But here's a brief summary. The anime links the events occuring during these years; 1930,1931,1932 with a few scenes for some past years to give a better storyline. These are not in order and one episode may start at 1932 and then show 1930 and in the end show 1931. But, as you progress towards the end, the story fixes itself together and the whole picture can be seen at the end. So don't worry if you don't get it during the show. I left it in between quite a few times because I got confused but it's pretty clear in the end.\nI'll summarize the years here according to a main event:\n1930: Before departure of the Flying PussyFoot\n1931: During the travel of the Flying PussyFoot\n1932: After arrival of the Flying PussyFoot\nCharacters 8/10:\nThis show has a lot of main characters. Almost everyone plays an important role in the story. Each year shows the characters and what they were doing. Some characters are straight up comedy shows while others are psychotic killers. All the characters have something unique to them and it's pretty interesting.\nEnjoyment 8/10:\nThis anime is really enjoyable for people who like anime with a good, twisty story. Many will be turned away due to the confusing storyline or mediocre animation but it's  an anime worth watching.\nOverall, I liked it. It's a good watch. It's based a little of alchemy (the concept, not action like in FMAB). So, give it a try. It's a nice anime.\n        "},

C'mon, it's Very hard to do anything memorable with such little screen time. I threw it into my pilots to watch list just to make numbers, but that night I watched about half of the show. It's got a very large cast, something which usually puts me off, but each character has enough distinction from one another that they actually become noticeably different and memorable. That said, I can still only remember\n          \n        like seven or eight of their names, I'm not That good. I doubt I'll ever forget Ladd Russo or Vino, and neither will you.\nBaccano! starts off pretty simple, it's pseudo Brooklyn full of 30s gangsters trying to pull off a train heist. There's bebop jazz and shootouts with Chicago typewriters, internal gang feuds, and a gang war just brewing to break loose. Put all of this energy into a few train carriages, add in a gang of psychopaths who just want to have a good time, some bomb making street thugs hunting cargo, and a mysterious killer known as the Rail Tracer, and you've got the perfect storm. All of that in itself feels a bit like a Guy Richie film, think Snatch if you can't think of one, but what really sets this apart and makes it unique is the addition of a handful of Immortals scattered through the show, trying to hide the secrets of everlasting life from violent men. It's a bit like a secret war going on between old enemies hidden in plain sight, adding the strongest plotline in the show.\nAs you can guess, there is a Lot going on in this show. Individual storylines play out independently at the beginning, setting up the world and the main cast, until they all become the one big story on the train itself. You're gonna get invested in at least half of these characters, the noble ones and the downright evil ones alike. In fact it's hard not to love the villains for their charisma alone. The fight scenes can be vicious, and seeing the same story from different points of view really fleshes out everything you're going to want to know about. Don't think this is just one big murder train story, Baccano! can be very tongue in cheek (especially when immortality juice gets mistaken for booze and stolen by gangsters). The pace is quite fast, but all the loose ends of the story are neatly tied up leaving you feeling satisfied with the ending, if a little lost because it's over. The specials afterwards are a must watch, they really are the cherry on top. This had a great budget, wonderful animation, a downright incredible soundtrack that keeps the mood up, and a fantastic english dub that puts in so much effort to stay with the early American theme that it's actually very hard not to get drawn in. All in all, I'd say this is really is the best anime series of 2007 and definitely worth checking out. I liked it so much I showed it to half a dozen people then ended up buying the DVD that I heard about it from!\n        "},

However I feel it's not the best execution for all people.\n______________________________________________________________\nThe story is about, well a lot, but it begin with the after match of a accident on a train headed for New York in 1931. After, we get to know what happen on board the train, the famous \"Flying Pussy Foot\"; yes that's it's name; who it's happening to and why it's happening. While we get told the story of the train, we also get the back story to most of the main characters,\n          \n        set one year prior in 1930. There we get a mafia story viewed from all sides. These are the main time points but there are more of them, all small things who escalate to bigger things later on.\nBut the flaw with the story lie with it's story structure. The story takes place in four different points in time, 1930-1932 and 1711. With all these stories and their connection to each other it's telling the viewer, it can be hard to follow. They do explain why the story isn't linear, but if you're one who doesn't follow a story closely you may get lost.\n______________________________________________________________\nAll the characters for enjoyable and most imported fun to watch.\nI believe the two the steal the show and run around with it are \"Issac Dian\" and \"Maria Harvent\", the comical relief characters of the show. The are people who just enjoy every part of their live to it's fullest and almost never is in a bad mood. Whatever the situation, be it digger for gold in a abandon mine in their underwear, to watching a room filled with blood from floor to ceiling, they keep up their carefree nature. When ever they are on screen, they always make me laugh, even when the place they are filled with tension.\n______________________________________________________________\nThe animation is good and the characters are great designed, nothing to write home about. But the music is really good. As a fan of jazz and saxophone, this music it just right down my ally.\n______________________________________________________________\nOverall it's a great show with only a few points off.

Baccano! intertwines three different stories into one series with no real congruent beginning or ending, but as the puzzle pieces start to fall in place you're able to understand and appreciate where the story is headed and the different motivations and actions characters make make more and more sense.

There is a bit of a fantastical element to Baccano!, mainly the immortality storyline, and while being able to take a gunshot to the head and survive is an engaging concept, it really ruins the audience's suspension of disbelief, sucking the viewer out of this world due to the impossibility of the idea in an otherwise reasonably realistic world. Baccano! Is leagues above other anime in ambition and is able to deliver a lot of the time, but there are a couple minor problems in the show, that make me not view it as the masterpiece that it is often heralded as.

It's certainly unique among anime- the overlapping stories are nothing short of masterful. Knowing what happens at the end can sometimes ruin a story, but it actually manages to enhance the experience of Baccano! Even when you know who survives aboard the Flying Pussyfoot, for example, it somehow manages to be thrilling and suspenseful throughout the experience. \nWhat takes the interesting concept and well-executed story to the next level, however, are the characters. Even in\n          \n        the short thirteen episodes (plus the three specials afterwards), each character is fleshed out and feels real. Of course, some get more screen time, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they end up being left out. The surprise character reveal more than halfway through the show ends up being one of the most fascinating and engaging characters of the show.\nAnd, let's be real here, this show is worth watching for Isaac and Miria alone. These two should be at the top of any best duo list- for anime or really just in general. The two prevent the anime from ever taking itself too seriously or delving too far into its more gruesome side. I've never seen a pair of character before that can just make you smile as soon as they appear. I looked forward to their every moment and they never let me down.\nMy only complaints- the art was fine and worked well for the show, but it wasn't anything particularly special. I'm not sure if it was just my source, but anything happening on the outside of the train was extremely dark and difficult to see as well. \nThat opening though. That opening is a classic of anime.\nSo, I would say that Baccano! is certainly a must-watch. I went with the dub, which honestly feels more natural considering that most of the show is set in 1930s New York- the different accents made it all feel more authentic. I think Baccano! is a great anime to start with too: the dub is great, the subject matter is accessible, and it's got a nice balance of drama and humor. If you've got someone you want to introduce to anime, Baccano! is the way to go.\n        "},

It is a bit complex and confusing at times soo not recommended for everyone.\nSTORY:\nthe story of baccano! is unique and intriguing. Anyone who want to watch an anime with a great story then this is the one. At first i hesitated to watch this series as iam not really into the whole fantasy genre but as i started to watch the series i was amazed on how the story unfolded and the way it was presented which totally rocked. The though a story of immortals of the 1930s might sound a little strange,\n          \n        Baccano! had one of the most realistic mafia and gangster animes out there. The story was nearly perfect for an anime series and is very interesting and is a mix of almost every genre. During the first couple of eps it may be a bit confusing but everything will be sorted out and explained in the latter episodes. Also the ending was really fantastic.\nANIMATION:\nThe animation could have been a lot of better considering the length of series. Sometimes there was a lack in details of the characters and backgrounds. Other than tat animation was really fluid and action scenes were intense and fast paced. Almost each of the long list of characters in the anime had their own unique design and no two characters were alike. \nSOUND:\nBaccano had awesome soundtracks from the start to the end and was somewhat similar to cowboy bebop. The OP and ED was equally good. Music suited this anime perfectly.\nCHARACTER:\nAlmost every characters in baccano had their own unique behaviors and styles. Even though this anime had a lot of characters, no two characters were alike in design which i really liked. There were some annoying character and weird but most of the characters are lovable. Character development and the characters was overall very good and was very different form most the animes. \nENJOYMENT:\nVery enjoyable from start to finish and gets really exciting during the last few eps.. \n"},

The story is based around the events that unfold in the year 1932 on-board the flying pussyfoot, a Chicago to New York express train, underpinned by a back story related to a bunch of immortals, it also a lot more gory than I had anticipated, its definitely not for the faint hearted. \nI'll leave the story till the end, the artwork is very good, the artists have managed to settle on artwork which works with the setting\n          \n        of 1930's America, and while it may not be as polished as some Gonzo works, it benefits from this. The sound is good quality from the screams, and voice actresses to the periodic music that occurs in the background, it all comes together to give the feel of 1930's America.\nThe characters are probably the best part of Baccano! Miria and Isaac are the funniest double act and always brighten the screen whenever they are on, as well as having other great characters like Firo and Jaccuzi. There are also characters that should make you feel completely the opposite, but the characters are so well polished that you can't help but like all of them (apart from perhaps one, the main villain). While a lot of the back stories are covered in the series, the OVA's after give the perfect rounding off to all the characters and should be watched for the complete story.\nI found the story quite hard to follow. The story telling is through a reporter at the start but eventually moves along at its own pace, but has a reservoir dogs theme of jumping back and forth between times as well as character stories.This may have worked in the film which focused on one group and was one film, but with four/five main groups and in episodes as in Baccano! I don't think this works, In a normal anime I can get the story after 2/3 episodes but after 4 I was still wondering what was going on. There are too many different storylines going on at once for this style of script to work in my opinion, the train is a good way to bring everyone together, but I was also surprised that the groups didn't run into each other more often on the train, being only one way forward and back. Once you get to towards the end of the series though, the pieces finally come together and the true masterpiece of the story can be seen, I'm just afraid many people will have been put off by the confusing opening scenes.\nOverall this is a very good anime, the characters and overall storyline are fantastic but are let down by poor opening episodes and random story jumping.\n        "},

Film noir and pulp fiction . . . in an anime?! When I read this description, before it even aired, I knew it was a must see for me.\nHaving seen the movie Pulp Fiction, I knew, to some extent, what to expect in terms of how the story is told. If you aren't familiar with the film, then allow me to explain. This is the kind of anime that you can start watching without having any idea as to what it is about. The\n          \n        reason being you truly don't know what is going on until around the halfway point in the series.\nAll you need to know is that Baccano! is a violent, action packed, comical drama involving immortal alchemists and the mafia (I hear people saying . . . what?). There is no question that you will be confused for quite some time, but you should stick with it since everything does become clearer as the story progresses. As for the ending, I thought it was very well done and everything came together nicely.\nThe music they chose for Baccano! is superb. A collection of jazz tunes that immerses you in the time period of the anime. The opening song quickly became one of my all time favorites. You can see from the OP that there is a large number of characters. With every episode more and more is revealed about them through the use of multiple time jumps/flashbacks, and you can see in which way they are all connected. Each character has a unique personality and a story of their own. In the end, you will be wishing that you had more time to spend with them. They are truly unforgettable.\nBaccano! was one of the best, most entertaining anime of 2007. The only thing left for me to say is that I really wish it was more talked about.\n        "},

By the time the train reaches its destination, a fairly large amount of blood has been spilled on it.\nWithout giving too much away, I'll say that there is a bit of a flare for the supernatural in this work. Its not overbearingly so, but it works itself in in a way that it could potentially exist in our world because it remains hidden, which is a quality I quite like in supernatural media.\nThe story itself is very nicely done. It reminded me a bit of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya in\n          \n        that the story is told all over the place instead of in logical order, by means of several flashbacks. The actual events on the train itself go in order, and are quite interestingly developed.\nWhat really stood out for me were the characters in this series. From the loveable idiot thief pair of Issac and Miria, to the crybaby Jacuzzi and his love Nice, to the deadly Railtracer, all the characters have unique personalities that draw the viewer in. While some characters did get more attention than others, with a cast as large as Baccanos this tends to be expected.\nThe general style of the animation fit the theme, and I quite liked the feel it gave off. Its seemed just a bit more fluid than an average anime, especially in the opening theme. Having mentioned the opening theme, I would like to point out that the song Baccano opens to has to be one of my favorite anime theme songs.\nIn the end, this was really an enjoyable watch. However, if you aren't a fan of action or blood there are probably much better things for filling your time, but if you do enjoy them, you should definitely give this series a chance.\n        "},

One day, I decided to give this a try, and it turned out great.\nStory/Character: 9/10\nI decided to merge these two categories together because I believe that they are more connected in this anime than in any other. Of course, all plots are made up of the characters, but Baccano! is more than that. Baccano! has an extraordinary amount of characters, and it was difficult for me at the start to determine which ones were the main characters. To be honest, I\n          \n        was slightly confused by the time leaps between the episodes. But once I got the hang of it, I really got to understand more and more about how all the characters are connected and related to each other. I started seeing the big picture. That was what I found very entertaining about this anime: how ALL of the characters matter, and how strangers can meet and become good friends in a very short time. \nArt: 8/10\nQuite distinguishable. The characters in Baccano! all have unique appearances and/or expressions that help you remember who is who. This aspect of the anime was done very well to help the characters leave deeper impressions on the audience. Aside from the appearance of characters, the background scenes also contained a vibe that gave the audience either a positive or negative feeling depending on what is about to happen next. I personally liked the Pumpkinhead and Santa Claus. (See opening)\nSound: 9/10\n The jazz music in Baccano! was not only extremely sonorous but also very groovy. There isn't a lot of anime out there whose openings do not have lyrics, and Baccano! is quite unique in this respect. When I first listened to the opening, the catchy tone caught me by surprise and whenever it is played, I can't help tapping my fingers. Aside from the opening, the other OST pieces that are played are just earcandy. The set up of crazy rhythms often depict a situation that IS CRAZY. The appearance of a calm, country piece serves to juxtapose the darker sides of the anime.\nEnjoyment/Overall: 9/10\nI quite enjoyed this anime, once you get to a certain event in the anime, the cliffhangers really start hanging you.  Amazing in all aspects, this anime is an anime that should be watched by BOTH mystery and comedy fans. One thing that I did not really like about this anime was the time leaps between the episodes. Many anime have time leaps that show what ACTUALLY happened before the start or some sort of knowledge that they give the audience afterwards. However, this anime seemed to have too much time leaps that was not necessary. It kind of confused my sense of time as I watching it, and this was why I did not give this anime a 10. However, despite, this aspect of the anime, you should give this a try by all means, if you like comedy and/or mystery genres. \n        "},

In 1711, a group of alchemist what seems to be on board the ship called the \"Advenna Avis\". They are on this ship to seek out the secret of immortality by conjuring a demon which will grant them their wish.\n2. In 1930, a younger sister is on the search for her brother during the great depression (which took place on 1929) NYC. As she searches for her brother she does not realize how much of a mess her brother is in.\n3. In 1931,\n          \n        there is a transcontinental train called \"The Flying Pussyfoot\" departs for the very last time. The poor passengers not knowing what horrors await them on the train, soon to realize that they would be dead. However the event was hidden from the public and was covered up by the authorities.\nReview.\nI'll be honest when I first watched Baccano! it was truly a disorientating experience. Forget your usual chronological story telling, instead Baccano!, for half an episode, contemplates how to tell its story via a sequence of a conversation between a newspaper vice-president and his secretary. They finally decide to tell it by scrambling this stupendous tale that already from the start has a huge scope has so much content to cover and characters included by jumping around between several seemingly unrelated storylines. Even still does not settle down until several episodes after that! AND EVEN THEN. I was clueless as to what was going on. Some people have said that it's disrespectful of the audience to do this, it's like dropping a person off a plane without a chute. But that's an odd criticism, since that is implying that it is respectful to simply tell a story like anyone else would, using the simple techniques we learnt during out 6th grade English classes. Is that not just milquetoast? It is truly odd when you level that criticism into anime, where anything that resembles 'normal' is often routed, twisted and bungled for the sake of being as cool and awesome as possible.\nLike the anime \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\", \"Baccano!\" deliberately throws out the conventional methods with reckless abandon. However unlike \"Haruhi\", there is a meta-textual method to its madness; a commentary on how stories never actually have a fixed beginning or a conclusion/ending to it. What we read and watch is only a fragment of something that is much bigger and it continues long after the final reel goes pitch black. So when you are tasked of telling a story as big as \"Baccano!\", are there any main characters, or just a lone person of many who the narrator arbitrarily picks? I feel that it's an suitable theme for a story about immortality, and especially \"Baccano!\".\nMost media portray immortality the same way, something that does sound nice but it actually is not - a route \"be careful what you wish for\" fable. It would not be a surprise to see Baccano! also abandon this idea and embraces immortality with open arms because life is an excellent thing. As long as the life you are living are filled with friends and family to live it with, forever. Seriously, why wouldn't you want to live forever?\nThis life is amazing since it is populated by these friends this anime. A suit of eighteen which includes the [Jokers], [Thieves], [Murderers], [Gangsters], [Lovers], [Monsters], and a couple of idiots that make up the 'main cast'. There is Miria and Isaac, a truly lovable duo of happy-go-lucky thieves who has never been caught once for commit crimes because they execute them in the most profound and stupid ways. then there is Dallas, a young punk who is the worse thief, but only because he stole the wrong thing at the wrong time, accidentally. There's Szilard, quite the sinister character who has been scamming people with a fake immortality elixir, did I forget to mention he's an immortal? However throughout the anime he recreated the real one, however the unfortunate \"punk\" has stolen it. So his silent assistant, the emotionless homunculus, Ennis, is tasked of retrieving it. She was meant to, but she encounters this sweet boy called Firo, who is the new inductee to the Camorra mafia family. Then there is Ladd Russo, he is psychotic and maniacal with nothing but the thoughts of killing. He is aboard \"The Flying Pussyfoot\" with his gang of white suited assassins to kidnap a Senator's wife and child. However the white suits didn't count on the black suited orchestra to be a rival group of assassins, OR ON the Rail Tracer, a monster that preys on trains and consumes its passengers. Then there is that Gandor and Martillo Family, Dallas' younger sister Eve, the cult leader Huey Leforet, his mute daughter Chane, the capable but crybaby Jacuzzi and the supposedly sadistic kid Czeslaw. This is quite the colorful and memorable characters that \"Baccano!\" has left us with a hell of an impression. When it seems like the story is beyond your grasp of understanding, latching onto the strong and vibrant cast make the road to understanding a lot less bumpy.\nWhen you sit down and string the events of this anime into a chronological order it's still a pretty wild and crazy tale. Sometime like a Rube Goldberg machine, seemingly unrelated subplots that bump into other subplots, which coincidentally stumble onto other events before characters meet other characters in weird situations and strange circumstances, creating a surprise each step of the way. A little fun fact \"Baccano\" is Italian for \"rowdyness\" and it's an suitable description for this anime series.\nIn the animated movie called \"Highlander: The Search for Vengence\", there is an immortal character who will heal from nearly every grave wound. This gave the director Kawajiri a somewhat of a license to just dish out creative and outlandish violence. Baccano! doesn't hold back on its violence and not for the faint of heart. Heads will roll, if you could even say that what remained was a head, but even after that it will piece itself back together... on the screen. Also like \"Kurozuka\", it is a very creative and stylish violent series with so much blood spilling it almost paints the dining car of \"The flying Pussyfoot\" and deep crimson red. I haven't seen something like this since Hellsing. This anime is truly not for the faint of heart, but for people such as myself who enjoy stylish violence like \"Baccano!\", it truly feels like Christmas came early. It really aids the anime series that the animation looks great throughout, especially for a TV series at that time.\nYou'd expect a series mostly set during the Great Depression with so much violence and danger to be... well, just extremely depressing, however this anime is true a joy to watch. It's truly well thought out anime with such a large cast it doesn't even let each character to be protected by the plot to make them seem important. I say this, no one, not even these so called \"Immortals\", are guaranteed to come out of this hellish insanity alive. When this all wraps up, even with a few more stories left dangling, some justice has been served, some even find love. While the series as chaotic as \"Baccano!\" comes to an ending that is considerably mellow and flat, it left me very satisfied but at the same time a contentment and a desire to see more.\nStory: 10/10\nArt: 9/10\nSound: 10/10\nCharacter: 10/10\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nOverall: 9/10\n        "},

But what about me? What did I think of it? Let's find out.\nThe Story\nDuring the late 1930s in Chicago, the transcontinental train, Flying Pussyfoot, is starting its legendary journey that will leave a trail of blood all over the country. At the same time in New York, the ambitious scientist Szilard and his unwilling aide Ennis, are looking for missing bottles of the immortality elixir. In addition, a war between the mafia groups is getting worse. On board the Advena Avis, in 1711, alchemists are\n          \n        about to learn the price of immortality.\nNow something those who didn't check this series yet might not know, is that they have a \"Pulp Fiction\" style of telling there  three stories. They're told all at once. Instead of telling one, and going to the next afterwards. A technique that could be confusing at first, but you begin to follow it as it goes on. And you can tell which story is being told when it starts focusing on it. Plus, it has very creepy and interesting ideas of being \"immortal\", which are shown in very graphic ways. If there is one flaw with it's story telling, is that it has romantic aspects to it that don't go anywhere and are barely focused. There may be some things left barely touched, but it does give you many surprises that will keep you engaged.\nThe Animation\nLike a lot of animes I've seen both good and bad, the animation is pretty good. It captures the creepiness the show would have, and the movements are done perfectly......That's about it. Don't see any point talking about the animes animation, when 98% percent of anime has really good animation.\nThe Characters\nNow there are ALOT of characters, so I might just talk about the ones I enjoy the most. I'll first talk about perhaps the most popular characters, Isaac and Miria. They. Were. Fucking. Hilarious. Every time they've been on screen, it was just a delight. They're one of those anti heroes you can't help but root for just for how fun and nice they are. Caitlin Glass and J. Michael Tatum did a great job with the voices, capturing they're behavior well. Then there's.......actually, my favorite characters, Jacuzzi Splot and Nice Holystone. Jacuzzi is an interesting choice for a leader, because he doesn't act like one. He's cowardly and frail, but despite this, he always steps in to fight when his friends are in danger. That and his voice sounds like Greg Ayres talking through a cheese grater. Plus, I loved the relationship he had with Nice. When we discover there backstory, we see why he has that tattoo on his face, and why Nice is scarred and has one eye. I won't say due to spoilers, but what Jacuzzi did for Nice is one of the nicest things ANYONE could do for another. Nice Holystone was just as awesome. An expert with explosion, and at times fangasming at her own. But also has a sweeter side. Ennis was your typical emotionless girl that gains human emotions and independence from hanging out with Isaac and Miria. (Possibly) But to be fair, it's done very well. And she is an interesting character. Benjamin was just creepy to me (At first). He suffers from what IrishAnimeFan  calls \"Signs Syndrome\". In which he's a kid who acts more like an adult then.....well, the adult characters. But as we get farther into the show, we discover his past somewhat and all the horrible things he's endured, and you just feel sorry for him. But one downgrade is that he screams like a girl. Most of the other characters are mostly psychotic killers, nice guys, and innocent children, so you'll have to see them for yourself. This is a huge cast of characters, but the ones that stand out, REALLY stand out.\nOverall\nThis was an exhilarating ride. If you enjoy animes with a great combo of Action, Comedy, and some Drama, (Like Cowboy Bebop) this title is right up your ally. The only warning I would give is that it's very gory at times, that it ALMOST reaches \"Elfen Lied\" standards. I give this anime an 8 out of 10.\n        "},

The character designs are actually quite memorable. I still remember Chane's face when she got mad at Ladd for saying that she was just being used by Huey. \nAnimation: Really not all that great. Watch episode 3 the Firo vs Dallas fight. It was choppy as fuck. It actually used triple framing. Yeah okay, it's only a TV series, so you can't expect it to be like VHD Bloodlust which had single framing, but even fucking NARUTO had double framing. Baccano uses triple framing for its\n          \n        fucking FIGHT SCENES which makes them look choppy as fuck. Really bad fucking idea. Whoever directed Baccano deserves a slap for not prioritizing fight scene animation. \nChoreography: It might have been good, but due to the choppy as fuck animation I couldn't tell what was going on even when I went through the anime frame-by-frame. Yes it was that choppy. Some fight scenes looked like they might have been quite good if they hadn't been animated at 5 frames per second. \nConclusion: A potentially good series ruined by shitty animation. Fight scenes like Firo vs Dallas deserved received better treatment. I was really looking forward to the Claire Stanfield vs Ladd Russo fight too, which was also ruined by choppy animation and directing. Very disappointing. \n        "},

It's a bit hard to get into at the start (this is really a show that works well on rewatch), but once you're in, it's amazing. There are a lot of time, geographic, and narrative time shifts that are just... wow. I would give you a plot synopsis, but I really can't. For starters, it's very, very complicated. After that, it's spoilers. There's alchemy involved. And a train ride. And gunfights. And knife fights. And wrench fights. And romance. And the Mafia.\nI enjoyed the art. It was experimental, matched the quick pace of the narrative and just looked really fluid and\n          \n        detailed, which really worked.\nThe music was great. The dub is worth watching, because this is a mixed cast: it features a number of different ethnic groups, and the dub pulls them all off rather well, or at least gives you the sense that these are people from an assorted number of backgrounds.\nThe characters are the life of the show and I loved them all, even the antagonists, by and large. And when your cast includes a sadistic serial killer, an ADD mechanic who just likes to Hulk Smash when he gets excited (favorite char btw), a psychopathic assassin who has no qualms coating himself in other people's blood, two people with the personalities of hippies on loads of acid, an orphan gang unafraid of using explosives, and, well... yeah. There's some crazy characters in there. I might be a little biased, since I seem to like crazy characters over normal ones, but they're all awesome.\nThis series also made me laugh so much. There is also so much beauty in the way the story and characters were crafted.\nI highly suggest that, if you like this, you go see \"Durarara!\", which was made by the same people. It's not the same thing, although it does feature a couple of similar elements (large cast, flashbacks, flashforwards, crazy people, a touch of the supernatural, gangs, etc.). It takes place in the present day. I personally think that \"Baccano's\" overall story is better, but \"Durarara!!\" has some real gems of its own (especially the ending OVA).\n        "},

A character is a caricature.\"\n   -Ernest Hemingway\nThe thing that makes a story truly great (or truly awful for that matter) is the cast that drives the story forward. A clear, strong plot where these characters interact is what creates tension, and usually, these two elements are intertwined in a way that drives the story forward as seamlessly as possible. However, Baccano! more or less tossed the \"plot\" aspect of that formula out the window and decided to do something completely different.\nBaccano! was originally a light novel series by Ryohgo Narita\n          \n        with Katsumi Enami as the illustrator but was developed as an anime by Aniplex and Brain Base. The huge cast of this story makes telling it a rather daunting affair, so the creators were forced to try something different: that is, telling the story from multiple perspectives at once. In addition to changing point of view rather often, it also skips around from year to year, and doesn't tell the story in a linear fashion, as most shows do.\nSo, if it's told in such an unorthodox way, is it any better?\nBreakdown:\nStory (6/10): Baccano manages to cram an awful lot of stuff into a thirteen episode span. From the hijacking of the \"Flying Pussyfoot\" to the Gangster wars in New York to the search from the elixir of immortality, there's quite honestly, a lot to wrap your mind around. However, the thing that makes it tough to absorb is how the story jumps around so much. Upon the final episode, it's easy to sit back and connect all of the events together, but in the middle of the show, you may be wondering what's actually happening.\nThe beginning of the show doesn't offer much explanation of what it's showing, and it will probably take you until nearly the end until you're able to connect all the dots. Unfortunately, the plot is pretty straightforward, so any further synopsis would just start to spoil things. This was what I felt was the weakest part of Bacano: the story.\nWhile the story itself may not be all that strong, the unique way in which Baccano! is presented is what ultimately makes the viewing experience so engaging. The story may be fairly simple, but the piecemeal manner in which it is told made it difficult to understand at first. I suppose if it had been told in a linear fashion, it would have been a rather boring watch. This is an example of good storytelling making an otherwise average story quite engaging. \nThe other thing that made it difficult to understand was the HUGE cast in the show. There are dozens of names to remember, and keeping track of them all is no easy feat. Here I do have to applaud Baccano! for introducing the cast  in the opening credits, and thus, making it easier to remember the many names and faces. The opening also offered a brief synopsis of previous episodes, which made it easier to keep track of what was going on.\nIn spite of all the twists the story takes to arrive at its ultimate conclusion, I wasn't especially impressed by the end. It was still a good story, but it seemed like the show had a lot of great ideas that could have been expounded upon quite a bit longer. Baccano! could have easily been 26 episodes without dragging. Furthermore, some of the plot's most important aspects, such as the elixir of life, don't really get any further explanation. The viewer is just left to assume that everything just sort of works itself out. Now, drawing out the ending too long would have made it lose a lot of its impact, however some further explanation on some of the plot's more intricate aspects likely would have helped.\nThere is plenty of catharsis at the end of the show, but most of it is due to the way characters ultimately overcome some of their personal demons. A bit strange, considering the show was largely plot-driven until the end. It’s not that the plot was bad, it was just very simple. Simple, yet told in an unorthodox way that made it a touch hard to follow. \nArt (10/10)- Good animation can make a good show even better. Baccano! really has some stellar artwork, especially in the combat scenes that have a lot of rapid movement. It's amazing how well some of the blood and gore scenes were drawn, which normally, I wouldn't care about. However, violence can just be cheesy if it looks like \"Kool-Aid\" is splashing from wounds instead of blood. Overall, excellently done; probably the show's strongest point.\nSound (9/10)- The OP of this show was addicting, and reminded me of \"Tank\" from Cowboy Bebop. The score overall fit the era and themes of the show perfectly, and added some wonderful atmosphere. I especially loved the piano theme that often accompanied battle sequences, and the big band numbers for the gangster scenes.\nThe voice acting is also top-notch, even in the English dub. This show's English version is on par with some truly great ones, such as Cowboy Bebop and Fullmetal Alchemist. There were a lot of Boston, New York, and even French and British accents to do in this show that would have been lost with the Japanese voice actors. The lines just sounded a lot more authentic when they were spoken in their local accents. I would recommend watching this show in English, as the voice actors are truly superb, and you won't hear that from me very often.\nCharacters (8/10)- Although the OP of the show introduced most of the cast, it was still quite difficult to keep track of everyone, especially when some have names like \"Jacuzzi Splot\". In addition to those that are introduced, there are plenty of characters that pop up without an introduction, whose names are worth remembering. Keeping track of this group is even more difficult.\nThe one fault with this method of introduction is that the viewer will expect each of the characters to be important in some way. However, not all of them are. Some of the \"title\" characters have almost no influence on the story, and some that do, aren't shown in the opening. Furthermore, the connection that many of them share is loose at best.\nHaving said all that, the characters are actually done quite well. The ones who get significant screen time undergo quite a lot of development, and watching their character arcs come to a close is very satisfying. This is largely what provides catharsis at the end of the show, perhaps more so than the resolution of the plot itself. As I quoted at the beginning, characters have to be “real people” and not “caricatures” for the story to seem real to the viewer. There were a few members of the cast that easily could have fallen into the latter category, but were able to remain “real people”. This is where I was truly impressed by the show, as keeping each member as their own unique entity, rather than some sort of stock character, is quite a challenge for such a large and diverse cast.\nAll in all, the cast was a strength rather than a weakness, as the \"main\" characters are all very well-written characters. The problem is that you spend half of the show sorting through the list of names, trying to figure out which ones the \"main\" characters actually are. If the cast hadn't been so dauntingly large, it would have made things a great deal easier to understand. That, or perhaps the story should have been extended by a few episodes.\nThere are three OVA specials that expound a bit on some of the more important characters, and help to close off a few more loose ends, but the plot is ultimately resolved by the end of episode 13 of the original series. The OVA's are helpful, however, for a better understanding of a number of the characters, and I strongly recommend watching them after completing the series.\nDespite my complaints about the size of the cast, don't be scared by the larger than usual numbers. The characters are great fun, particularly members such as Isaac and Miria, and you'll be quite glad you got to know them by the end.\nEnjoyment (8/10)- For me, Baccano! felt like a series that was very good, but could have been OUTSTANDING with just a bit more work. Much more plot could have come out of the way they set everything up, and the huge cast could have eventually become a large asset rather than just a small one. Watching characters like Jacuzzi change and overcome their fears made the show very much worth watching, even if it takes awhile to realize who the story is truly centered around.\nOverall (8/10)- It may seem that my criticisms were harsh, but ultimately, this show is still very good, and stands head and shoulders above most other titles out there. I have to congratulate the creators on doing something unique, even though the “unique” aspect just made a simple story seem deeper than it actually was. \nI suppose I should answer the question I posed at the beginning. Is the show any better off because of the unique way it’s told? I would have to say, yes it is. The unique way the story is presented makes it far more engaging than it otherwise might have been. And at thirteen episodes, it’s not like you’ll have wasted a great deal of time watching this show if you dislike it.\nGive it a shot; you won’t regret it in the end.\n        "},

I also applaud the series for the creativity in the method of writing. \nArt 7/10\nThe Art sometimes looks like a candy eye to the viewer and sometimes it looks as a product of laziness from the artists, the gore scenes though are handled really well , the animation sometimes gets fluid but other times there are some choppy scenes. I was not impressed with the art.\nSound 10/10\nThe Opening , The Ending , The Music , The Voices , Everything in it is just perfect , A plus for the dub version is for using Slang terms that fit within character but I overall prefer the subs because it is livelier and gives a better attachment to the characters. the music perfectly fits within the show.\nCharacters 9/10\nA series with such an unconventional storytelling must have an unconventional way for introducing the characters , and that is the next best thing in this series  , with an equal love to each character , you don't get to follow one character but many, you get to experience every character's experience from their own perspective. I couldn't root for any character to be honest, the downsides is that I felt that the characters didn't get enough development and a feeling of emptiness that you want to see more but that is not a con , the only con I see is its hard to keep track of who the characters are. you will find yourself forgetting the characters names a lot and even though the opening helps you remember them , you feel like needing to memorize them.\nEnjoyment 10/10\nWell , It was hell of a ride *Literally* , even when I didn't like the art I didn't seem bothered by it , Especially with a cliffhanger at every turn , I doubt it won't be enjoyable by anyone.\nOverall (10 + 7 + 10 + 9 + 10) /5 = 9.2\nCeiling 9.2 = 10\nso its a 10/10 (Masterpiece)\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    *This is archived from my Anime-Planet account*\n\nCritic's Log - Earthdate: February 17, 2013. Review #36: Baccano!\n\n\nGreetings, Ladies and Gentlemen. I have a little lecture before I begin? Would you like to know what makes a story memorable? Besides the settings, It's themes and characters. Themes are essential to a story especially with the characters, and the characters are important too because the average viewer or reader may identify with one or some of the other characters because of either similar characteristics, personality, or perhaps similar events. There are many novels and movies that have stood the test of time. Another important factor about characters would\n          \n        be personal character flaws. It is an effective idea since it would make the viewer or reader to understand with empathy and sympathize with the character in the story. There are often times when something is made for the sake of entertainment and stories sometimes can stand out in cases like this. Like us humans, we are not perfect, not everything is perfect. Some things do stand out as Masterpieces. What happens after people watch or read something, they either discuss whatever they saw or read, or they analyze it, or maybe even both. I do reviews because I am quite observant and because I have fun doing reviews. This time, I have a fun anime to review, so let's start this racket and get onboard!\n\n~A Critic Sits Down, Watches and Observes, then Analyzes and Reviews Baccano!~\n\nHere's how this ruckus starts, so listen up! Capiche? In 1931, Mafia groups are going around and whacking certain people. Let's not ask them about their business, shall we? The transcontinental train The Flying Pussyfoot is departing on her final trip, where something horrific happens and many passengers die. The White suits and the Black suits get onboard The Flying Pussyfoot, but that's not the only thing that happens. Maybe it started there. In 1930, some guy by the name of Dallas Genoard ends up missing and his younger sister Eve is searching for him, unaware that Dallas Genoard is in bigger trouble as well as causing trouble than she can imagine. Sometime around either of those time periods, the two bumbling thieves Isaac and Miria are commiting several heists. and in 1711, a group of alchemists are gathered aboard the ship Advenna, seeking to conjure up a demon who will grant them eternal life.\n\nTo those confused from that summary I just told you, allow me to make this clear. I told the summary like this for a good reason. Baccano! is told out of chronological order and was made that way intentionally, which makes this anime unique. The question is, where's the TARDIS when we need it? Just kidding. With the story being out of chronological order, this can make for a somewhat disorienting experience, but that is seriously put aside once we get further into the ride.\n\nTo be technical, this is a Brain's Base production and the attention to detail is exceptional comparing animes that are set in Western settings are not as well portrayed I guess, but the creative staff of the show sure did their research. The animation is pretty solid and is done very well in the show, there are a few hiccups along the way but the animation is full of chaotic fun.\n\nWhen it comes to voice acting, This comes to no surprise that this show is extremely fitting if you're watching the dub. Before I get on that, I should give the Japanese cast some credit that they were fantastic in this show. The notable Seiyus in Baccano! are Masaya Onasaka, Kappei Yamaguchi, Keiji Fujiwara, Daisuke Sakaguchi, Hiroyuki Yoshino, Masakazu Morita, Kenta Miyake, Norio Wakamoto, Sho Hayami, and Takehito Koyasu. Now that I mentioned the Japanese cast, I'll now mention the dub. Tyler Walker deserves a huge amount of credit for having a bunch of Texans (Funimation is from Texas) sound like people from Chicago and New York and so forth. There were newbies at the time and they make a huge impression for me while watching the dub. J. Michael Tatum and Caitlin Glass are delightfully terrific as Isaac and Miria. Todd Haberkorn is damn cool as Firo. Sean Hannigan is great as Maiza. The Gandors are well voiced, R. Bruce Elliot is also great as Mr. Quates. Brina Palencia plays Ennis spot-on. Monica Rial plays Chane surprisingly well and rarely do I hear her play a character outside her usual roles. Colleen Clickenbeard and Joel McDonald are terrific as Nice Holystone and Jacuzzi Splot (as odd a name Jacuzzi has, Just go with it) Jad Saxton is great as Eve, and Ian Sinclair is also great as Dallas Genoard. Jerry Jewell is terrific in this show. Maxey Whitehead was terrific as Czeslaw, and Bryan Massey is a delight to listen to and he had way...WAY TOO MUCH FUN as Ladd Russo\n\nTo make the long topic short, the dub is excellent and well worth listening to. If you're a purist, consider watching the dub to this show. It does not disappoint. The Japanese version is awesome too.\n\nThe music by Makoto Yoshimori lives up to the show's title with its loud jazz and other beats. It really is a groovy soundtrack to listen to without the show and it compliments the show greatly. The opening kicks so much ass and thanks to little clips thrown in during the opening, it makes the opening nearly unskippable. I seriously love the opening in this show. The closing theme \"Calling\" is great too. I've said enough of the music in the show. It's simply... Groovy.\n\n\nWhat makes Baccano! such a ride are the characters. Isaac and Miria are really funny since Isaac is pretty much an idiot and so is Miria, they have some over-the-top funny moments in this show which I remember quite well. Firo's pretty cool and Maiza was interesting. The Gandor brothers are also alright. Szilard Quates and Ennis were interesting. Chane is... *awkward silence* very interesting . I like Nice's personality and I like Jacuzzi's whiny personality very well. Eve is alright, Dallas is an A+ Grade douchebag (Just go with it), Czeslaw is an interesting kid, and Ladd Russo (like his English voice actor) is a delight. Ladd really makes the show...at times...ENTERTAINING AS HELL! \n\nThe only character I didn't care for all too much was Graham Spector. He was thrown in right on the last 3 episodes. Which he really throws a monkey wrench into all this ruckus. Graham Spector is a little underdeveloped but this addition doesn't really hurt the enjoyable ride. What makes the characters really stand out in this show is that the characters' motives aren't really all that great, such motives like theft, violence and so forth. Eve is the only character who's pretty much be a pretty little saint compared to the rest of the cast of characters. This tends to be overseen because these characters are fun to watch. My only nitpick for the show is that both the story and characters are smartly written, although out of order. The direction by Takahiro Omori is still unique but the characters do lack a little depth in the show.  Does this greatly harm the show? No! In fact, it's fitting in the show. Why? Because for those that don't know Italian (or for those that didn't look up the title's meaning) Baccano! is Italian for \"ruckus\" or \"racket\", which the show damn well lives up to its name and speaks for itself that this anime is both a trainwreck in terms of placing the story out of order and being one hell of a trainride in the long run.\n\nBaccano! is available from Funimation. The original light novels by Ryohgo Narita have not been released stateside, The manga called \"Bacanno! 1931 The Grand Punk Railroad\" written by Ryohgo Narita and illustrated by Ginyu Shijin also has not been released stateside.\n\nWith all that said, Baccano! made quite the ruckus with its scrambled storyline, enjoyable characters, groovy soundtrack, wonderful voice acting on both sides, and very good animation. This anime is quite the trainride that I think you might enjoy very much even though the story is derailed in terms of chronology. The show has recieved universal critical acclaim because of how unique it is. This is somewhat truly an anime equivalent to Pulp Fiction.\n\nI give Baccano! a 9.6 out of 10, it is EXCELLENT!\n\nFeel free to leave a comment. What's next for Baccano!? \n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n「SYNOPSIS]\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nDuring the early 1930s in Chicago, the transcontinental train, Flying Pussyfoot, is starting its legendary journey that will leave a trail of blood all over the country. At the same time in New York, the ambitious scientist Szilard and his unwilling aide Ennis are looking for missing bottles of the immortality elixir. In addition, a war between the mafia groups is getting worse. On board the Advena Avis, in 1711, alchemists are about to learn the price of immortality. \nBased on the award-winning light novels of the same name, Baccano! follows several events that initially seem unrelated, both in time and place, but are part\n          \n        of a much bigger story—one of alchemy, survival and immortality. Merging these events together are the kindhearted would-be thieves, Isaac and Miria, connecting various people, all of them with their own hidden ambitions and agendas, and creating lifelong bonds and consequences for everyone involved.\n[Source|http://myanimelist.net/anime/2251/Baccano]\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n「INFORMATION」  \n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nType : Series\nYear : 2007\nEpisodes : 13 + 3 OVAs\nStudio : Brains\nDemographics: Seinen \nGenres:Action, Comedy, Historical, Mystery,Seinen, Supernatural\nRating : R -17+ \n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n━━━━━━━━━━━━\n「PLOT」  \n━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nAn event can have as many stories as people involved in it and that is the core of a series like Baccano! There is an incident that can be counted in so many ways that there are countless storylines based on the different characters involved, which also include different times and places, all intrinsically interrelated.Thus Baccano choose to tell their story in a peculiar way, totally out of chronological order and alternating experiences of each of the characters, being each of them a gem.Gradually the mysteries begin to unfold, the facts begin to fit forming the magnificent puzzle that is Baccano! A thrilling story that does nothing but leave you mesmerized, always eager to know more. Fights inside the fascinating and entertaining world of mafias, an attack inside the carriages of a train where also seems to haunt a strange murderer spirit, a fight to get the elixir of eternal life. Baccano achieved combine all these elements in a really captivating, in a story of the most electrifying. It is better go without knowing much of the series and their characters, as the mysteries and stories that one is about to know never cease to amaze.\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n「CHARACTERS」  \n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nI really like every character in Baccano! \"- That was the first statement that I threw on my journey with this series. The characterization of them, the way they come to life and become downright unique, that's what makes the cast of this anime a gem. finally they are the ones that move the plot and who make every intimate scenes. Explain why we love the exuberant and extravagant pair of thieves, Isaac and Miria; the sadistic murderer, Ladd Russo, the new and skillful member of the Hammer family, Firo Prochainezo; the crybaby but capable bandleader, Jacuzzi Splot; the moneyed but determined Genoard Eve, which only wants to find his brother; among several other characters full of mystery and interesting twists in the story, it is difficult. Why? Because you have to see them to really understand the great presence they have on the screen, this captivating presence that will only make you enjoy your presence on screen. I think everyone fell in love with Isaac and Miria (because they are the great icon of this series) but each of the other characters are a universe in itself and there is no doubt that you will find more than one of his stories of your special delight.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n「MUSIC」 \n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\" Guns N Roses\" Paradise Lunch is one of the OP more iconic we will be able to find the middle, who never cease to be mentioned so perfect for the history it is, with that touch the years 30, the presentation of characters, the small synopsis of the episode in the middle of OP, all is configured to make this OP one of the most classic we can find in this industry. The ED is \"Calling\" Oda Kaori loses impact when compared to the ED, is a nice ballad, however does not have any visual appeal or emotional impact that engages the series. We can not say the same for the lovely soundtrack created by Makoto Yoshimori (Durarara !!, Hotarubi no Mori e, Natsume's Book of Friends, Kuragehime) and especially one of the best cast of voice actors that you will find in the industry ( really! the gem that are in this anime seiyuu is undeniable).\nThe spectacular way as each of the characters has a unique interpretation and A-1 is simply hard to ignore in this anime. I dedicate hours to appoint each of them, because there is no seiyuu that failed to interpret the thousand and one wonders in this anime.\n\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n「PERSONAL」 \n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nBaccano! It is many things: It's pure style is synonymous with doing things right in every aspect it's to risk something different and triumphs, is the anime you should not miss or stop seeing. The big names who are responsible for this work are Takahiro Omori Noboru Takagi in the position of director and composer respectively. They are also important names in the studio Brains Base as they have been responsible for greatest hits including Natsume Yuujinchou, Hotarubi no Mori e, Durarara !! or Kuragehime. The anime will take care of the writer's work Ryohgo Narita, also known for being who subsequently wrote Durarara !!, which was also adapted to animation enjoying great success. However, it is with Baccano !! who became known after winning the Gold Award of the 9th edition of Dengeki Shosetsu Taishō, one of the literary prize focused on more important light novels in Japan and which has served to uncover important authors and works tale as Hataraku Maou-sama or Spice and Wolf. It's amazing how it is an anime that envelops and captivates almost immediately, so it is impossible to detach it. This anime is Baccano! With a narrative completely unusual, this will encourage you poses a puzzle. How do you tell a story? Where do you start? Where did you end it? Who is the main character? Baccano teaches you that there is no straight answer to all these questions and to tell a story is much more complex than one would imagine. Therefore what Baccano! made in 2007 is telling a story from several different perspectives and in disarray. From narrate an event from the point of view of each of the characters, which have a past, present and future only to tell, which are added one after another to begin forming a sharp image at the end of the voyage. With a clear message, this series show us the beginning, end or development of a story is relative and depends on the point of view of anyone who decides to tell it. Unforgettable characters, mysteries and unexpected twists, a charming narrative form, a soundtrack of luxury, one of the most iconic OP in the industry. Baccano! It is one of those acclaimed anime that perhaps has not been as widespread as their counterparts. After seeing it I dare say that I consider it a \"Must\" and even a classic in the industry. One of those animes that anyone who comes to this world of entertainment should dare to see. In 13 episodes, and 3 OVAs that do nothing but add more to the fun, Baccano! It is a work that always dazzles so strong it is and how well it performs in all aspects.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n「CONCLUSION」 \n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nPROS\nIt's a great story with great characters and excellent technical section. Overall, I think it's one of those animes you can not miss because there are very few like this anime in the market. With an interesting narrative form, great moments and revelations, awesome characters, I think Baccano! It is indeed a classic that I hope everyone can see.\n[–]CONS\nI read that can be confusing, because of its narrative form that does not follow a chronological order, but I personally think that while it may bewilder quickly that obstacle is passed and the story does nothing but get better with each chapter and revelation.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    For a show with only 13-episode, \"Baccano!\" sure delivers in all areas. Thanks to fast-paced action, brilliant characterization and a clear-cut sense of the setting, one can completely get lost in the world of \"Baccano!\". The show's name translates to \"ruckus\" in Italian, and that's defineltly a word I'd use to describe is. A controlled ruckus, sure, but a ruckus none the less.\nThe story follows three different groups through generally different time periods (at points), but meshes things together to the point where your mind will explode. This can make the story hard to follow, especially for someone who isn't expecting it, but if you\n          \n        feel that you missed some things along the way (like I did), a second watch is totally do-able, and perhaps even recommended. The plot and storytelling mechanics really deliver a gripping ride.\nThere are a LOT of characters in \"Baccano!\" -- certainly a risk for a show that's only 13 episodes long. While clearly some get more screen time than others, each character is fun to watch. You can see them grow throughout the story and their interactions with other characters, making them seem very real, and very relatable. (Special shout-out to Isaac and Miria, who TOTALLY steal the show in every scene they're in.)\nThe soundtrack was composed by Makoto Yoshimori, who captures the high-swinging Jazz of the time period with grace and intensity. There aren't a lot of tracks on the soundtrack, but everything that is there fits with the show's sense and style perfectly. The OP is a MASTERPIECE, while the ED is alright. I don't know how the Japanese voice acting is, but the English dub is probably the best dub I've heard. The accents are ON POINT for every character, and are masterfully done.\nThe animation by Brain Base is fluid with great character designs. It's consistent through out the entire show, and really brings the city and its inhabitants to life. Coloring might feel a little off at points, but I believe that's purely subjective.\nOverall, \"Baccano!\" is a stylishly fast-paced show that really captures the true characteristics of brilliant storytelling, characterization and animation.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    TL:DR You have to hit the ground running with Baccano but it will reward you if you do. It’s a great and tight action-comedy that doesn’t let itself by restrained by such pretentious things like theme, chronology or even plot. Who needs main characters, anyway?\n_______________________________\nBaccano’s opening is a work of art, in how much it tells you about the show; It has this cheery jazz that let’s you know the time and place (the story takes place in the early 1930s US – mostly), its early scenes are reminiscent of cheap Hollywood heist movie that lets you know the tone and it introduces no less\n          \n        than 17 characters (and there are several important characters that aren’t in it), which lets you know that this show is as unfocused and messy as you can get. \nThe introductory narration, which is framed as a dialogue but is really the show talking directly to the viewer, basically tells you that the show doesn’t care about chronology (or much else, for that matter) and is fine jumping back and forth different settings and time periods at a whim. It’ll let you know the year every now and then, but that’s about it. The introduction may come off a bit pretentious, but don’t worry. This show is dumb fun, and it knows it.  \nPlot-wise, there a several conflicts in the show, such as a conflict between two 30s Italian-American mob families (one of which happens to be immortal, the other not so much), a train-hijacking by two different groups (one of them terrorists, the other just a bunch of homicidal maniacs) on the same train. There’s also an old alchemist trying to perfect his elixir, oh, and a nonsense horror story comes to life. Etc.\nMostly, it’s just an excuse to put a bunch of wacky characters in strange situations and pit them against one another. Sometimes it’s better to think of the show as a sequence of individually good scenes, rather than as a coherent story, although it is certainly put together with great care. \nBaccano has two main strengths: its cast, and its production quality. \nWhen I speak of production quality, I use the term in a very broad sense. The art is crisp (except for a couple of times where it uses moving 3D backgrounds, that weren’t all that well done) and the animation is fluid but more than that, all the dialogue is well written, even the throwaway exposition, and all the random action scenes are well choreographed and the like. There are very few bad scenes or bad moments in Baccano.\nIt’s overall pacing is also very good. You’ll never feel bored, but it also has enough quiet time that you won’t feel exhausted or overwhelmed. In a lot of the bread-and-butter technical aspects of making an anime, it is an exemplary work.\nBaccano manages to have a huge ensemble cast while at the same time having all the characters be both wacky and distinct. A lot of them don’t fit easily into any clichés (although some of course do, it’s bound to happen with this many characters), yet after only a few scenes with any given character, they still manage to leave an impression. This is mostly due to the show giving each character their own mannerisms and ways of putting things, and also good VA work. \nThe show doesn’t have much time to do character development (It having only 16 episodes, including the specials) but it nevertheless manages to do quite a lot in that time. It does this by only focusing on what’s important; unnecessary information such as how various characters met, what their exact relations are etc. is simply ignored. As a result, it manages to not only introduce a bunch of characters, but also to develop them some. It’s a punchline-without-setup kind of thing, but it works remarkably well.\nThe show also does this thing where despite the cast being made up of gangsters, thieves, maniacs, terrorists and the like, they all, with a couple of exceptions, feel kinda… nice. It feels like sitting down for dinner with these people could be a pretty fun experience, whether or not you survive it. Hell, even a demon summoned to give unholy secrets comes across as… pretty chill actually.   \nIn terms of weaknesses, it must be said that while the show thrives on being chaotic, rapidly jumping between different times and settings, it can get a bit too chaotic at times. You sometimes loose sight of which characters are and are not immortal, and which events happen before or after others. It can at times be tempting to write down an overview or visit the wiki, but I recommend that you don’t. I recommend that you just let yourself be caught up in all the glorious nonsense going on in the show and don’t think too hard about the details.\nSecondly, while the show sets out to be a dumb action show, and it does this brilliantly, it cannot go beyond its modest goal. I’m left feeling that if the same amount of effort and skill had been put towards a more ambitious goal, that a true masterpiece anime might have come out of it. For better or for worse, we got dumb fun.\nI mentioned earlier that the show doesn’t have a theme, but it actually does, in a sense. The show binds together a consistently light-hearted tone with remarkable gruesomeness (there’s a kid that gets tortured and has his head blown off, for example), by subtly insisting that nothing matters. Not life, not anything else. This basic philosophy undergirds the whole story and is what allows the various homicidal characters to appear likeable. After all, if life doesn’t matter, why should murder?\nPhilosophically, the show espouses a sort of hedonistic nihilism: it’s not that pleasure is the meaning of life, but rather, that since life has no meaning, why not enjoy it?\nLastly, a quick PSA: Watch the specials, the show isn’t complete without them. Baccano is a 16 episode show.\n____________________________________\nI started watching Baccano when I was a bit sick and in kinda a bad mood. Its first few minutes did not impress me. It all felt too messy to tell a coherent story, and its introductory narration felt like highfalutin nonsense (it is at times difficult to distinguish the self-aware kind from its serious counterpart), which I tend to hate (I hated it in Ghost in the Shell, for example ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯). By the time I realized that it wasn’t trying to tell a coherent story, I was cheered up and much too involved in the action to care. \nI don’t love everything about Baccano. A number of the characters fit into tropes that I universally dislike, and at times it tries to discuss some serious themes that lie beyond the show’s modest scope. I also found myself a bit confused several times throughout the show as to who exactly someone was, or when something was taking place, but this is not unique to Baccano. With Baccano, the trick is not to think too much.\nI see Baccano as being a pretty humble show. It sets out to give you 5 or so hours of good solid fun but doesn’t try to go much beyond that. Despite that, I find myself admiring its technical skill (not only in terms on animation but also storytelling and characterization), and I look forward to the day that enough time has passed that I can re-watch it with somewhat fresh eyes.\nAs a result, I highly recommend Baccano, it is great. 9/10  "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    BACCANO! ANIME REVIEW\nOVERALL: 9.4\nPLOT: 10/10\nThis anime revolves around the world of mafias. However, it is not your typical story in which both sides fight each other, claiming territory and the like. At first, you will go keep asking why? What is happening? Why is something like that possible? But as long as you go deeper on this series, the magnitude of the revelations, every pieces of the story which go into their rightful places are really awesome. Honestly, I'm really amazed at how this kind of series created. Eventhough there are too many characters in the story, there are too many scenarios that are taking\n          \n        place, there are too many question that will be bothering you, this series successfully made it possible to understand. They've answer all the questions, the loopholes, the whats' and whys' as the series goes.\nCHARACTERS: 10/10\nThe characters are very different with each other. They have different craziness inside of them. Each of them have stories that they wanted to share and they all have a significant role to play. Every character is interesting in their own way. Whatever side they are on, if they we're doing bad or they are good, you will not come to hate them. I'm awed enough to dislike them. You will come to see different kind of people with different perspective and views in the world with different traits and awesomeness on their soul.\nSOUND AND ARTS: 8/10\nThe songs on this anime perfectly fit the theme of it. Listening to it feels like they are drifting you to their world. It's just plain music but hearing it makes you feel jolly and in joy. Yes, the voices of the character did a good job expressing the feelings or the emotions they wanted to portray. On the other hand, the arts is kinda old? And somewhat too outdated? Dark? Though, I think that it is intentional. They've come from different time, 1960's and the like if I'm not mistaken. So even if it is intended or not, for me, it is still one of the criteria most of us pick in deciding whether they watch a series or not. At first, I do think twice if I will watch it since I'm not fond on this type of arts, however, I'm glad that I've watch this one.\nENJOYMENT: 9/10\nI did enjoy this series as it goes deeper and deeper. The secrets have been revealed. The puzzle is starting to be completed. The maze is starting to be clearer and a way is starting to show up. I really enjoy how this series goes. And how the lover in this anime always pop up and ruin the scene because of their not so funny humor. But yeah, they are funny, the way they are. Well, I do have tons of fun and amazement and enjoyment and my curiosity strikes and my mind was blown after watching this one.\nENDING: 10/10\nThis is the best part. The way the series end is too awestruck. It is too perfect. I'm just left with, \"What the fuck is this anime?\". My mind was stuck with how the brain of this author works. This kind of story is very new to me. It is one of a kind and it worth the time.\n        "},

The show arranges itself in a convoluted, albeit interesting way. Many individuals with separate stories and backgrounds are brought together by mysterious circumstances on a train to nowhere (ok, it is going somewhere). \nThat being said, that's about where the \"interesting\" part of the mess of a story ends. It seems like the author had some great ideas\n          \n        for small short stories. Not having enough material to create stories of their own, they were thrown together with the weak premise of \"oh these people got on a train together and mysterious stuff is happening\".\nIf I really wanted to watch something enjoyable with a train in it, I'd watch Thomas the Tank Engine."},

This series does a lot of things well. The animation in the series is a bit different but if you've seen Durarara! or even something like the Monogatari series it shouldn't come off too different. The music in the series is great and really sets the stage for dramatic or energetic scenes. The way the story is told is a bit strange in the sense that it doesn't only take on the perspective of the character within a certain event BUT also will break\n          \n        it down to what their roles were/what they did between a time frame. I feel like even though i wasn't paying heavy attention to it when I started the series i was able to piece it together and understand it. My favorite character hands down is Claire Stanfield/Vino. There are a lot of great/memorable characters in the show.\nOverall I really enjoyed this series and there is also another 3 EP's of the show you can watch after this series. I had a Funimation account EVS so I was able to stream it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Baccano! is one of the few animes that dare challenges the conventions set by previous masterpieces. It is unique in its style and presentation yet it is successful in its execution.\nBefore getting to experience the world of Baccano!, the audience is greeted with an opening that is very pleasing to watch. The upbeat jazzy opening allows Baccano! to establish its playful tone right off the bat. It allows itself to act as a very effective support in introducing the massive amount of characters, considering the show only spans 13 episodes. The ending soundtrack however was a slight disappointment, I did not find the same enjoyment\n          \n        sitting through the ending as I did with the opening. The ending is not catchy enough nor does it tell a lot about its world.\nBaccano! attempts to be fresh in its storytelling. Instead of following a linear storyline, viewers are instead presented with chunks of the story which acts as puzzle pieces to the whole story of Baccano! Viewers are expected to be bewildered at first by the amount of scenes presented however as I've said before, the scenes act as puzzle pieces which smoothly clicks by the end of the series. Baccano!'s story does not stagnate, it keeps moving in its own ever-present timeline. As a result what we get is a smooth and enjoyable ride.\nThe madness of Baccano!'s story would be severely lacking without its characters. The story is carried out by so much characters that it makes the story colorful. Baccano! is an example of characterization done right, each main characters are unique in their own ways. All main characters were properly explored within a time span of 12 episodes, each having more character development than the whole cast of Bleach. Each character has their own motives which drives the story in their own respective ways. This made Baccano! feel more like a symphony as opposed to a concerto.\nThe characters are represented very well in their design. Both character designs and their voice compliment the personality of the characters beautifully. Although stacked with colorful characters, Baccano! remains true to its overarching tone of the story. It is an overall tragic story, thus the anime is painted with a slightly dark tinge to it. However that colorful palette still remains to balance the story with its fun approach.\nWatching Baccano! is a 4 hours well spent. It is an extremely well executed anime with great characters and unique presentation. The magnificence of this anime does not stop there, its ending was a brilliant closure to the exciting roller coaster ride that is Baccano!, leaving the audience with nothing but a pleasant aftertaste.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    Baccano!\nThe faild experiment. Great story to begin with, giving authors many options to create innovative and original world.  And clearly they did not use it to the full extent. Instead they chose to spread the time on too many characters, witch some of made no sense, were surrealistic (compared to the rest) and had no background to explain to us way they are there in the first place and from were they had their powers; killing the story in the process.\nI must say I was very disappointed with this Anime. It is like the creators lacked focus trying to pack in as much as\n          \n        they could, and did not do enough research about this type of story telling.    \n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    This was pretty confusing to start with but once I got into it, I found that I really enjoyed it. It's pretty trippy in spots, even for an anime, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed some of the more off-the-wall humour: Isaac and Miria were particularly entertaining and I usually find over the top characters like that irritating, but I really enjoyed them. I also liked Claire (very original character) and Ladd Russo (brilliantly depicted sociopath and sadist). However, I found Czes' storyline vey grim (what is with anime and torturing children?!!!), and was glad to see him get a happy ending\n          \n        (of sorts anyway).\nCharacters are the most important thing to me in fiction and I'll drop something pretty quickly if there are no likeable characters. Baccano! had really interesting characters and there were none who got on my nerves, so in that regard, the anime earned a big plus from me. Story was a pretty original take on the whole gangster/mafia thing too.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    I've got one word to describe this series: Fun. Baccano(!) is straight-up chaotic, confusing fun. It's like walking into the wildest party you've ever witnessed, but you're there by accident and you have no idea what's going on or who's house it is. It's like a tilt-a-whirl of silliness and violence. It's like getting shot in the face with a confetti gun that's disguised to look like an actual gun--it's a ride.\nBaccano(!) is a hodge-podge of characters, fantastical concepts, and intertwining plot lines occurring across intersecting time periods. There are well over a dozen significant characters who are literally introduced to the viewer all at\n          \n        once in the opening credit sequence, and these characters blindly bob in and out of one another's lives and the primary plot, wreaking havoc everywhere they go.\nThe story develops non-linearly and events occur scattered across three timelines that are depicted simultaneously to the viewer. The result is a convoluted gong-show of a story that, if you can tolerate the temporary confusion and trust the writers, reveals itself to be a first-rate mystery that feels more like Murder Mystery Dinner Theatre than it feels like a cartoon. \nBaccano(!)'s muddled, cluttered story-telling is its greatest strength. The writers could easily have left stray threads, created plot holes, and confounded their viewers, leaving behind an inscrutable mess, but they demonstrate an attention to detail and a respect for their viewers that pays off for everyone in the end. The way the story is structured creates a mystery to engage the viewer in a way that would not be possible with a linear plot. The vast amount of information thrown in the audience's face is at once overwhelming AND engaging. Rather than passively absorbing the series, viewers are actively engaged in sorting it out, in organizing the characters, events, and interactions to make sense of the story. The viewer becomes detective AND historian as each episode reveals more of the chaos that has taken place. \nBaccano(!) is a brilliant example of convoluted storytelling that doesn't deliberately alienate its audience. It respects the viewer's intelligence while still challenging them to interact with the story. It's full of fun characters, alarming violence, amusing mishaps, and it's one of the finest short series you could choose to see.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    See, I can't write this review without saying that I have nothing negative to say about this gem. I have yet to find any show that has given me such a serious enjoyment. I literally started watching this gem when I watched glass reflection's review and gigguk's review of the show, and I am very happy I did, cause it is now my favorite anime of all time. Okay let's get started.\nstory:\nthe story takes place on four different times. 1930, a train robbery in 1931 (the main one), in the 1700's and 1932. all three of these stories weave together so perfectly, it leaves no\n          \n        plot holes. and what's even more amazing is it is told in a non linear fashion. it gives you the end first, the middle scattered everywhere, and the begging somewhere in between the end and middle, oh you get the point. but that's what makes this story so unique and amazing. no plot holes with such an advance way of storytelling. The only downside COULD be that you might get lost, so I definitely will say you gotta watch this show with your brain completely on so you know what's going on, and for people who don't like complex stories, no worries, the show's so much fun that it makes you not hurt your head that much at all due to the amazing cast of fun charecters.\nCharacter's:\nThe characters of baccano! are probably the highlight of the series, because even though I believe music makes every scene, this show literally feeds off all it's characters because they are absolutely amazing. The characters can range from hilarious and popcorn gold matireal, to psychotic and crazy killers. The best is easily Issac and Miria, who are the only ones that tie up all stories together, and are the most well written characters ever. I can't mention any others because it's just better to watch and see the awesome characters for yourself.\nArt and animation:\nThe look of baccano! is totally fitting and perfect for the 30's look it was going for. you can tell the creators totally wanted to make this feel legit old school looking and did some serious thought and research into how the setting and art should look, even the damn clothes look realistic 30's. as for the animation, baccano! has animation that eventually grows on you, because it is not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but you can definitely see the quality as the show moves forward by god they definitely made sure the gruesome bloody scenes shined cause they amazingly do! Aniplex and Brian base made an interesting look here.\nSound and dub:\nThe music in baccano! is easily the catchiest thing I've ever seen in anime. Swinging jazz and one awesome toe tapping opening, even the scenes flow with the old school music very very well. Now a lot of people diss the ending theme of baccano! but I feel the song in and of itself is good, it just draws you away because unlike all the other songs in the show, it's not jazzy. But you may disagree with that as it is my biased opinion on the matter, but you will have to judge for yourself. The dub however is amazing, no voice actor in this show is someone you know and they all do a FANTASTIC job on bringing these characters to life, as this dub is so good, i refuse to watch it subbed (although i'm sure the sub is just as good if not on par). the only thing i will say about the dub is that some of the Brooklyn accents sounded a little forced and some of them almost sounded the exact same. But this won't affect your enjoyment because I didn't notice until i watched the show the second time around. \noverall, baccano is a show that you will never see another like. It has an amazing amount of rule of cool and well written characters, good violent fun, a story too amazing to ignore, a praise for the fact there are shows like Naruto that can have a show of hundreds of episodes and yet have shit for a story, and this does a fantastic job with just 16 episodes, three of which are specials, so technically just 13, a soundtrack that few can rival and good hold on solid animation. I give this show a solid 10/10 because if there's any show that deserves it and doesn't get it, it's this one.\nRating: 10/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    	I’m surprised to see how little recognition Baccano gets in the anime community, despite its positive reviews. Because an anime about alchemists and mafia sounded like fun, I decided to check out the much praised show and was definitely not disappointed. \n\nSTORY: 8/10\n	The story of Baccano certainly lives up to its title, which is Italian for ‘turmoil’ or ‘ruckus.’ In Baccano, viewers are swept along a turbulent river that is the storyline: a river that has time jumps on every twist and turn. The reason why it may be difficult for some to follow the events is because they are scattered both in time and\n          \n        place. Although the main story takes place in 1931, a large portion of the plot takes place in 1930, and sometimes jumps to 1932, the aftermath (not to mention the jump to 2001 in the very end). \nBaccano doesn’t have a definite conclusion, either; it’s left to the viewers to piece the story together like a puzzle. Watching Baccano is like having a glimpse at one piece of that puzzle a time, and figuring out where they belong on an imaginary board as the story goes along. I personally enjoyed this layout a lot, because the story actually required me think and remember all events in order to make sense of the plot. If you want a simpler piece of entertainment, though, then watching Baccano might not be a good choice.\nEven though there is no clear ending, that doesn’t mean that the conclusion isn’t satisfying. There are some threads left loose, sure, but I still felt like the story was more or less complete. Everything fit perfectly into 13 episodes. It was a short anime, but it didn’t need to be stretched out more, because there was so much going on in each and every episode that there was time for everything in its runtime. \nSomething that bugged me a little about the story, though, was its beginning, where two obscure characters discuss about how they are going to write a story for a news article (the story they want to write being the actual story of Baccano). I wonder why those two were just left at that and completely disappeared. I was expecting them to reappear in the end, having wrapped up their news story, but they were never mentioned again, at least not in this anime, and that made the ending feel a little incomplete. If you want to know what happened to them, watching the specials is mandatory.\nDisregarding some minor plotholes, like all the deux ex machinas, Baccano is a well-written anime. (The great thing about it is that you don't really care about the mistakes it makes, because the anime doesn't take itself very seriously.) It’s a masterful blend of action, mystery and great comedy, the source of which is mainly the two comedic relief characters, Isaac and Miria. The gore in Baccano is just gory enough to make it thrilling, but nothing too graphic. To be honest, it had everything that makes an anime watchable, and it even went beyond that – it was short but good and certainly memorable. I might actually rewatch it, just to see how much more I can grasp now that I’ve gained an understanding of the main events and storyline. \n\nART: 9/10\nBaccano has good-quality animation. The action scenes are fluid and carry you along with every movement. What I liked the most about the art was the colors; the coloring in the anime is a little dark, like a half-lit street, but that just somehow adds to the atmosphere of the show. The character design is also pleasant to look at. \nSOUND: 10/10\nAs usual, the Japanese voice acting is well done. I didn’t know most of the voice actors, but they played their roles professionally. \nIt was interesting how Isaac and Miria had such an overexaggerated way of speaking (I mean, boy, was Miria’s voice high-pitched…), but that just added to their whimsical character, and was probably deliberate, so you cannot call it bad voice acting. Dorky characters deserve dorky voices, after all.\n\nMUSIC: 9/10\nCool music – Baccano pulls off jazz really well, giving the anime the atmosphere it needs. There are lots of happy and laid-back OSTs, as well as dark and mysterious ones. It’s probably something I would listen to from time to time, just because it has such a great mood to it. \nThe opening of Baccano, ‘Guns & Roses’, is super catchy, perhaps even more so than Cowboy Bebop’s ‘Tank!’ The two bear similar characteristics: they are both instrumental jazz and make you want to dance along at the beginning of each and every episode. ‘Guns & Roses’ has an uplifting jazzy tune that is a perfect representation of the 1930’s America that the story takes place in. \nThe animation for the opening kept me hooked as well, because it didn’t take itself very seriously and had cool transitions from character to character, stopping each time to introduce all of them.\nThe ending of Baccano, ‘Calling’, is nothing special, with some nice, slow Japanese female vocals, but that’s pretty much it. Definitely not something that would stick in my mind for more than a few minutes.\n\nCHARACTER: 9/10\nBaccano has a large extension of entertaining characters who, although they don’t get much time for character development, are all pretty likeable, or just intriguing. The weirdest thing about Baccano is that it actually has no definable main character. In fact, there are about ten of those, if not more. It might be a little overwhelming at first to remember the faces and names of all the characters, but it’s possible to get used to that after a while. \nIt really is a strange thing how little the lack of character development bothered me while watching this anime, since that is usually something I care a great deal about. Maybe it was because it was so short, but it’s a fact that Baccano made its characters feel like real people without spending too much time developing them. \nAnother thing I was amazed about is that Baccano actually made me like its comedic relief characters the best. Isaac and Miria were my favorites from the show, even though they were solely there to keep the plot moving with their clumsiness. They were plot devices, sort of; however, they were so adorkable that it didn’t matter. They were exaggerated in every sense, and still I didn’t find them that annoying. In fact, their exaggerated personalities, as well as their childish ignorance and self-centeredness, made them all the more enjoyable. \nBaccano’s cast was almost entirely made up of criminals, some good-hearted, some misunderstood, some just complete psychopaths. They were all very interesting and rarely fit generic character archetypes, or at least not to the point where it was noticeable.\n\nENJOYMENT: 9/10\nBaccano could easily be described in one word – fun. It was great fun to watch the story unfold while piecing together the events across different times and places. It had plenty of mystery and action, and had a great sense of humor as well. It was short, and felt even shorter because I was so into it that I finished it in two or three days. \nShort summary:\nSTORY 8/10 -  An exciting story with action, humor, gore, romance and mystery, all executed very well. The time jumping just makes it more interesting, as viewers will have to pay attention at all times to be able to tell what's happening. \nThe only problem was that the ending wasn't wrapped up well enough. Although the resolution was great, the show still separated the finale in the specials, which, I think, was not the greatest move. \nEspecially because I had to suffer through Graham Specter's antics to get my neat and tidy ending.\nART 9/10 - Very fluid, with slightly darker colors than in your usual anime. Just like its story, Baccano's art style is its very own thing, and a good thing at that.\nSOUND 10/10 - Awesome work, seiyuus. The music is the best piece of jazz since Cowboy Bebop. \nCHARACTER 9/10 - A great variety of characters, all of them with their own interesting features. They aren't as developed as they could have been, but the story goes so fast, you will not care about that very much. Also, they are just so lovable. \nENJOYMENT 9/10 - The biggest problem with it is that it was too short. Baccano is a fast-paced show with plenty of twists to keep you entertained. \n\nOVERALL: 9/10\nBaccano is awesome, and I would recommend it to people who prefer anime like Cowboy Bebop. (Although Baccano doesn't have an episodic layout like Bebop, they are similar in both mood and the fact that they are masterpieces.) It doesn’t have a straightforward storyline, but that just makes unscrambling the story more fascinating. It’s definitely not your ordinary anime, and a good one at that. If you want something short and entertaining, hop aboard and enjoy the quirky and fun ride that is Baccano. "},

It's difficult explaining in words all the awesome and win it contains, but as soon as you start watching, you'll instantly see it. \nOne of the most interesting things about Baccano is how it manages to tell its 3 stories of mafias, detectives and immortals all at once, all taking place in different times of the 20's and 30's, and all separate from each other, but also connected. No story is more interesting than the other, and the huge cast of fantastic characters keep things fresh and exciting all the way through. It's a\n          \n        bit hard to follow at first, but once you get used to the unique style of story telling, your in for one amazing ride.

The second reason is the opening: I’m definitly not into jazz but it’s so good and I love this way of introducing the characters =3.\nWhich brings me to the maint point of this anime: Characters! Many ones, different stories and goals, each one coming across the others in some way…I loved them all *o*\nBut the most impressive thing, in my opinion, is the scenario: it’sdefinitly the MUST of\n          \n        this Anime: so many sidelines stories connecting in a main one, in a weird narration. I felt like this time, we watchers aren’t taken for some jeks, maybe nuts, but not jerks. The way of telling the story is kind of messy: there’s no chronological order, we jump from a character to another, just like if the storyteller has just remembered a missing fact somewhere. Even though, I still could understand and follow the action (there’s a little come back before the action carries on which enough to connect with the previous facts). Besides, I was hooked with the plot lines: a mix of magic, crime, immortality, alchemists, mafiosi…It’d have been better if I could get to know some characters’ stories better, though: instead of Miria and Isaac long shows -which Icouldn’t find that funny-, maybe some Ladd Russo history or more of Jacuzzi Plot’s tears . In the mean time, I was impressed with the fact that the scenario was well-developped for a 13-episodes Anime.\n\nDespite the bloody scenes and the confusing moments, Baccano! is a pure jewel: nothing of fanservice/commercial/bonanza of the moment, interesting story&characters, impressive scenario and many uncommon miscellenaous things in the Anime world.\nLast detail: Baccano! means “mess” or “disorder”, which is quite the case but in a positive way …It reminds me of Harira..\nI’ll get myself a bowl..\n        "},

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    Baccano! is an interesting series. It's interesting in the sense that I wanted to like it more than I did. It has great characters which drive the series, and it's been hyped up by fans that love the delivery of the story. As I said, I wanted to like it more than I did, but alas, it sits at a low 7 in my book.\nThe story itself is what cripples this series. They took an incredibly interesting concept and packaged it into a mediocre (at best) story, and then they chopped it up into a jigsaw puzzle and threw the pieces all over the table.\n          \n        That's the format of Baccano! in a nutshell. It's done in an interesting way, but the story isn't interesting enough to be delivered in such a way.\nThe story is a simple one. If you've read the synopsis then you pretty much know the story. It's not complicated at all. In fact, it sounds more interesting than it is. I have not read the light novels, but I assume that they are at least better than this bare bones story where nothing substantial actually happens. I was bored for much of the series, but there were some redeeming scenes that were salvaged due to the wonderful characters.\nYes, the characters were great. If not for the diverse characters in Baccano! then I would not have made it to the end. The only complaint I have on the characters is that they were developed too late in the story. They were all introduced (and it's a fairly large cast mind you) early on with very little development. It jumps between too many characters each episode. Instead of focusing on 2 or 3 at a time they simply tried to fill each episode with the entire case. It made it difficult to get through the first few episodes, and when it finally shows you \"enough\" then the lack of focus becomes tolerable.\nI mentioned this series being a scattered jigsaw puzzle, which I think was a great idea (on paper), but they constantly switched between different years and different characters so that it felt as if the series itself had A.D.D. It was a tease that wasn't done correctly. I wasn't on the edge of my seat once during this series. When they finally showed where the immortality came from (which is still vaguely explained) it then jumps right back to one of the later events and times. It really needed to focus a little longer before it transitioned to a different subject.\nOverall the artwork and animation were ok, the sound was hit or miss at times, and the quality really was missing on the story and enjoyment. They had interesting fight scenes, bloody moments, hilarious moments, but then the drama fell very short. It definitely isn't the masterpiece I have heard others say it is. That said, it wasn't horrible and it may even be better on a second run (though I'm not rushing to see it again). \nIn short, I was bored at times, but I laughed at times. I loved some of the characters, but I did wait for a story that never delivered. It's worth watching, and I give it a low 7 (or a C- if you want to give it a grade).\n        "},

First time, I watch story with peoples are villain. There is no hero character. It is hard to explain what is about story and want tell you something spoilers. First time, I watch to first episode I am confused what happened to story line but I’m stuck watch to until 13 episodes and it give me to better understand and how it story line to process. Episode will show each of bits of story line to between two years. Each bit story of episode will fit to\n          \n        whole story line and will help you understand to more about story. I need watch re watch it make sure I can full understand but it not matter because I want to see what happened to end of 13 episode.  It is mixed of violence gangs, fight action, mystery train, alchemist and comedy. Baccano! is rare show I has seen. \nAnimation \nAnimation did a brilliant job.  Animation is bit darker but I not mind it. I admit I watch Baccano! on YouTube and it is hard see screen with dark style. Various place and character design is great.  \nStory \nStory is about wars between gangs, robbers and villains. It is long journey for Flying Pussyfoot(train). You never know what happened in Flying Pussyfoot. Some character are there in train. War between gangs in New York. Lot of story happened in two years. \nCharacter \nI will give you list of few character and explain to you what is like character. \nIsaac and Miria – They are goofy robber. They are stealing of stupid thing example they did stole door once. They love each other.  When they are always wear to different costumes then go in robber and to steal thing. Example they did wear baseball clothes and go to shop and steal thing. They always make me funny every time I see them. \nLadd Russo – He has psychopath personally and talk a lot. He just likes fun for violence. He is really deep loving his fiancée, Lua. \nFiro Prochainezo – One of member gangs, who is nice man with fighter skill. He have help to gangs for some job and protect them. \nI can’t tell you about other character because this show have lot of main character. \nWorth watch to it?\nYES! one million time worth watch it. Not give up after few episodes and still watch them until 13 episodes. I will plan watch again in future.  \nfree comment or critical to me what you think about baccano or my review and i will improve on my review. "},

At first glance, it seems like another 1930's mobster drama, which jumps around to a lot of similar looking faces. (Which isn't inaccurate.) But as events unfold, and plots play out, you'll come to find that there is so much more to this series than meets the eye.\nStory: \nBaccano! is a tortuous web of intersecting (and some not-so-intersecting) plots. The story is told from the (3rd person) perspectives of 6-8 different characters, each of which has entirely different themes, moods, and morals. When I found myself in the middle of the web, I was ultimately very\n          \n        happy with the turn out.\nOn a side note, I mentioned to a friend that I thought this story had it all. Comedy, mystery, horror, light romance, drama, history, and you know... Mobsters.\nArt: \nThe art is good enough that it doesn't drag anything down with it. It's dark and toney when it needs to be, bright and poppy when it should be, etc. It's very true to the story and to the mood of the story.\nCharacter:\nThere are, again, a handful of characters which could be considered the central characters. In the beginning you may find yourself drawn to one or two as favorites, and by the end, have landed on entirely different choices. Each character is very well fleshed, to the point that you almost never fully agree with a single character in everything, and always agree with them in something.\nOverall:\nThis may not be a top 5 for me, but it's close. It's a truly great watch, which I put off for a long time, despite being recommended by only friends with the best taste in anime, and ultimately am very happy with having watched. It manages all of this greatness in a single 13 episode series, no less. (Even the post-series specials are good!) Check it out!\n        "},

At first i was reluctant to watch it because i never heard about it. I'm glad that i eventually picked it up because it turned out to be one of the best anime i have ever seen.\nThe story to put it in short, is about a vast group of characters who all connect to each other in some way having conflicts with the mafia, plain crazy people, and immortals\nThe sound was a huge compliment to the show. The soundtrack could range from jazzy, to upbeat, to dark even the situation required and it\n          \n        was pulled off with excellence. To top it off Baccano has a great English dubbed version with many diverse accents to bring to the table.\nThe characters are the best you'll probably ever find in any anime. They introduce a LOT of characters but they all have their unique traits which i think is hard to do in all 13 episodes. Issac and Miria are a dynamic duo all over the place and they are just a blast to watch.\nI really enjoyed this anime as it had all the components to make an anime great the characters, the music, the story, they all just blended perfectly. The turn off people might have with the show is the unorthodox way off the time bouncing around but i actually appreciated how the show was able to do unconventional story telling and finishing it connecting the dots.

Thankfully Baccano! successfully pulls this out of it's hat and gives us an action packed, awesome and hilarious series.\nStory: Baccano! successful keeps us captivating with it's interesting plot-lines. Multiple stories going on at the same time, and each story being as awesome as it can be. It really does make you ask yourself \"What's next on Baccano?\". Although, there are two things that the story could improve on. One deals with a plot-hole that contains spoilers, so I can't explain that, and that part\n          \n        of the story has a good ending anyways, so, it doesn't matter. The second part is that there are 1-2 episodes that focus more on the characters and seem to slow the plot down. But other than that, it's pretty damn good. Oh, and if it confuses you the first time around, it'll make more sense once you see it again.\nCharacters: Almost all the characters are pretty cool. To go into why each character that is awesome would take all day. But I will say, all the likable characters are likable in their own unique fashion. These characters are well made. As for the ones that aren't as likable, well, I can go into that. 1st Czeslaw, while he's not a bad character, he does have plenty of room for improvement. 2nd, Szilard. Holy crap is he bad. He's just an asshole for no perfectly explained reason. He's interesting, but still crap. But despite those two, the rest of the cast makes up for it tenfold, so, no need to worry.\nArt: The artwork is simply amazing. Everything fits and it's not odd, or out of place, it's just right. You can tell the artists took there time to make sure that it flows well. It's just awesome, like the rest of the series of course.\nSound: The OST is really cool. It fits the time it takes place in perfectly, and still does a good job at carrying what we're supposed to feel at the time. This is an anime that I would watch dubbed. Because it's solid. Like really solid.\nOverall: Baccano! is a really awesome, and it's worth viewing at least once, if not more. I'm sure someone who watches this over and over again can still have fun as a person seeing it for the first time. Despite it's problems, it'll be a really cool ride aboard the Flying Pussyfoot. 9/10\n        "},

I am a great fan of the narrative device of the unreliable narrator and the structure of this show, involving multiple shift in perspective as well time creates a puzzle box of a story.  These types of 'mystery' shows that invite you to invest yourself in unraveling often suffer when the solutions to the puzzles presented are either blatantly obvious or not nearly as satisfying as those you came up with yourself (think Lost).

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    Baccano! (appropriately, \"ruckus\" in Italian) is a lot of things: Character-dense, fiercely non-linear, unflinchingly violent, challenging to piece together, and confusing to put it mildly. More than anything, though, it is fantastically entertaining. You probably won't have any idea what's going on until it's half over, but it's about as much fun as you can have watching anime. If Baccano were a question, the answer would be a resounding Bacca-yes. \nWatching Baccano! is like getting doled out handfuls of puzzle pieces with no box to use for reference. It's frustrating at first, but fitting them together is fun, it's satisfying to see the finished picture\n          \n        come together, and it turns out the picture is outstanding. Unlike most shows this good, the first episode is the weakest by far. Not because of the overdramatic narrator explaining to his young pupil, and indirectly the audience, that there is no single main character or hero in the story. (It is, incidentally, the only episode with any exposition–they're about the only characters who aren't in almost every episode.) No, it's because you won't have the foggiest idea what's going on. Nor will you until about halfway through the series (when it finally offers a single episode of background).\nThe reason being that Baccano! consists entirely of a dense knot of interrelated plot threads scattered across several years of time, and it constantly cuts--without segue--from one person, place, and time to another. You will, in fact, have seen about half of the epilogue by the end of the first episode, though you will have no idea that's what it was, who any of the characters are, what's going on, or what events lead up to that point until nearly the end. That's the only problem with the series--it starts out in such narrative chaos that you just have to trust that it's going to come together eventually, and won't betray you by falling apart at the end. Believe me, it doesn't--not only does it all fit meticulously, the end is flat-out spectacular on multiple levels. Exciting, hilarious, twistedly romantic, you name it.\nAs if keeping track of when and where the scene is weren't enough, the number of characters is staggering. You'll see no less than seventeen named people in the intro, and a montage of twenty three during the end credits, and that still doesn't include everyone. Those aren't just single-episode faces, either--most of them appear in every episode at least briefly. Not even mentioning the three crime families, two cults, and several other shady groups with their hands in things.\nNone of them, as the series states in no uncertain terms, is the main character, or the hero. Several could be, but Baccano! staunchly refuses to give anyone enough focus or screen time to rise too far above the rest. Somewhat surprisingly--again, as the series says explicitly--the main-est of them are probably the comic relief duo Issac and Miria, who through chance and luck just happen to be around during almost every major event. They're also even more clueless than the poor viewer as to what's happening (to hilarious effect).\nThe lack of focus doesn't make the huge cast any less intriguing. On the contrary, there are a half-dozen different people who you're likely to get attached to, and the majority of the remainder are interesting in one way or another.\nWhen I say none are the hero, I mean it; the cast inhabits the morally-ambiguous underbelly of Chicago and New York in the Prohibition era, and nearly all of them are attached to organized crime in one way or another. It does, however, have definite villains, including one of the more flamboyant ones in memory: Ladd, a gleefully psychotic killer who literally jumps up and down with excitement at the opportunity to commit mayhem. In any other series he'd have stolen the show, but here he's just another colorful, blood-soaked player. Elsewhere we have everything from cheerful young crime initiates, to brooding alchemists, to a professional killer as chilling as he is appealing.\nIndeed, I can't think of another series willing to overlap flat-out comedy and entirely serious situations so heavily, much less one that succeeds so completely with the technique. It's not a parody, either--the drama is real and the comedy comes from context, not exaggeration. Baccano! just has an incredible confidence in its ability to juxtapose serious characters and situations with silly ones without ruining either. Confidence that is entirely warranted, I might add.\n"},

You are given different storylines, and you have to figure out how these are intertwined. It makes Baccano really hard to recommend tho, because it is hard to say what this anime is about. Baccano covers so many topics, and, sadly, some of them remain undeveloped. The narrative is Baccano's strongest feature,\n          \n        because I guess that is the only one can blend many different stories, without bothering so much with long-ass exposition. The main purpose of Baccano isn't to flesh out perfectly so many different stories, but to make them work together as a greater story. \nArt: 6/10\nIt was...ok? I don't know, I really liked the character design, though it could have been better. The animation is pretty wacky now and then.\nSound: 10/10\nOh my God, this soundtrack is truly amazing. Not only the opening, but the whole soundtrack. Easily one of my top 10 soundtracks.\nCharacter: 9/10\nI really liked most of the character of Baccano. Except for Szilard. Fuck him. Most of the characters have unique traits, and there are some of them that show such a great character development, like Ennis, Czeslaw and, surprisingly, Ladd. I really, really loved Miria and Isaac's weird chemistry, and Jacuzzi's evolution. Sadly, there are some characters, such as Nice, Chane and Rachel, that are too left out. I really want to know more about them. And about Claire too. I hope that the specials will show more of them.\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nBaccano is pretty enjoyable, though it's confusing at first. It takes a while for the viewer to get accustomed with the characters and the strange narrative, but once he does, it is pretty hard not to love Baccano.\nOverall: 9/10\nBaccano is a great show, with various characters, a great soundtrack and a much greater story to tell. So embark on The Flying Pussyfoot (i still laugh when reading this train's name) and watch how the stories evolve. And try not to get killed.\n        "},

The only flaw I found in the series is due to its length. Since the show is only 13 episodes, the  fast pacing  and the pretty large cast made the first couple episodes a bit hard to follow. However, I was able to get my bearings pretty quickly and the rest of the series was an utter joy. The\n          \n        characters all get some development, but the amount is again pretty limited due to the series' shorter length. Luckily, this is not too big a problem because all of the characters are all likable, funny, cool, bad ass or memorable. The characters are all still really good despite the fact that they don't have a ton of development.\nBaccano! has good animation, fantastic music (especially if you like jazz), a large cast full of great characters, some great voice acting (especially in the Dub) and a lot of variety when it comes to genre. All of these elements make Baccano! a blast to watch. An easy recommendation for anyone. I guarantee that there is something in this series for everybody.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Baccano! Review\nBaccano is a 16 episode long anime series, 3 episodes of which are OVA episodes. It was produced by Brain’s Base and licensed by Madman Entertainment, Funimation Entertainment and Manga Entertainment. It has both an English dub and sub.  \nBaccano is set in the great depression of the 1930’s in America and follows a cast of characters who meet each other throughout the shows duration. The basic plot is that it is a series of interlocking stories from different characters perspectives which weave together to create this great tale of immortal gangsters, circus assassins and bank robbers. This anime overall has a very\n          \n        pulp-fiction sort of feel to it and pulls it off very well and this gives the show such a uniqueness .The two most common places where the stories take place are New York City and the Flying Pussyfoot express which is a train running from Chicago to New York. \nThe plot for Baccano is fantastic. It jumps from story to story fluently and explains itself wonderfully. The plot drives the show and instantly gets you hooked in the first episode. The thing I find the most interesting in episode 1 is how they show you so many spoilers but they are so disjointed that they don’t mean anything to you and I think that it is brilliant. The show switches between its 3 plots effortlessly and although can get confusing at times it still manages to keep you highly entertained. However some people may get confused because of the switching between plots and the information given and I confess I have watched this show 3 times and I am still learning new things about it. \nBecause Baccano has not 1 main plot but 3 it is hard to distinguish a main character however some would argue that Isaac and Miria are the main characters because they featured heavily in all 3 plots but to me they are just important side characters. The truth is that there is no main character in Baccano. Everyone is a main character. The characters vary from mafia members to bank robbers as well as a psycho/monster/circus assassin called Claire Stanfield who also goes by the name Vino, who coincidentally is my favourite character. All the characters get a decent amount of screen time and development. The show did well in managing all the characters however some people would argue that the sheer amount of characters is a negative point for Baccano. However, I cannot say the same. I loved pretty much every character in this show bar a couple of annoying characters such as Jacuzzi Splot. Yes that is his name. \nTo me the animation looked flawless. It showed Baccano so well and provided pleasant viewing every time I watch it. The animation is smooth, clear and connected in all the action scenes as well as the scenes where things were a bit more calm and collected. Overall I cannot fault Brain’s Base they did a fantastic job animating this show.\nNow here is a question sub or dub? My suggestion after watching both is, dub. Without a doubt dub! It fits in so well with plot since it is set in America. The voice actors do a fantastic job in the heavy dialogue scenes and differentiating all the different accents that the characters have. No information or emotions are lost in the translation. I would also pick dub over sub because of all the information we are given throughout the 16 episodes. It’s easier to miss out chunks of information when reading subtitle than just watching the dub and I do confess you can still miss bits out but not the extent that may happen when watching the sub. Although it is your personal preference I just recommend the dub a lot more. \nThe soundtrack to this anime series is phenomenal, Baccano has tracks that fit for every situation the characters are faced in and it is used to high degree of mastery. The opening theme  “Guns & Roses” by Paradise Lunch is amazing, I can just sit and listen to on loop whenever I want it’s just a great song.  The opening itself shows most of the characters and their names which is helpful in the later episodes when the show is in full swing of weaving in and out of the various storylines. The ending theme “Calling” by Kaori Oda is good but skip-able (more for the reason that you want to find out what happens next than the ending theme itself). \nOverall Baccano is a bundle of awesomeness that you should defiantly watch. With its beautiful, animation, amazing characters, unique plot and epic soundtrack it’s a show that I think should not be missed. It had some minor flaws here and there but they really are tiny compared to the overall greatness of the show. Give Baccano a watch!"},

Throughout the show I saw myself enjoying more the allure of the setting than the actual story itself. The story is fair and the characters are fantastic, but in comparison to how perfectly executed the theming and the setting was done only the characters can truly hold a candle to it.\nThats not to say that this is a bad show, it's does decent in some parts but it clearly has some innumerable strengths that make the other parts seem much worse than they actually are. It's worth your time tho, it's probably\n          \n        one of the best works out there that takes place in this kind of setting.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I'm a person who's very familiar with the mobster genre. I've seen many great mobster films such as The Godfather, The Departed, etc. So because of this I became a big fan of the mobster/mafia genre. I always hoped one day if there would ever be an anime adaptation based off that genre. I would then ask myself would it ever be good ?? Luckily I had my older brother introduce me to a mobster series called Baccano! Is it any good ?? After watching all 16 episodes here's what I think.***contains MINOR spoilers***\n\nStory:8/10\nIts tells the story of 3 main events that occur during the\n          \n        Prohibition Era. What makes them all interesting is that  they have good action, memorable scenes, and characters that eventually cross paths with each other that leads to turmoil. The pacing of it all is so perfect, it doesn't suffer from fillers as each and every episode contains relevance and interest. There's not a single moment in this series where things start to slow down.The main flaw here is that it gets confusing. Baccano uses a Pulp Fiction like plot where the events aren't in chronological order and because of that it gets a lil too complex. For example there are characters that have roles in all 3 main events and it makes you wonder wth is going on. This is one anime where if you don't pay attention to everything, you're gonna get lost.\nSound:10/10\nEverything in this anime just sounds great; the music, the sound effects, and the voices. It has one of my fav opening themes in all of anime, it has a good song and it actually introduces the cast to us in case we forget whos who. What's imo the BIGGEST standout of the series is its dub. This series has one of if not the best English dub I've seen in anime. All the voices fit the characters' appearance and personality, and the dialogue is GREAT. The English dub is so good that it's actually one of those few animes that's better in English.\nArt:9/10\nNearly flawless. The animation was smooth and great for the most part but where it shined was during the graphic scenes as it does a great job at making it look brutal. It wasn't always consistent however for example, there are times where the coloring fades and the lip movements aren't perfect but it shouldn't put anyone off. What I really liked about it was that they kept away from those cliché confused faces most animes have. Each character has their own detailed that give them their own look. For example although most of it is rather basic attention to small detail like outfits and use of color. I also liked the design of the rail tracer he looked very scary in most scenes.\nCharacter:10/10\nThis anime has one of the most likeable casts in all of anime. Almost every character in this series is great and enjoyable in their own way. You had the hitman Ladd Russo who was a scene stealer, Firo who added style and sharpness to the series, Isaac and Miria who were the comic reliefs, and it just goes on. It also has my fav character ever, Claire Stanfiled a.k.a Vino. He's just one of the coolest guys ever and brought so much charisma every time he was on scene.\n\nFinal Verdict\nI was so entertained watching the series. I feel if a person is familiar with the mobster genre, this is a must watch and even for people who are in to fantasy. This is a mafia genre that has alchemists, homunculi, and even immortals. I felt the writing was so creative and unique that if a person were to watch this, it'll be impossible for them to dislike it. Baccano! is a great anime and it's imo very underrated.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    First of all I want to point out that this is definitely an anime worth watching! I would have given it a higher score but it was too short and a little confusing at times so I gave it a 7. I will do my best to keep it spoiler free but mistakes do happen. Now to the point:\nStory: usually I don't like it when the story doesn't have a main character and just shows too many different ones, because some end up being a bore... that was not true for baccano, even though it showed a lot of different stories it end up keeping\n          \n        my interest in almost all of them. They were presented in an original and funny way and then connected together. The only thing I didn't like about the story was that it was quite confusing at times, maybe that was due to how short the anime was but it gave a lot of information that got explained later in the story and remembering everything gave me a headache. If not for that it would have gotten a higher score from me for sure - 8\nArt: I never have anything too much to say about the art its either good or bad this was nice, nothing annoying on the eyes, well portrayed expressions, I've seen better and I've seen much much worse - 8\nCharacter: the characters was one of the best things about this show, there were many different characters each with their own personalities. There were honestly no flaws regarding the characters, there were ones you wouldn't like and ones you'd just love, all different and all equally interesting (well isaac and miria bored me but I am under the impression I am the only one who thinks that so...). - 10\nOverall I give it a 7 but I am fairly certain I would have given it a much higher score (like a nine) if it was a little longer since I feel like some characters didn't get as much development as others did (only by a bit though) and some things could have been explained better."},

Unlike Durarara!, it gets straight to the point, has hilarious characters and bomb ass action scenes. I only wish it had more episodes (yes im one of those trashy ong ass shounen stans. fite me bish). Anyways, the art is good, a little too good tbh. Those gore scenes were and the blood were on point.

The anime was able to pull off combining several stories that have various time spans.  The jazzy score/soundtrack for the show was very fitting for all the scenes, including the opening theme.  The opener really exemplified the characters' as well as the series' personalities (musically and visually speaking).  As for the ending theme, it took several episodes for me to get used to because of the saddened music, which contrasted the overall feel of the show, and the visual\n          \n        effects (I was kind of creeped out by the floating heads mixed with the rippling water in the background).  The pacing of the story was steady and balanced.  It hadn't rushed in introducing the main and side characters, but rather all 13 episodes were used as introductions and ensuing masterful stories.

I saw many people recommending Baccano! because of how similar it was to it and how the same people that made Durarara!! also made Baccano! so I decided to check it out and I ended up enjoying this much more than Durarara!!\nStory: (8/10)\nThe story of Baccano! begins during the early 1930s in Chicago and with many different characters going aboard the train called Flying Pussyfoot where all types of chaos ensues. The story in this much like Durarara!! is insane and unique that leaves you entertained throughout the anime. One thing that I liked in this\n          \n        anime was how all the characters have different stories going on which is called frame narrative and a interesting thing that happens with the story is how it uses a different way of storytelling by using transitions to different years that are either before or after the main story which as well have events going on so when they all intertwine together it makes it very satisfying to see. My only problem with the story is how you can get confused very easily if you don't pay attention to the story because like I said before there are stories also going on in the past and the future and there are also some of the characters involved in these stories too, so its very easy to lose track on what is happening in the other stories.\nArt and Animation: (7/10)\nThe art in this anime is pretty good, it definitely shows how it would look like back in the 1930s with its backgrounds and character designs. The animation is good with only sometimes looking a little choppy.\nSound: (8/10)\nThe soundtrack in Baccano! is great! I love the OP and ED to this anime and the jazz soundtrack definitely helps fit in with the tone of the anime.\nCharacters: (8/10)\nThe characters in Baccano! are all unique and likable and is definitely the best part of this anime. There are so many characters in this anime and they all get stories that are told from their perspective which helps them all develop as characters, the best part of this is that since the stories all intertwine all the characters eventually meet each other and help each other with whatever conflict they are going through at the time which is satisfying. My only problem with the characters is that there are characters that get much more development than others but this is most likely due to how large the cast of characters there is and how it has only 13 episode span.\nEnjoyment: (8/10)\nI definitely had a lot of fun watching Baccano! and the story definitely immersed me.\nOverall: (8/10)\nBaccano! is an entertaining anime that I would highly recommend because of its unique story and characters.  \n"},

I'm still not 100% sure. There are a bunch of immortals and their quest to keep/aquire the knowledge behind it. There is a train that is being terrorized by multiple groups. There is a girl looking for her brother. And there are a dozen more stories. The good thing is, all the connections make this a very interesting watch, but you will need about half the show to realize what's going on\n          \n        due to the anachronistic order of scenes. Once you managed to find out, Baccano is well worth it, but I think they mixed a bit too much, especially in the beginning.\n7/10\nArt:\nBaccano looks pretty good, especially the backgrounds. The prohibition era USA looks a lot like it, not very colorful but stylish. The male characters could have been more diverse (it was hard to differentiate all the mafia guys), but in general, everybody looks good and many interesting.\n8/10\nSound:\nThe intro sounded somewhat like a sitcom opening, which is kinda funny, since Baccano can be seen as one in the broadest sense. Catchy and appropriate. The music was fitting for the time period and always went well with the scenes. The ending was solid and the voice acting was generally very good.\n9/10\nCharacters:\nEvery once in a while there is a character that everybody seems to take to their hearts. Ed from Cowboy Bebop for example, or Kyouko from Madoka Magica. Baccano has TWO of these, Isaac & Miria (although they can as weel be counted as a unity). They are not the only good characters of course, there are tons of them. Which brings me to a major problem Baccano has (or major appeal, depending on the viewer): It has way too many characters. Even the main characters can not be reduced to less than a dozen, which is an insane amount for a 13 episode anime.\n8/10\nEnjoyment:\nThis one is hard to rate, because it changed throughout watching Baccano for me. In the beginning, I had no idea what is going on, who all these people are, what motivations they had or even in what order all this happened. The first 3rd of Baccano was more like a chore for me. Once I started to \"get\" it however, it became a lot of fun for me to watch. Should I rewatch it one day, I'm sure I will have a lot of more fun than the first time around.\n7/10\nOverall:\n7.8/10\n        "},

The story is a double edge that can confuse most people, and  the their is the one clip in the beginning that bears no relevance to the the 13 episodes, other scenes or situations could have accomplished the same means.\nA very catchy opening theme with a very contemplating ending theme at every episode. \nThe music is great change of pace and pilot to mafia/prohibition/Jazz style themes to\n          \n        other shows.

The story of Baccano seems to move at a very fast pace however this is due to the fact that the overall story consists of 3 smaller stories that move at a regular pace. Baccano seems to progress fast because of its unique way of going to its 3 different story lines. You have to pay attention to what's happening or you will get lost in the story.\nArt:6\nNothing really jumps out color wise in Baccano (at least to me) except for the color red.\n          \n        Red was the only color that I thought was supposed to stand out. This isn't a problem because in the 1930s bland colored clothing would of been worn by most people.\nSound:8\nThis is one of the only animes I've watched where the music really jumped out at me. It is extremely different than most other anime I watched and the music fit. The opening is in my top 3 openings for anime.\nCharacters:10\nOk so this was something that jumped out at me (when my friend recommended Baccano to me he only said it was great). When I first watched the opening I was stunned at the amount of main characters and the ironic part is this show is one of the only shows where I could remember most characters faces and names. Every character is so unique and likeable that I could remember people's faces. I already said the characters where likeable but I couldn't find one character I didn't enjoy.\nEnjoyment:10\nI love shows, movies, games, and anything else that takes place in NYC during the 1930s because of all the crime and the atmosphere of it. Besides that this show was enjoyable; it had just the right amount of seriousness and goofiness. I was glad to see this because I've seen some anime (cough cough Highschool of the Dead) that ruin the serious atmosphere with something stupid/goofy. Baccano doesn't do this thankfully and the comedy is seperated from the seriousness.\nOverall:10\nOverall great show not much more to say, I would say most would enjoy this show and with it being so short it wouldn't take most people much time to watch it if you were skeptical about watching Baccano.\n        "},

You also need to put them in a situation were the protagonist must stop the antagonist from eather doing something evil, stealing the leading lady, world domenation ect. That is called the plot. You can also throw one of your characters into other situations or put them in one the audiance would never expect, that is called the side plot and plot twist. That is what makes a movie the form of entertaiment it is today, and since the dawn of moving pictures.\n          \n\nBaccano! takes that concept and twisted and turns its guts out. \nThe Story is pretty much about a train ride in 1933 abord the Flying Pussyfoot, and all the terror and blood shed that occured there on its fateful ride. Meanwhile in New York, we get a whole cast of diffrent mafia characters, and we even go back to 1777 abord a ship were the ship crew learn of immortality.\nYou think you know whats going on from that little sum up plot? well, you won't. Baccano has a full 18 character cast. Everybody is diffrent in their own way, whether it be good or bad. But they are all a joy to watch, all the interactions they have at diffrent places and diffrent years helps unfold the story as it slowly moves along with each episode getting longer then the next. \nBaccano! is something all  movie, music and anime lovers will enjoy, and if payed close attention or on a second viewing (trust me you will watch it again) you will learn it is much more then just a watching experiance, its an experican in art, story telling and plot design that is truly unique and 100% original. \nTake care everyone.

I'll try to be as concise as possible to cater for those that want more of a \"heads-up\" rather than an in-depth look on the show.\n\"Baccano!\" is an anime that aired during the Winter season of 2007 and was directed by Takahiro Omori and animated by studio Brains Base. Baccano! is originally an ongoing light novel series created by Ryohgo Narita, the same person who made \"Durarara!!\". He also likes putting exclamation marks in the titles of his works.\nStory: 7/10\nThere are three main stories that happen in Baccano!. The stories range from a\n          \n        search for an immortality elixir and a series of misfortunate events onboard the Flying Pussyfoot. Honestly, I never knew what the hell was going on at any point of the show. They kept jumping to different years as fast as a sex-crazed pedophile finally closing in on his prey.\nCharacters: 9/10\nThe characters were nothing short of extremely awesome. Although there were a few disappointments, namely Jacuzzi Splot. With such an exotic name you'd think he'd live up to it by actually making things go \"splot!\"\nAnimation: 9.5/10\nI'm very fond of the distinct art style that \"Baccano!\" and \"Durarara!!\" share, but in the animation itself there were a few flaws that would generally go unnoticed.\nSound: 9.5/10\nThe music in Baccano! is simply splendid. Whether we're talking about the opening or the ending, the music is obviously well-done. Unfortunately, there was a track or two in the OST that didn't strike a chord with me and they definitely sounded a bit off.\nEnjoyment: 9/10\nI definitely screamed a lot while watching this. Seeing so much blood and so many deaths was just extraordinary and very enjoyable. I've been craving a good bloodbath and Baccano! definitely served me well. There was an episode that went practically nowhere though and that does take away from my overall enjoyment.\nRating: 8.8/10\n        "},

Each of the stories in the series involves several unrelated plots intersecting and crossing each other as events spiral farther and farther out of control. Immortal alchemists, mafia operated speakeasies, and many other elements of pulp fiction mashed together for a world straight out of the movies. Based on a light novel series by Narita Ryougo\n(From Anime News Network)\nPersonal Opinion\nThe overview that I found isn't exactly detailed. Baccano actually follows 3 separate storylines taking place over 3\n          \n        years: 1930, 1931, 1932. All of these separate storylines have common elements. Namely... the involvement of immortals (people who can't die).\nThe biggest plus that this anime has is the characters. All of them are really unique and different. You have a pair of dimwitted theives who unwillingly make everyone's life more brighter, an insane nephew of a Mafia boss who's only obsessed in killing, a crybaby who is actually quite dangerous... these are just a few of the kinds of characters you can expect. \nAs for the plot... the first episode shows all the characters together acting as friends... and we are left wondering how everyone unfolds. The next 12 episodes comprise of moments from the 3 storylines intertwined and exchanging randomly. The 3 storylines comprise of events in New York in 1930, a train crisis in 1931, and a search for a character in 1932.\nIndeed... early on, you'll probably be somewhat lost as to what's going on. But if you stick with it, by episode 7 or so, the pieces start to fit together... and by ep 13, everything is concluded and you're left w/ an amazing anime.\nThe final moments from the anime is worthy of a 5 minute applaud.\nNow... this anime has more violence then Claymore... however.. unlike Claymore.. it actually fit and it added to the effect, rather then take away.\nSo if you're up for a fun, bloody fest.. this is the anime for you\n10/10\nSimilar to...\n- Cowboy Bebop\nBoth have a jazzy feel to it\n- Fullmetal Alchemist, Buso Renkin\nAll these animes have elements of alchemy in it. (though the usages are totally different)\n- Any mob flick that you've seen\n        "},

I was so confused at the beginning and had to work on keeping up with what time period I was watching. The challenge of just keeping track is one thing I liked about it. Gore and the psychological part of it was great as well since those are part of the genres of anime i go for. \nThe characters are phenomenal. Some I disliked at the beginning but fell in love with in the end and had a deep sympathy for them. And there are plenty of characters to keep track of so just picking one\n          \n        to be my favorite was a challenge that was never won. \nOverall, the story is a good one, just hard to understand at times. The characters all have wonderful back stories and arcs. The art is beautiful and well drawn.\nHighly HIGHLY recommend. If you wish to watch an anime that will challenge your brain and it's memory, then Baccano! is the perfect anime for you.\n        "},

Is simply a wonderful anime, it is full of a great energy and originality that anime has seemed to lack recently, the action blends fluidly with the storytelling, which is unique to say the least, the characters are all likable and the story melds them all together in a perfect chaotic blend that fuses action, comedy and a fast paced ever onward chugging plot. Each character feels unique, a breath of fresh air full of personality, vitality and that energy that seems to fill the anime, interwoven into even it's calmer moments, bursting and crackling at the seams. The anime may seem almost completely\n          \n        gibberish to a viewer who comes in for the first few episodes, but fear not! Your brains will not have to go into default to enjoy this anime! After a few episodes it becomes easier to understand what is happening, and when I began to understand what was going on, when and why the effect was simply jaw dropping. The anime shatters through expectations, then proceeds to stomp those shattered bits into dust for ever doubting it. You will not be disappointed, the time it takes to watch this anime is negligible, so you can watch it casually and at your own pace, and the experience will no doubt, stick with you as strongly as it has stuck with me. I can guarantee it. This is a must see for anyone who wants to get into anime, I strongly recommend it, and must say that I am genuinly delighted to have an anime that is as fantastic as the one that I just sat through. Baccano! Is amazing, take a look, you'll be amazed at what you find. \n        "},

Ruckus, but in a good way.\nStory 9: A brilliant story told in a brilliant way.\nArt 9: Unique and different. The artist actually researched American history.\nSound 10: Outstanding soundtrack and good voice actors in both sub and dub.\nCharacter 7: Unique, but with not enough episodes to get personal with all of them.\n\n              Baccano is a story I stumbled upon by chance\n          \n        after watching Katekyo Hitman Reborn and I am glad I did because I enjoyed this anime from start to finish. Unlike so many anime before it Baccano challenges the way a story is told and tells it in clusters out of chronological order leaving the audience to piece it together. To some that may seem unappealing and difficult, but it is not as a hard as it seems and it leaves the viewer to become like a detective and gather the clues to get to the bottom of the story. What is the story? The story is not just one story, but three that come across as unrelated. One is about alchemists in 1711 learning the secret of immortality. The second is about the tragedy that happened in the transcontinental train, the Flying  Pussyfoot. While the last one is about the war of the Mafia causing a ruckus. As you watch this anime which is mostly set in the 1930's you feel like you are actually in Big Boomer America. The accuracy of this story is so good and I applaud the author. From the slang to the clothing you feel like you entered a time machine.\n          The settings is in the Big Apple mostly, that's right, New York. Particularly in the tough ol' Manhattan swarming with mobsters. The characters match their time period. Their is not a wild hair color or clothing that is too Pilgrim to be of the 1930's. The colors of the backgrounds really shout to you and come to life. The biggest masterpiece in this anime though is the train, The Flying Pussyfoot. It is detailed greatly and accurately. \n        However you can't have a good anime set in the 1930's in the Big Apple without some killer jazz to set the mood. The soundtrack is what will win your heart. The upbeat theme song followed by nice blues and jazz ballads playing in the background gives this anime a sitcom feeling. For the dub fans the dub is wonderfully so don't worry. The accents are amazing and you feel like you are watching actual Italian  and Russian mobsters. I did not watch this in sub, but people who have said the sub version was nice as well so for sub fans you will just have to give it a shot. On the other hand the ending theme song is the only thing that is flawed. It's not that it's bad, but it just doesn't fit the mood of the anime, too Japanese. \n            This anime is not just equipped with a killer soundtrack, but it has a big cast of great characters. There are too many to list and no of them is the main character,it's more like they all are main characters. Still two characters still shine farther than the rest and that is Isaac and Miria, the wacko thieves that bring comedy and kindness to the tough world of Baccano. The main flaw in this anime lies in the characters. While the characters aren't bad and are very unique and and have few cliches about them you feel as if the anime leaves you hanging. You fall in love with the characters and with 13 episodes it's not enough to get to know some of them like you would like.\n           Overall, loved this anime and I did enjoy it. If you are looking for a change in pace in anime watch Baccano.Also this anime is good if you are thinking of finally venturing in the historical anime genre. Give it a shot and I bet you won't be sorry."},

I wish it could have been longer that 16 episodes thought... Anyway this series is crazy fantasy caper involving alchemists, immortals, gangsters, outlaws and an elixir of immortality, spread over several decades. This all happens  in three diferent scenarios at the same time, forming an overaching story arc. And all this comes together giving us Baccano!. \nSTORY 9/10\n The story is confusing, at first. The first episode gives us the ending of the series. Slowly, we learn what brought our characters to the position presented in the first episode. This\n          \n        is actually brilliant, in my opinion. They execute it very well. \nART 8/10\n This looks very good for an anime released in 2007. The colors are crisp and bright. The animation is fluid and seamless. The characters can be distinguished easily. The blood isn't censored in any way. In short, the art is very good.\nSOUND 9/10\n The OST is outstanding. The OP is freaking great. Really gets you excited for the episode. It resembles Durarara's OP. It shows you the characters, a recap and a good musical melody that includes trumpets and a very jazzy vibe that goes well with the setting of the series. Both the sub and dub are very good. I personally recommend the dub since the series in set in in America. \nCHARACTERS 8/10\n The characters hold Baccano together. Some of them are utterly brilliant (looking at you Miria and Isaac) and others seem good but are under-developed. The cast is diverse and no two characters are the same. This diverse ensemble of characters include: the two thieves, a psychotic assassin, bunch of inmortals, the mafia, terrorists... Hijinks ensue.\nOVERALL 9/10\n I enjoyed Baccano, a lot. The story, the characters and sound are very good. I did not waste my time watching this series. If you want a good crime, fantasy anime, this is your cup of tea.\n\n"},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    This anime is one heck of a puzzle! That’s what I can say.\nSet in the western part of the world particularly in USA around 1930-1932, This anime revolves around themes of robbery, assassination and a slight world of mafia.\nI thought that this was another Lupin III or Cowboy Beepop style of anime because their OP themes are somewhat similar. And Yes, they are a bit similar, but Baccano! still brings out its own originality. \nOne notable factor of this anime is that they are able to show the different point of view of each character in a particular scene and that’s why there are recurring\n          \n        events. To put it simply, the characters are in the same time line, but it shows each character’s view in that particular span of time. ( Example: The scene right now is that you are reading this review. Later it will show what your mom’s doing during time that you are reading this review.)\nWhy did I describe it as a puzzle? It’s because if the anime Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya has jumbled episodes, this time Baccano! has jumbled scenes.  It is a bit confusing because for example, if at first they are at the 1931, later they will jump at 1930 and then to 1932 and back to 1931 again. The way they switch the scenes from present to past don’t seem like a flash back or a character reminiscing a past event at all, but rather each character’s view point in that particular time, and I guess this is also one notable factor of this anime. \nSince it involves mafia, assassination and killings expect it to be bloody as that of Elfen Lied. Aside from Mafia, assassination and robbery,  it also involves alchemy in it. Alchemy in the sense that there are characters who are immortal. I’m not gonna spill who or how they became immortal because you should find that out yourself.  There’s also a slight dash of comedy, but it sometimes is a bit annoying. Perhaps  another  thing that keeps this anime going is the mystery behind immortality since you ought to piece together all the scenes to be able to grasp their connections , and  thus making you chase the episodes until the end.\nAll in all, Baccano! is one entertaining puzzle to piece together."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I was never really interested in watching it at first, people said \"It takesplace in America, mafia days.... It's pretty cool.\" So I was like \"Mafia? What? No thanks.\" I don't remember what got me watching it, but I am SO glad I did. It's everything opposite of what I expected it to be\nStory: 10/10\nDuring the late 1930s in Chicago, the transcontinental train, Flying Pussyfoot, is starting its legendary journey that will leave a trail of blood all over the country. At the same time in New York, the ambitious scientist Szilard and his unwilling aide Ennis, are looking for missing bottles of the immortality\n          \n        elixir. In addition, a war between the mafia groups is getting worse. On board the Advena Avis, in 1711, alchemists are about to learn the price of immortality.\nBased on the award winning light novels of the same name, this anime adaptation follows several events that initially seem unrelated, both in time and place, but are part of a much bigger story - one of alchemy, survival and immortality. Merging these events together are the kindhearted would-be thieves, Isaac and Miria, connecting various people, all of them with their own hidden ambitions and agendas, and creating lifelong bonds and consequences for everyone involved.\n--\nOk. I loved the story line but the way it was told made it even MORE interesting. It skipped between years, so you'd have to pay extra attention. Usually you could tell what year it was by the outfits Miria and Isaac were wearing, or if they were on the train or not. \nThe show has gore. And lots of it. From fingers being sliced off, to a kid's head being shot off, to people getting grated by the train tracks. Some of it made me look away, but since I'm pretty much used to stuff like that, I found it pretty cool. It's violently funny, in the exact sense. You have Miria and Isaac's antics, which will never cease to crack you up, and Claire's violent nature, which will have you cringing as the blood spills. \nI'm not really all the fond of Mafia war movies and stuff, but adding immortals into it made it OH SO ENJOYABLE. Without the immortals, no one would have survived to tell the story, leaving Carol to be all the more confused, and the series shortened to one single episode. \nEveryone would have bled to death. \nArt: 10/10\nWhat I loved about this style of art, what how GRAPHIC it was. When some one's face is being grated off, they show everything. It's not your typical cutesy or realistic art, its perfect for the time setting and area. The people are proportioned right, nothing looks ODD, and the colors aren't so vibrant, so it feels 1930ish. \nSound: 8/10\nThis show, if you like authentic, is best watched in the English dub, where you can hear the 1930's Chicago accents, and be amazed. The Japanese original doesn't have the accent, so we're missing out on it. I'm not saying the original Japanese was bad or anything, I actually prefer it, but some people beg to differ. Both cast choices were great, and fit each character well. The music is great too, fitting the time period with 1930's sounding BGM and a good opening song. The only thing I had a problem with is the uber slow ending song. I feel it didn't fit in with the rest of the show/music. \nCharacter: 10/10\nI think the reason why thoroughly enjoyed this was the extreme variety in characters. My favorite changed with each episode (until Claire came in and then he remained, until I watched the OVA), because each and every character has such huge personalities. You cant like Miria without liking Isaac, and vice versa. They come as a pair, making the show seriously hilarious with their stupidity. All the immortals are likable, expect for a few, which are made to be hated/disliked. Then there's Ladd and Claire, both of them love killing people, and do it often. Ladd does it for fun, Claire does it for some sort of insane justice. \nYou cant really spot any character development, because the years skip around so much, its hard to tell. Jacuzzi still cries, so nothing for him. But, even with the lack of development, the story moves smoothly, getting its point across.\nOverall Enjoyment: 10/10\nLike I said before, I was not expecting to like this anime at all, yet it reached its spot in my favorites. The blood, humor and each character made me fall in love with it, and I would watch it over and over again if I could. If you're a fan of Series' like Higurashi, Umineko, & Elfen Lied like me, then this is the series for you. It is twice as gory as Umineko, which I didn't think was possible, and I was even flinching during some scenes, especially the ones with Czes. I loved it, and I expect a lot of you will too.\n        "},

I'll also be reviewing all 16 episodes of Baccano! including the specials. \nStory - 33/35 - Highly Enjoyable. The beginning is a confusing mess but after Episode 3 everything starts to make sense and you will be hooked. There is three stories getting told all at once. That is what makes this already enjoyable story all the more enjoyable. The problem with the story and why it doesn't get a perfect score is because the first three episodes might be a chore to go through and the\n          \n        last three episodes (the specials) are not as good as the \"main story.\" The setting of the show just fits, and the show does a good job of welding the fantasy aspect with the time period. What I mean is, none of the fantasy (immortals, people blocking bullets, etc.) feels out of place. It is a light novel that is still going on, so the ending isn't totally complete, but the show does such a good job at wrapping it up I would feel bad giving it a lower score. Also, the setting of this show just fits. \nCharacters 34/35 - You will not find a more entertaining cast of characters. Every single one of them are good, and there are about 18 \"main\" characters. That also tells you how good the story is for fitting all these events and characters into 16 episodes and NOT making it feel like a clusterfuck. The characters also fit the setting very well, and feel like 1930's America. Some characters are more important than others, but that's mostly because the story isn't finished. A few characters get roles later on in the novels. That is the only thing keeping it from a perfect score. \nOn a side note the Dub of this show is absolutely amazing. Dubbed is the best way to watch this show. It takes place in America (New York specifically), so you NEED to watch the Dub to appreciate the characters with their accents and whatnot. \nMusic - 14/15 - One of the best scores ever, in my opinion. The opening perfectly encompasses this show, and is one of the best openings I have ever seen. The rest of the score is great, and just fits with the overall theme and setting very well. Perfect musical choice. The ending is not amazing, but not something you'll skip. \nAnimation - 12/15 Not bad, but not anything to write home about. Good enough would be the best words to describe it. It doesn't take away from the show, but it doesn't add much either. It does gain some points for character designs though. I admit I'm a little biased because animation doesn't really matter to me so long as it isn't noticeably bad, which this isn't. \nOverall - 93/100 - This is my favorite show ever, and it deserves the score it got. Nothing is perfect, which is why it doesn't have a perfect score, but trust me, it's pretty damn close. Go watch it now. \n"},

I wasn't expecting to much from it, cause I had never heard about it, and that's how I get new series (By recommendation); but the serie really got me.\nFor a second, imagine an Anime directed and thought by Quentin Tarantino. From the story line, to the great characters creation, this anime is splendidly well done. It took me by surprise the similarity between its soundtrack and the cool bebop jazz from Cowboy Bebop. The bunch of characters allows you to get familiarized with at least one of them.\nAs something coming out, apparently, of the mind of\n          \n        somebody like Quentin, this Anime has it all: a great history, with inner histories that mix with others and gives you a good idea of the personality of all characters and their relationship; it has blood, a lot of that (something that you could not miss in a Tarantino movie); it has comedy, a good peace of it thanks to the main couple Isaac and Miria; it has a supernatural argument, based on alchemy, wich is one of my favorites branches in the supernatural; the design of the characters ambiented in the 90s is just wonderful, as well as its art; and for the last but not less important, it has a time line that is not continuous, wich makes the history very interesting and dynamic, with random flashes to the past and future, jumping in time, trying to put the pieces of the history together. \nEven though that the serie is a little bit short (13 episodes without the ovas), it's a great anime, 100% recommended before die. \n        "},

The only complaint I have ever heard about it was that the first episode confused some people. Me being a huge fan of Pulp Fiction, embraced the style of storytelling, as it really brings out the good qualities of this type of story. \nAlso, this is probably one of the only anime where the English dub is better than the original Japanese cast. Maybe its that the story takes place in America, I don't know. \nThe music is wonderful with an upbeat opening song\n          \n        introducing all the characters, and the ending theme is a beautiful slow ballad. Just to let you know, the guy who did Ladd Russo's English voice was amazing, he is perfect for psychotic killers\nThere are about 15-20 main characters as well and all of them have a history, and a goal. it really is a work of art how the author threaded all of these stories together in 13 episodes (and a 3 ep OVA)\nAll in all, this is one of my top 5 favorite anime's of all time, and if anyone actually watched all 13 episodes and still didn't enjoy it, The only excuse I can think of is that they just aren't smart enough to do anything other than be a wannabe critique \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Baccano! is an anime that's indeed larger than life. the characters are well made, the plot is very much unique and i have to say that there is no dull moment in watching it.\nthe first episode will eventually confuse the viewers due to the extensive cast that's almost immediately shoved down their throats and the shifts from one timeline to another (1930, 1931, 1932) would sprout more questions than answers yet, as the story progress, characters are fleshed out in their color, their roles are defined well and their interaction with one another is emphasized. As anime with a huge cast that has relationships with\n          \n        one another IS hard to do, it was surprising how Baccano! managed to pull it off. \nthe jazzy music of the anime especially the intro Guns and Roses by Paradise Lunch fits the 1930's setting of the story.\noverall, with the extensive cast, sequencing of scenes, great story (if you can follow the story's pace that is), Baccano would be a good treat for you.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    At first sight, Baccano seems to be a poorly put together, try-hard, wannabe anime. It is difficult to to tell what is going on at first: who did what? what happened to who? and what is going on??? are all questions I asked. But after four or five episodes, the plot emerged from the dense and anachronic vignettes. The series itself is very satisfying at the end, the main questions have been answered, and things generally seem to work out. And if that isn't enough for you, there three more episodes to satiate yourself even further. \nStory - 8: While it can be difficult to\n          \n        follow at times, the plot of Baccano is all in all great. It focuses on the early 1930s in the US with only a few divergences. Within each episode there may be six or seven different scenes each following different characters. While the story perhaps isn't told as masterfully as Kurt Vonnegut or Quentin Tarantino, it certainly holds its own. As it could be guessed, the plot is primarily character driven, with the events serving as rationales for their behavior. The story also seemed to get more and more captivating with each episode; the more that was revealed, the more intriguing each of the plots became. \nArt - 10: The art in this series is amazing; never does it decrease in quality or change in style. The faces of the characters are varied and thankfully they do not suffer from sfs. The characters look very realistic without compromising the integrity of the art. Nothing is over-produced or awkward looking as can happen in seinen manga and anime. I was struck in particular at the animation of liquids which seemed very naturalistic to me. The whole series is very artistically designed, reflecting the format it was originally published in. \nSound - 7: Unlike the art, the sound is nothing special. The music and sound effects work just fine along with the art and story. \nCharacters - 9: This is another aspect of Baccano that sets it aside from other works. While each of the characters are shown only to have a few character traits, the author is able to bring them alive, such that by the end, you are rooting for everyone. The backstories for most of the characters are not explored in depth, however despite this, it is easy to relate to many of the characters. I myself am a little confused as to why these characters in particular are so sympathetic. Each of the characters are nonetheless given endings that are satisfying, save one. I still don't know what happened to Lua. In spite of this, the series still is very good.\nEnjoyment - 9: The series seems to exist for this purpose, enjoyment of a story involving many unique characters in a time when most of us can't remember. The enjoyment of the series can be likened to a fine glass of wine after a hard, but satisfying day at work. All of the elements contribute the the enjoyment of the series but particularly the art and characters. \nOverall -9: Despite some of the shortcomings of the series such as having to watch at least four or five episodes to grasp what's going on, and a few untied ends. It nevertheless is an great series that I recommend to all who are interested.\nHere are some extra scores for detail:\ngore: 8 - a lot of bloodshed and body horror\nsadness: 5 - it's not a particularly sad series, but neither is it happy\nThe Feel Good™: 4 - Its more satisfying than Feel Good™\nAddictivity: 6.5 - As it progresses it becomes more addictive but at the beginning its unlikely you would want to watch more than one or two episodes a day. \nMisogyny: 3 - Not a lot of fan-service or blatant sexism. The women are varied and have their own personalities. There are some undertones due to it being set in the 1930s.\n        "},

That might just be because i'm a bit dense though.\nAll around, you're looking at a pretty good show, the characters are somehow diverse yet all very similar in the sense that they are all fun and enjoyable. I have no idea whats going on with the plot, there are like 5 different points in time that the story follows simultaneously and it wasn't until episode 7 that i figured out that what happened when.\nDon't get me wrong, its not like this show is\n          \n        'Donnie Darko ^ Inception * the Lord of the Rings on acid', its just that if you are like me, and you picked it up because the name made you giggle like a school girl then you have no hope. Then again, the opening straightened more things out for me than the synopsis did so maybe I need to get more sleep.\nSpeaking of the Opening. It makes me giddy every time i hear it. I feel as if it portrays the characters perfectly while the music is just on point for the time that this show is set in, even if I was clueless as to what was going on, the opening would come along once every now and then and tell me: \n\"Its OK, look, we even put the characters names in big letters for you\"\nFinal thoughts, you will like this one if you are into the Al Capone era of america, you also have a few bad-asses who can swing knives pretty well.\nOh and also, the Kid is a snarky little pr*ck and i LOVE it.\n        "},

And, I say that as someone who had no idea what the hell was going on during my first viewing. Maybe, I shouldn't have watched the first episode while I was on the verge of falling asleep, or maybe it's one of those pieces of media that are naturally incomprehensible on the first viewing, or maybe I'm just dumb. \nDespite not quite getting the plot, I watched the show all the way through. Cause even though I wasn't quite sure what these characters were doing, I knew that I liked them. I liked this super-kicking homunculus with a mean\n          \n        daddy. I liked the skipping psychopath on the train. I really liked the dimwitted robber couple.\nI also liked the music, the solid animation, and the fact that this show took place during prohibition, and the English dub had everyone sounding like it.\nSo, I watched the dub again. Everything great the first time was great the second time, but now, the plot made sense! A character I forgot from my first viewing became one of my all-time favorites. Isaac and Miria were still adorable.\nBaccano! is just one of those shows that makes me feel good watching it. Even(especially?) when Ladd is working his magic.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Baccano is a really special anime and just the opening song is good enough to give me the feeling that this will be a good anime. Especially with the mafia plot , it makes me like this anime even more. It gives the kind of adult kind of feeling tv show (very mature type) . At the same time , it is very interesting and fun to watch because the story slowly unravels to become even more and more confusing and makes viewers rush for the next epsiode and next episode to find out what the actual f*** is going on ... Well , for\n          \n        me , i came to myanimelist at first and found out that this anime is 8.54 ratings. I was convinced it is going to be a good anime . But as i watched , it is really confusing for me at the start because i am not used to repeated scenes from anime and many times i have to make sure that i was on the right episode because they just keep repeat to certain scenes i have already seen. With the mindset of 8.54 rating , i kept on watching anddddd realize why it was 8.54. IT was truly good . EVEN though it can be confusing abit , your mind eventually solve all the episodes mystery and like a puzzle you solve . You will just know what is going on as you watch on and on . Everything THEN makes sense. The opening song is a really unique type of song and very catchy. Probably , listening to the catchy opening song gives one the feel to watch baccano xd The ending song also great , very emotional xd. The story is just probably about fighting and fighting... (mafia fights) I was expecting like loyalty touching story between brothers but nope. Even though is just killing , fights but there are some sad moments for the villains as well. There are also jokers lighten the entire mafia serious atmosphere which makes them so interesting to watch as well xD \nSo basically : Story :\nSerious with fun and cute ----->> Very dark very serious ----->> Sad and happy endings and left story unfinished for some characters (finale) But was satisfied with ending xd\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I enjoyed Durarara a lot so I decided to try out Baccano (the light novels of Baccano and Durarara were written by the same guy for those of you who don't know). I was blown away. I didn't really know what to expect going in - the synopsis makes it sound a little out there. Like Durarara, Baccano has a complex plot that is woven together throughout each episode. The first episode leaves you absolutely confused with no idea what's going on. Do not let this discourage you. It basically shows you the end of the show then goes back and explains all the events\n          \n        leading up to the end. The way they told the story is very unique and absolutely fantastic.\nSTORY - 10\nThe story was fantastic. It starts out confusing, but each episode builds up on the next and all of the mysteries are unraveled (though, I would recommend watching the specials as it ties up all the loose ends and gives more back story to some of the characters). I love genres that have mafia and hitmen set in the 20's and 30's so that was a lovely surprise. The storytelling is one of my favorite things about this series. The author is a genius.\nArt - 10\nI loved the art. Jacuzzi's and Isaac's designs in particular I really loved. I don't really have much to say about the art and animation other than both were fantastic. It has a unique style and doesn't follow the standard anime style which I liked.\nSound - 10\nNot much to say here. The sound effects were great, the voices AMAZING (I watch everything in subs). I was surprised when I realized who the voice actor for Claire Steinfield was. The first thing that comes to mind is Haizaki Shougo from Kuroko no Basuke. The two voices could not said any different, but it's the same guy. The voice actors of Ladd Russo and Isaac stood out to me in particular, but all the voices were great. I should probably mention the music too . . . ah nothing much to say either...I liked it. It fit in well with the 30s feel. \nCharacter - 10\nOne thing about Baccano . . . probably over 3/4 of the characters are insane or have some psychotic killer hidden inside them. But you know what? It works. One of my favorite characters, Ladd Russo, is an absolute maniac, but he's great. Isaac and Miria provide most of the comedic relief in the show making them my favorites. Another thing about this show is that there is no main character. Again, it works. The storyline is about a wide collection of characters and how they all tie together. Very rarely used in storytelling, but it's another of my favorite things about this show. All the characters are so interesting, especially the psychotic ones.\nEnjoyment - 10\nI was hooked on this right away. Like I mentioned earlier, I love genres set in the 20s and 30s with mafias and gangsters. The supernatural elements didn't hurt the story, but made it great. The characters were fantastic, the storytelling phenomenal. Just a random sidenote, this show had no fan service which immediately made me so happy. No adays it seems that the anime industry thinks adding in fan service makes an anime popular. I. Hate. Fan service. It kills plot. Baccano focuses on story and character development and does it so well. So anyway...fantastic anime. One of my favorites.\nOverall - 10 \n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    With all of its characters, it's really hard to tell who's who in 'Baccano'. But I did discern some of my favorites. \nSince this show is very character heavy, I decided to focus on my favorite characters.\nLet's touch upon the plot very quickly before we start, though.\nThe plot was, simply, confusing.\n\nThere was so much going on. I think I can figure out a vague timeline, but the jumps between 1931 and 1932 were so rushed and confusing. I could write it out and try to understand it, but, for this anime, it doesn't seem worth the effort. The only part of the plot I\n          \n        really understand is the 1700s event with the demon. Beyond that, though, it's a muddled mess.\nSo back to the characters. Here are my top five 'Baccano' characters:\n1) Issac and Miria\n\nOkay. I'm cheating here, but these two are inseparable. \nI love them because they're the comedy. These two are the only characters I can make sense of. They are, as seen in the OP, pure comedy.\n\nThey rob candy stores. They steal doors. They dress up as whacky characters.\n\nBut out of everything, they are the characters who really are interesting. They're weird, but I wonder why so. I'm interested in these two out of all the other couples/characters in this show. And that's what makes them great.\nAlso, I need to remind you that these two are pretty smart. They might seem airheaded or ditzy at first, but they help Eve reconcile with her pain and help Czeslaw embrace trust again. That's amazing.\n2) Jacuzzi\n\nOut of all the characters, Jacuzzi is the only one who seems to change throughout the entire anime. He starts out as this crybaby who seems to need Nice a lot.\n\nMore often than not, he's crying his eyes out. But as we near the end of the anime, you get to see something in him. He cries for a reason. And you kinda respect him for that. He's way stronger than you think, and he is willing to do anything to protect those he loves. I really do admire that. And his character change was, really, a curveball for me. I would have never seen it coming.\n3) Firo\n\nOut of all the 'Baccano' characters, Firo has to be the nicest. In his initiation, the head of the group does ask him if he'd like to pull back because he's so good. And I have to agree. Firo is such a nice guy. You'd never think he's in with the mafia families. \nHe wields a blade like a boss, but what I love most is that he treasures his hat. I love that, and it's so funny that he holds onto it while fighting.\n\n4) Czeslaw\n\nAt first, you think he's innocent. Then, he comes out blazing with anger. Which I think is pretty interesting. Czeslaw is this complicated character. I think he deserves much more screen time. \nHe went through so much pain. I hurt for him. His story is so sad. And I'm kinda upset we didn't get more of this. It would have been really interesting if we had more of him.\n\n5) Rachel\n\nRachel deserves more credit. She snuck onto the train. And fought back against so many people. And she only had a leg injury. How does her body work? She's so amazing.\n\nAnd she puts herself out of the way (As an informant) to rescue so many people. She put herself in danger to help. I loved that. She was so brave. \nAnd she's, somehow, just a side character? I don't get that.\nWho is your favorite 'Baccano' character? Why? And what are you overall thoughts on 'Baccano'?\n        "},

If you don't like stories like Pulp Fiction that focus on different characters and the plot jumps back and forward in time, then perhaps Baccano! is not the anime for you.\nIf you're not interested in watching a story from the villain's perspective then perhaps you should also avoid Baccano! Many of the characters are interesting, but most are also villainous or at least morally ambiguous. I personally find it fascinating to see a story from the point of view of characters with unconventional morals.\nIt was overall very enjoyable\n          \n        for me and I liked the \"open\" ending (even if it's not most people's cup of tea). \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    Overview:\n\"Baccano\" is one of those shows that, at first glance, you wouldn't think came out of Japan- a film noir-esque gangster flick set in an alternate version of 1930s America, with various hints of the supernatural thrown in for good measure. With an ensemble cast, great voice acting and highly entertaining comedy and fight scenes, \"Baccano\" manages to be a very fun ride (no pun intended) despite being more than a bit on the short side.\nStory & World (7.5/10):\n\"Baccano\" story revolves around the lives of various characters, including alchemists, thieves, thugs, American Mafia and Italian Mafia. Oh, and immortals. From a flashback episode, we learn\n          \n        that a bunch of people were granted immortality by a mysterious demon back in 1711. Naturally, many of these characters are still alive in the 1930s and one crazy scientist is trying to recreate the elixir. However, that's just one small fraction of the plot. And there's a lot of plot.\nOne of the first things you learn about \"Baccano\" is that nobody is the main character. The story is constantly switching points of view, frequently every few minutes, which slowly but surely pieces together a very complicated story. Much of this takes place on a train called the 'Flying Pussyfoot', which many of the major characters have conveniently boarded. Chaos ensues, bullets go flying and people are killed. It could pretty much be argued that the entire story revolves around the train, with everything else showing the events that lead up to it. The story is not told in a straight line, however, as the constant point-of-view switching goes into the past just as often as the future.\nUnfortunately, the story is let down by the anime's very short length. In total, there are only 16 episodes, with 13 being the main story and the remaining 3 serving as an epilogue of sorts. This makes the overall story come off as very rushed with little to no build-up. Furthermore, the multiple points of view make it difficult to keep track of everything within such a short amount of time. While the story is definitely unique and exciting, it is also an unfortunate case of ending too quickly and leaving you wanting more. \nArt & Animation (7.5/10):\n\"Baccano\"'s animation is pretty average. It looks fine for the most part but it's ultimately pretty rough around the edges, even considering the fact that it came out in 2007. This is especially shown during scenes that are zoomed out, in which the characters' faces are completely blank and have no visible features. Considering this wasn't the case with several anime that came out in the early 2000s, this comes off as very jarring. It's pretty obvious that they didn't have a particularly big animation budget.\nSound & Dialogue (8.5/10):\nThe musical score is, for the most part, pretty good. While not many of the tracks are particularly noteworthy, it still really fits the setting and tone of the show. Special mention goes to \"Calling\", a hauntingly beautiful track that serves as the ending theme. The voice acting is fantastic, specifically the dub. Ask any fan of the series, and they will say the dub is the right way to go here, especially considering the series takes place in America. A lot of my favourite voice actors are here, including Colleen Clinkenbeard, Todd Haberkorn, Brina Palencia and Monica Rial, who provide the voices of Nice, Firo, Ennis and Chane respectively. Add in a decent, witty script and this is undoubtedly one of the show's greatest strengths.\nCharacters (7.5/10):\nThe cast of characters is impressively diverse. The opening even goes through the trouble of showing the names of nearly all the major characters, with the ending theme following suit by merely showing their faces. Unfortunately, the dozens of characters proves to be a problem. As I mentioned before, the series tries to ram an awful lot into only 16 episodes, which is not a good thing when you have dozens of characters. As a result of this, only a few of the characters ever get the recognition they deserve.\nIt's a real shame, because the characters who do get the recognition they deserve are great. My favourite has got to be Claire Stanfield, also known as Vino, the world's greatest assassin. Not only is he an absolute badass, but he's also pleasingly complex. He may be an assassin who works with criminals, but he does so in order to kill other criminals. He also has a code to never harm innocent people and in fact despises people who kill for the hell of it. This doesn't mean he can't enjoy his work, though, and he employs countless methods of torture to get the job done. It's ironic that one of the most brutal characters in the series is also one of the most heroic. Additionally, he's actually a pretty affable guy when not on the job, making you wonder if he's really a psychopath or if he just puts an act on to function better as an assassin.\nAnother notable character is Ennis, a homunculus who was created as an emotionless puppet by a mad scientist and has a few similarities to Irisviel von Einzbern. She is kept as a slave and abused by her creator, who forces her to obey his every command with the fact that he can kill her with a single thought. Therefore, she has to all sorts of horrible things against her will and there's nothing she can do about it. It's pretty heartbreaking to see what she goes through, as she learns human emotions and tries to cope with horrors of what she's doing.\nThere's a bunch of other interesting characters as well, including Nice, a scarred girl who's enthusiastic about bombs, Chane, a mute girl who dual-wields knives and Ladd, an unstable mobster who detests the arrogant and takes great glee at killing anyone who least expects him to. And, of course, who could forget fan-favourites Isaac and Miria, a duo of hilariously dim-witted thieves who go around spreading inspiration to others without even trying. Additionally, without giving anything away, you find one of the biggest badasses in the series in the last possible character you would expect.\nEnjoyment (8.5/10):\n\"Baccano\" is a very entertaining series from start to finish, with plenty of hilarious comedy and great action scenes. And really, what's there not to enjoy about a noir crime series in which characters slowly cross paths with one another? It is rather confusing for the first six episodes, as it's only until the seventh episode that things finally start to come together and make sense, but if you're patient you will be rewarded.\nOverall:\n\"Baccano\" is a great series that unfortunately feels like it's over far too quickly. The animation is pretty limited and I really think it could have done with 8 or 10 more episodes just to expand on quite a few things, but thankfully this doesn't take away from the enjoyment too much. It's also unlike almost any other anime out there, that alone makes it worth checking out.\nScore:\n7.5+7.5+8.5+7.5+8.5=39.5/50=7.9/10\n        "},

The plot is blended with intriguing questions of life and gives you an intellectual orgasm. It ties in alchemy, who doesn't love alchemy, and focuses on an elixir of immortality. At first, the story is a bit confusing yet at one point all the pieces come together and leave you awestruck. The shortness of the show is the only negative attribute; it leaves you wanting for much more compared to the regular feeling of \" Does Naruto becomes Hokage\" because thats all i care about after watching a show\n          \n        done like Naruto.

Mostly the characters ruled over everything because I guess they were the main point. This show had a lesson I loved mixed into it, be the main character in your life. Well go on be it. In any case it's done out of chronology and sometimes that becomes frustrating but it also builds a up good tension so it's an interesting device to ponder.

There's never a dull moment in baccano, and every episode is like a piece of a big puzzle that comes slowly together to make a clear picture at the end. \nAnother thing I love is how every character is richly developed with their own little secrets and plot twisting around them, making it as such as there is no \"supporting\" cast per se--as everyone has their own unique side of the story to tell.\nI'm giving it a 10! It's one of those animes that can just make you\n          \n        laugh, cry, that brings a slight tinge of fear and huge amounts of fun and suspense, sometimes all in just one episode! \n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Ah what to say what to say. Baccano, my dear friend. Your end will not be forgotten, and your beginning shall be treasured forever.\nImagine a storyline that's pretty darn entertaining to watch. It's well developed and so are the characters in it. Now imagine 3 storylines told in such a way that even if they were boring, the way its told is fascinatingly entertaining. Throw in a wide range of humor that will appeal to everyone in at least one point of the series and you got Baccano.\nNow, \"thrown in\" is a bad word for how this masterpiece was constructed and probably shouldn't ever be\n          \n        associated with Baccano. If you'll humor me with my analogies, it's like a fashion designer purposefully looking a little ragged because it's fashionable.\nWell time to get to the nitty gritty of all... this:\nThe Storyline(s) + Characters:\nI've put these 2 together for a reason.\nNot going to lie, the storyline is not the absolute best I've ever seen, but it's somewhat original and the characters that tell it definitely make up for some of the iffy parts. This is where spoilers usually appear so I'll try to shut my mouth. You just got to know that it's all scrambled up and you'll think it's confusing. But it's not. Because you're able to associate your favorite characters to each of the storylines and remember exactly who they and what they're like. Even though there's a lot going on, there's a lot of characters to. And I guarantee you'll have your own opinion on each of the characters and also know exactly who they are.  They breath which makes the story come alive and seem as if it might of actually happened. Add in the fact that they can joke a bit but still not lose the seriousness needed for some of the scenes and you've got yourself a damn near perfect set of troopers ready to entertain.\n8/10 for the story\n10/10 (if I could give it 11 I would) for the characters\nArt:\nThis is my sweet spot. I personally love this style, because it seems so fluid and works with just about every setting. It's an over exaggeration of certain features, but not too much to the point of ridiculousness. The art puts emphasis where its needed. It has a little randomness, but not to the extent where it'll annoy you. Plus the physics are amazing. \n10/10 sir, you've done well\nSound:\nIt is rare that I get the sound track for an anime. Maybe its because I like classic american mob music, or maybe I'm able to envision the scenes where the songs where played. I don't know. Either way, no better suited for this type of setting.\n10/10, if you like this setting you'll like the sound track that goes with it\nOverall:\nWould recommend it to anyone who knows what a good anime is (and even those who don't). Only thing I could possibly complain about is that after I saw this it took 2 or 3 weeks for me to watch other animes, because they all seemed under par from then on out.\nOh btw, if you're still not sure you should go on youtube and watch \"Baccano Swing\". That's what made me want to watch Baccano :)\n\n\nPeace"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    Over the past few months, I have watched many good anime, but none of which I would consider fantastic or that would be a contender for one my all time favourites. But then I watched Baccono! and it has been the exact anime I've been looking for all summer; absolute entertainment that sets it apart from anything i had ever seen before.\nBaccono! takes place on the train The Flying Pussyfoot, which comes attack and has many people fighting for their lives against armed terrorists and a mythical monster. Also it’s about two mafia families at war with each other. And a little girl searching for\n          \n        the whereabouts of her brother. And a group of alchemists trying to secure the secret of immortality. And each of these stories take place in a different time zone told at the same time as each other. Plus the fact it’s not told in a chronological, linear fashion, with the end at the beginning, and the middle all messed up makes it both unique and confusing. But it managed something I wouldn't have thought possible, all of the times zones ended up connected in a way that everything makes sense by the final episode.\nThe anime doesn’t really focus on one single main character throughout its 13 episodes, but instead it switches constantly from the gangsters to the alchemists; to the passengers of The Flying Pussyfoot and the psychotic killers. It would be impossible to list them all but a worthy mention has to go to Issac and Miria for being two of the most likeable characters as well as being some of the best comic relief I have ever seen. \nHowever one problem with this unique style is that in the first half, you are just gonna be extremely confused. It will be hard to keep track of characters names or what gangster family they are part of, or who is immortal or not. But at the end it doesn't really matter, as it does become clear. \nNow the majority of this anime is set in 1930's New York, so I would recommend watching the English dub. Not only is it very good, but it created the feeling that I was watching a gangster drama, rather than an anime. So in a way it's like Cowboy Bebop as they is barely a trace of anything remotely Japanese. Plus the opening is not a standard J-Pop affair but is really jazzy., which suits the setting perfectly.\nUltimately the reason why I love this anime is that manages to make everything work, from its bad ass actions, to its different setting: to the psychotic characters to the whiny, insecure ones. Everyone and everything develops really well and I just love the combination of action with plenty of gore, drama and comedy, and even some mild horror and romance. They all come together and form a fantastic anime. This is definitely an anime that I will not only watch again soon but also deserves its official release purchased as soon as possible.\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    This is probably one of the best animes that has ever been produced, period! \nAnd yes, that is quite a claim, but let's really dive into why I personally think so.\nIn the moment of writing I really have just begun to get into anime at all, but just because I may not have seen all the episodes of One Piece or Naruto doesn't mean I never seen movies or series at all before. \nAnd I think that Baccano! really is a outstanding achievement simply because it managed to completely sucker-punch me into the entire anime genre. \nWith it's plot being mostly set in 1930s America\n          \n        it already has a good start with non-anime viewers. The setting is simple enough that a normal viewer can wrap their heads around it without a second thought. And since the premise of the story is set as supernatural this is very good. \nSince I don't want to spoil the series going into the plot is very hard, but if pressured I would say that the plot is centred around 3 main plots that all are intertwined in one way or another. Showing us what happens aboard the Flying Pussyfoot express, a Mafia family war in New York and the experiments of a power hungry, if not mad, scientist. \nThe story is very unique and is very nicely varied, so it doesn't drag on and on about one topic and one topic only that many series often have.\nThe way the story is told bears an  uncanny resemblance to the non-linear storytelling in the movie Pulp Fiction, jumping between different characters in different places in different times and really needs the viewer to pay attention to what happens and what is being said. \nThis way of storytelling can be a problem in some cases, it can make some viewers fell confused and can be very annoying when at certain points the story simply throws it's hands up and says \"Oh well, let's get back to this in a later episode, shall we?\" But to me personally that was a great decision, holding out the suspense and making me watch the next episode to get the answer. Making this a really addictive show. \nWatching all episodes are quite essential, since only by watching it until the end will really answer all the questions one has, or most of them at least. \nThe characters are all entertaining and colourful in their own way, some of them are instantly likeable to some people and some are not, but most likely they will all grow on you and in the end entertain you as much as you would never expect.\nSince this series boasts such a large cast of main characters one would think that 13 episodes are barely enough to give all of them all enough of the limelight, but since the story is non-linear, the characters all get to shine.\nAnd not to mention that this series boasts two characters that are simply impossible to dislike, a dynamic duo of two thieves that really make up for most of the comedy of the show and just leaves one with an impression that the two of them could even have their own show since they really are just that funny. \nBut let's not forget that there are even limits to their comedy, everything in small doses. \nThe animation is simply beautify if not perfect, pretty much all the characters are uniquely drawn and stand out. The Series is shot with a kind of negative grain filter that is superposed to play into the fact that this is recorded in the 1930s, may be annoying to some, but I implore you to try and look past it.\nOther then that I don't know what to say, the series does not suffer any hiccups in the animations and the animation really stands out against other anime. \nThe music is near perfect, having the exactly right music at the right moments and also staying true to the music of the time period it is supposed to be set in, really making the atmosphere better in just about every way, reflecting the mood in a very effective way.\nDescribing the genre of the anime is kind of hard as it boarders on the line of schizophrenic, making one laugh at the great comedy displayed while making one turn away in certain areas of extreme gritty and gory moments. Again this is very much like Pulp Fiction, that movie could have been a really serious and gritty movie, but then the characters wouldn't be that likeable, so Tarantino made the characters kind of goofy with funny dialogue and good characteristics.\nHere I will go into something that people might not want to take into a review, and that is if you should watch it subbed or dubbed.\nThis is really up to everyone's own  discretion, some like it dubbed and others simply loath it, and since i have heard some really terrible dubs I can sympathise.\nBut there are good dubs out there and this is really one of them. \nAs all the characters are American or European, some of the English voices simply, to me at least, suit the characters better and suit the entire anime in a strange way. Some  imitated 30s American-gangster accents may not be perfect, but they are certainly not bad.\nBut of course this is up to you, watch it the way you prefer it.\nIt was really an enjoyable series and really showed what good storytelling anime are capable of, shining as a truly great work of art where story, animation and the  characters really make it a truly outstanding work of fiction.\nThe one complaint I would have with the series would be that it is only 13 episodes, but the re-watch value is truly high. So I forgive it for this minor shortcoming.\nHowever, with all this said a give this anime a really good recommendation and can recommend it to just about anyone, it is truly something that I think could make some people view anime in a different way after seeing. a truly defining masterpiece.\n        "},

However, I'm well-informed that I should continue with the series to grab the essence of the story and true enough it didn't let me down. The way the mangaka develops the characters surprised me as with that many characters at hand, I understood each character pretty well. The art was disappointing but that's alright because at some point it gets too bloody hence I don't really care if the animation is precise. \nIn all, the most important reason I hang on was the fact that it was a mere\n          \n        13 episode series.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I’ve seen a lot of good animes lately, but after a while, you begin to realize that an awful lot of animes tend to carry the same themes, jokes, and overall styles. However, after being whole-heartedly recommended to check out Baccano, I can say with certainty, there is nothing quite like this anime.\nI went into Baccano not really knowing what to expect. Reading short synopses didn’t really help much… alchemy, immortals, mafia families, but what really caught my eye, was the tagline, “Baccano ain’t about beginnings and ends. It’s about the twists and turns. Paths don’t cross in this story – they collide. Every Dick\n          \n        and Jane plays the lead…” That’s what was interesting, that every character plays the lead role, rather than one protagonist. So with my interest piqued, I pop in the show. \nFirst of all, I have to say that this anime reminded me a lot of Pulp Fiction… you know, that Quentin Tarantino flick, with Sam Jackson and Bruce Willis? The way it reminds me of that movie, is mainly the way the story is told. The entire 16 episode series is told almost completely out of order. One minute, you’re in 1930, then suddenly in 1932, then a little back to 1931, then for a couple episodes, we’re all the way back in the 1700’s! These particular episodes explain much of the story. Surprisingly, much like Pulp Fiction, it’s not confusing to follow. It may be a bit at first, but the show has a subtle, but effective way of filling you in on what’s going on. I’ll let you figure it out for yourself.\nOne thing I should mention is the voice acting. It is some of the best I have ever heard. This anime is released by Funimation, but there are a lot of names I’ve never heard of before. The only names I recognize are Brina Palencia, Caitlin Glass, and J. Michael Tatum. But the rest of the cast is fantastic, using the 1930’s gangster accent to amazing effect. It’s extremely well done, and I look forward to seeing some of these VA’s in future releases. \nThe music… oh man the music. The show regularly uses up-tempo Jazz music to great effect. The opening theme in particular, “Guns and Roses” by Paradise Lunch is amazing and marks one of the few times I listen to an anime’s opening each time it comes across, not only because the “previously on” is included in the opening. The only track I don’t particularly care for, is the ending theme, which I can’t recall its title. Compared to the rest of the soundtrack, it’s out of place, and I usually end up skipping it to get to the next episode. However, it is a Yuki Kajiura track, and I do like her music, and this is a good song, but as stated before, compared to the rest of the soundtrack, it feels as it doesn’t belong.\nThe art style is very nice, and feels very much like a film Noir. It’s very dark, and yet colorful at the same time, if that makes any sense. It’s actually quite interesting to think, that this is a Japanese show, with tons of American movie references, to be released in America. I actually believe that the show director got most of his influence watching “The Untouchables,” at least according to the commentary. Speaking of commentaries, that is a nice bonus included with the anime classics collection. I really wish more animes would include commentaries. It’s nice to hear what goes on behind the scenes of these shows.\nLastly, I have to give a shout-out to the characters of Isaac and Miria. These lovable losers are the shows comedic relief, to say the least, and are always good for a laugh. The show would be quite dark without them, and it doesn’t hurt that they tend to run into the other characters regularly. The rest of the characters are great as well, in fact, I don’t think that there is any character that I don’t like, although I must admit that I didn’t care for Isaac and Miria at first, though they quickly grew on me. \nIn conclusion, I say once again that this show is fantastic, and simply a blast to watch. There really is nothing quite like it, and it comes with nothing but the highest recommendations from me. Last I checked, it’s only around 20 dollars on amazon, so check it out as soon as you can. A rare perfect Ten from me.\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    I did a little research on Baccano's meaning. It is actually an italian word that means din. A din is a loud, unpleasant, and prolonged noise. (see google for more details). Some websites say that Baccano! also means row when translated to english. I didn't know what was its relevance to the story but either way,this anime is just one hell of a show. \nSince the creator of this anime is also the one who wrote my other favorite anime, Durarara! (you should watch DRRR! too), I thought I'd give it a shot. Also, one of my friends here in MAL told me that it's\n          \n        pretty good. Here's what I'll say about this anime that aired last 2007:\nDiegesis - 9\nBaccano! has one of those stories that people should see and hear. Why am I saying this exactly? Well for those of you who haven't had a glimpse of Baccano! try to do \"soul-searching\" because you guys are missing out on a perfectly made anime. Basically, one of its potential is the story itself. The plot sets in at different era and it also depicts at Western countries and cities. Baccano! shows what happens at the year 1600's, 1700's, 1929 - 1931, and 2000's (if I'm not mistaken) and every backstory of the main characters who are sadists, weapon experts, mafias, gangsters, gunslingers, assassins, thieves, alchemists and other badass guys who are suppose to be the villains but instead became main characters. Each character have their own perspective and contribution to the synopsis which will reunite all of them because of one simple thing: Immortality. Yes, you've heard the never-gets-old-and-never-dies-\"Immortality\" and this show proved how great it is to become immortal. To me, the story is like a puzzle, every moment and scene is related to one another which what makes everything interesting and fun to examine. I got hooked up from the very start and never laid my eyes on any other anime until I finish this one. Why give this a 9? Simply because there were some loose ends (only a few), some parts were a bit rushed and the romance may be a little bit forced. Don't get me wrong, I like it when shounen series add a little romance; however there are specifically 2 characters that I can't help why they got together so instantly. I  just didn't get the whole idea of love at first sight or is it just me? Anyways, the story is worth seeing, it is actually the whole point why I watch this serie.\nGraphics - definitely 8\nWhile it isn't as great as SHAFT and KyoAni's modern, High quality and high definition animation, it definitely has strength when it comes to making an art murky and somber. Visual effects were especially compelling. When it comes to violent scenes, blood squirting, and the setting itself. The train was what I'd like the most. People would say that its art was visually simple; however, in my case it may have some plain sketches or so but when put together it seem so alluring and sophisticated. As the people say, Simplicity is beauty. The eyes of the characters were not so distracting which is why its art relates to the story. \nSupporting and Main Cast - 9\nCharacters were really awesome from the protagonists to the subordinates. Yes, I know there are a lot of main characters but you know, they did make the story great because of each character. Miria and Isaac were the comical characters. They gave life to this anime because of their perkiness, humourous behavior, and the power to make people trust them. There were also 3 female characters that looked exactly alike in my opinion. If not the appearance, the personality I guess. These three were Rachel, Chanet, and Ennis. These three girls appear innocent and elegant but they are more than that. Ladd Ruso is a funny sadist who kind of resembles Izaya who may be mentally ill and wants to control the lives of the people. The same goes to \"Viro\" he is really like Izaya who may be a bit crazy however there is a twist in his story. Maiza and Firo get along well and both have relaxing personalities that weren't too annoying. Czeslaw is a young boy who may know nothing but appears to have many secrets. \nWhat I didn't like were Eve and Dallas Genohard who did not really caught my eye. I also think that the Vice President and the little girl (whom I forgot the name) wasn't necessary in the story. I don't know, it was better that they did not show up. For the supporting characters, I surprisingly liked Elmer because of his positive energy. \nMusic - 7\nThe opening song was fantastic. It quickly reminded me of Cowboy Bebop because of its saxophone and upbeat tempo. The ending songs was slow paced and isn't appealing. I just didn't like it because I focused on the plot and the characters. The background music and sound effects were not memorable for me. I was only interested in the opening theme. For the voice actors, to be honest, I like the english dub better. The english dub gave more accent and personality to the characters. Their gestures really was adequate with the accent. There was a british accent, gangster accent etc. It added more toughness and fierceness to the characters. I only watched episode 1- 4 in japanese dub but I liked english dub more.\nEnjoyment - 8\nMiria and Isaac made me laugh and the dramatic backstory clearly made me enjoy this anime. The turn of events were mostly unexpected especially the romance. I was contented with the ending and continued on with the OVA also. \nOverall - What I didn't know was that I never realized how this serie was so awesome. From its intricate plot to the finely made characters. Everything seem so perfect. Although there were little flaws here and there, I absolutely think this was spectacular. I hope fans who likes this kind of genre and those who don't would try this anime like me. Try to see Durarara! too. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    To say Baccano! is something original and fresh in anime would be an understatement. An anime set in 1930's America, with three main plot arcs being tied across different years, and out of order at that, is a big plate to fill. Throw in over a dozen characters that are introduced, and this is over a short course of 13 episodes. The best part? All of it works.\nStory - 9/10\nThe most unique thing about Baccano! is the Pulp Fiction style of storytelling showing the events of the plot out of order. I thought this was going to be a cheap gimmick to keep me watching\n          \n        but it turns out to be an intuitive method to it's own madness. While it seems confusing at first, the plot lines unwind eventually and it leaves just enough in the dark to keep an interesting level of viewer interpretation open, which turns out to be both interesting and effective. While there is risk in telling three main stories that one or two may not be up to par with another, that was luckily not the case. While I favored the chaos going on aboard The Flying Pussyfoot (that's the train's name, I swear), I was never disinterested with everything else Baccano! had to offer. The only thing I could fault the story for is that it transitions from moment to moment in some odd manners at times, and the first few episodes can seem overwhelming enough to have viewers dropping it in fear of it being overly complex. I urge anyone who tries this anime to stick with it though, because really all you need is a little attention to pay it and the rest of the story will tell itself.\nAnimation - 8/10\nWhen anything is set in a period like this I always take note of the design of everything from the character clothes to the cars. It's all done justice here. There are so many characters and they all stand out in one way or another in their design. Fight scenes are exceptional, and there are some crazy moments of violence that caught me by surprise. The devouring in particular was awesome. There were however some dark moments where, even watching in HD on my 32 inch TV, I couldn't quite tell what was happening. The lighting isn't a significant nor a consistent problem, but you will know it when you see it.\nSound - 10/10\nTop to bottom, probably the closest we've ever come to having a Cowboy Bebop level of both music and english dub. The opening theme is so much fun that I actually let it play every single episode. The rest of the soundtrack is wonderfully fitting for the setting and catches it's moments perfectly. When the action kicks up it's fast paced and lively, and when the show slows down and creates moments of terror or suspense the music adapts gracefully. The musical compositions are really a tour de force, sounding perfectly fitting with every note.\nThe voices are superb as well. Ladd Russo is the stand out with what sounds like a once in a lifetime kind of performance given the kind of dialogue and character that he is. Bryan Massey hits it out of the park with Ladd, helping to personify one of the most interesting yet psychotic sadists I've witnessed in anything. Everyone else is all high quality as well. From Isaac and Miria to Nice or Szilard, the cast is stacked with not only culturally accurate accents that sound natural, but believable performances that never falter no matter what the moment is.\nCharacters - 10/10\nDespite the level of risk in having a show with no main character, and many characters having importance to the events of the story, Baccano succeeds in having a cast with tons of likable people and entertaining personalities. Even the one guy who seemed pre-destined to be hated (Not hard to guess, it's the one named Jacuzzi Splot) ends up being someone I really enjoyed by the time it was all over. The strength in the characters isn't so much that they all develop well, but simply that they are all unique and entertaining in varying ways, a parallel to the very thing that makes Baccano! entertaining to begin with.\nMy favorite might be Ladd Russo, a certified wack-job with very interesting philosophies on killing. Ladd may just be the most oddly entertaining member of the cast. He's a baddie in every way, yet is so much fun to watch, even when he's doing disgustingly shocking things. The performance and writing of the character created one hell of a persona in Ladd Russo.\nNobody can talk about the characters of Baccano! without talking about Isaac and Miria. Literally every moment they have on screen is flawless, and they serve as the comic relief in a world that's mostly serious outside of these two people. Isaac and Miria are not only a cute couple (Best ever? I would take the bet.), but they're so wacky and out of their minds that it's hard to help but laugh and smile whilst watching them. Isaac and Miria are truly a charming pair.\nOverall - 10/10\nBaccano seemingly has everything going for it. Brilliant storytelling, very good animation, wonderful music and voice acting, a rich cast of characters, and it doesn't stop there. The show is versatile in displaying moments of suspense, comedy, action, and even a little romance. There's something here for everyone, and to pull that off within a modest 13 episodes is breathtaking.\n        "},

Baccano! has many sub-stories that follow a different set or individual character, all of which click together and form one large scale story.Its, again , amazingly well-paces and entertaining to follow.\nIt has an incredibly well balanced plate of action,comedy and drama so you never feel overwhelmed by once specific emotion but are constantly at elated an abundance of them.\n"},

The story is told in a non-linear fashion, giving snippets of information about three separate plotlines that all tie together by the end. Think Pulp Fiction style storytelling, but with much smaller segments. The story itself is incredibly interesting, though it can be a bit hard to follow the first time you watch it. The non-linear storytelling is good at hiding details that would otherwise make other parts\n          \n        of the story straight forward and less interesting. The experience of watching this show lies more in piecing it together yourself than simply being presented a story, and in this way it makes the story a bit more fun. The story itself is also insanely fun as you watch mobsters gunning each other down and taking part in crazy shenanigans. For example, one of the plotlines centers around the events that took place on a very large and prestigious steam train as three separate gangs vie for control, all the while a rumored monster is stalking the rails killing random people.\nAnother great part about the presentation style of the show is that the characters dictate the plot. The characters themselves are all interesting and easily identifiable (the main ones at least). Each character has their own clearly defined motivation which usually results in intense clashes with other characters as they cross paths. Isaac and Miria, probably the most iconic characters from the show, are by far the most fun to watch. They are a non-romantic crime duo that shares half a brain between them. They aren't stupid, but they are often times hilariously naive and downright silly.\nThe music in this show is superb, from the opening song to the skin-crawling violins during tense bouts on the train. It has excellent music direction, and there isn't much more I can say about it.\nThe art can sometimes get a bit chunky and weird as details are sometimes added at strange times. It's hard to give an example of this without sounding like I'm nitpicking, but overall the art is very good and the action scenes are very well animated.\nBaccano! is a show that every fan of anime should watch. It's fun, fast, and memorable. The story can be a bit confusing at first, but becomes clearer, and in someways more enjoyable, with each subsequent viewing.\n        "},

The characters in this show are absolutely charming which made me love every minute of this anime.\nThe story was executed wonderfully, almost like that of a Tarantino film; bits of details and separate stories slowly being pieced together and finally coming into one.\nI highly recommend this anime to anyone who hasn't seen it before!\n(Still hoping the rest of the light novels will be animated because I love this series so much)\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    When I first came across this anime, I was looking doubtfully at the 13 episodes but the ranking of the anime change my mind and I was like Whatever, let's try something new. I was really surprised at how great the series was and the content was to my liking! People! There is a reason why this anime has a very high rating! Just a word of advice though, this anime could be higher but it doesn't appeal to everyone because of the simple storyline told in a dynamic POV of multiple characters and the gore that resides in it. \nStory 10/10\nNow, the story is\n          \n        actually simple but it was told in a refreshing way. When you reach the end of the series all the puzzle pieces will fit together leaving a tight knit story that continued to the OVA. The story, well actually there were three story in one not including the narrator who told the story. First was about the people who gains immortallity, second one was a mess of events in mafia and lastly the flying pussyfoot. The story will leave you wanting for more but it is not for those who don't like to go with the flow\nArt 10/10\nIt's pretty and high standard compared to other animes. The movements are fluid, the designs are not neglected and it brings out the character and the colour scale fit the olden times of Chicago. it very well made! Watch it and you can see that this 13 eps have graphic eye candy except for the gore which is fairy goreish. Note to self do not eat while watching gore. (The gore is minimum and tolerable though. Need to get used to it). The opening was well made and it made me love the series even more\nSound 10/10\nThe bass and soft and spunky jazz music fits the story and it's premise. Everytime you watch a scene unfold, you could swear that you heard something new and pleasing. The very good thing about the music was that it leaves an impact on you that weave into the scene. At least it is alot better than some western premised anime laced with japanese traditional music. That would be akward. The sound is definately a win. In no time you might be humming the song opening!\nCharacter 10/10\nHere's the kicker. The characters are the reason the story shone like a beacon. Each person in the story is a main character and all of them had different personalities that draws you in. Each have their motivations and insanities and so on. You could bever guess what ghey would throw at you next but you will grow attached to the characters. The characters range from the comedic duo Miria and Issac to the silen but beautiful chane laforet and the mad Ladd russo. My favourite is Firo and Miria and Issac! But I have to agree that miria and issac took the cake of the most well loved characters. Why? They are the one who puts comedy in this otherwise intruiging and violent story. They would go so far as to even make you hold your stomach in pain of laughter. You can never forget the characters. \nEnjoyment 10/10\nThe series is enjoyable just as long as you go with the flow. The only downside was that people don't have the patience to go through the story weaved in a complicated web of spiderwebs but don't forget a spiderweb is made of one strand which is the story which is actually simple. The series will leave you satisfied byt craving for more! There is a flair to it. And it is worthwhile to watch.\nOverall 10/10\nThere are some animes that will be forgotten but BACANNo which means chaos in italian is a show that you will never forget in a lifetime and its enjoyable to watch again and see the story unfold once more.\nThat's it for now.\nCiao-ciao!\nYuni\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Baccano! is one of the highly regarded and recommended animes that truly deserves to be treated as such. \nI have to begin by saying that the first few episodes are some of the most confusing episodes of anime I have ever seen but that even if you find yourself thinking the same thing, it's very worth it to continue watching to the end. You're introduced to a large cast of characters each with their own interesting backgrounds and personalities and at first it can be really confusing figuring out who is who. The time skips also add to this confusion but again don't let this\n          \n        be a reason for you to give up! Once you figure out what's going on, the amazingness of the overall story is to be appreciated. \nBaccano! gets really dark at times with a lot of people getting killed, but this is usually offset by the appearance of Isaac and Miria who are off doing something outrageous yet again. Although there are so many characters and they don't each get a lot of screen time, it's still easy to like (or hate) them. \nThe comedy mixed with an intricate plot and many wtf moments is the formula that Baccano! makes very good use of to make this anime great.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Baccano is a one true example of an anime that breaks all stereotypes.It has no fanservice,a great interesting story and various intriguing characters.It is a truly unique anime in itself.\nThe story is set in the late 1930's in North America.The story follows a number of charcters and their lives,which basically revolve around the same thing.The place of the plot either takes the place on the contraversially-named train Flying-Pussyfoot or the city known as the base of large mafia families,Chicago.The lives of characters get intertwined accidentaly,or purposely,and the thing that connects them and which the whole story revolves around is the immortal elixir.\nBaccano begins its story\n          \n        rather confusingly and slowly,the viewer might find himself in daze because of the large number of characters introduced in first few episodes,as well as the time flips between the plot happening on the train and the one happening a year earlier in Chicago.However,the show comepnsates for its lack of clarity after the few episodes with its various types of interesting  characters and their clash of diffirent motives ,as well as tragic back stories.Every character gets their own spotlight and a chance to tell their story,and as the story proceeds  it becomes absorbing and leaves you wanting to know more about them.The diversity of characters makes the story,which is intersting for itself given its odd unstereotyical setting ,all the more enjoyable.It can range from bubbly euophoric robbers to witty bloodshedding psychopaths.The only thing that I could against it,are a lot of unnecessary inserted charcters ,which contribute close to nothing to the story and take the space up for the main charcters,which there are MANY,so that there isn't enough screen time for everyone.The one good example of it is the supposedly main character Firo Prochainezo,it makes it real shame for a character like him to show up so rarely.However,all these mistakes don't make Baccano a less enjoyable show,although at the same time ti isn't something I could completely overlook.\nNow,what makes this show truly amazing,besides alll the little faults,is the capability of the makers to merge the detective aspect with the supernatural elements and make it fit so smoothly.After reading the synopsys,some may think how the storyline sounds absurd,but actually it makes it more amusing and adds to the complexety of the story.Also,the comedic and light-hearted moments of the show mix perfectly wiht the serious and dark aspect.\nHowever,I wouldn't call this show only amusing,being introduced to a number of diffirent back stories,which takes us deeper behind the motives of characters thus showing us the emotional side of Baccano,beside all the blood-shed and violence it is inundated with.It makes Baccano a truly mind-boggling,exhilirating show that leaves the viewer in awe.\nThe music of the show is as show itself unique and fits perfectly,though it is not a masterpiece itself,but the imoprtant thing is it contributes to the atmosphere of it.\nI have to mention ,having watched Baccano dubbed,I whole-heartedly recommend it to everyone,since it contributes to a very Chicago-esque feeling and gives a new look to the characters with the unique Chicago accent they use.Also,it is one of the rare good dubs out there.\nIn the end,because of the confusion the first few episodes make,it can leave the viewer without the will to continue.However,this show develops into something so marvelous,that it counterweights the lack of a good introduction.I would also recommend,watching the Baccano specials ,which are a direct contunation of the show and are in my opnion even better,and who loved this show,will love them just as much."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I love this anime.  I'm not a particular fan of the prohibition era gangster stories but I really loved this anime.  Don't get turned off by the description... It sounds a little boring for what it actually is in my opinion.  Also the first episode is a bit weird and not entirely necessary for the flow of the show.  Honestly it's more interesting the second time around.  So don't get turned off by the stuff with the Vice President and Carol at the very beginning! They're there to sort of set the ton of the story and the first episode\n          \n        is more used to introduce the characters and the main plot but the real story gets going in episode 2.  \nStory:  This is a truly original anime.  It takes a story that takes place over three years and mixes it around so that you only get the full picture at the very end.  Another interesting part is that the first episode is what happens at the end of the story.  It follows the events surrounding a group of people who's paths twist together by a series of chance encounters.  The story is a bit twisted, it being about immortals but there is still a solid level of sanity.  There is a lot of blood and murder and people enjoying it... But one of the things I love most is that the main murder actually has a sense of morality to who they chose to kill.  With the story jumping around between the 3 years it get's a bit confusing at times and you really need to pay attention while you watch or you will miss things.  But as you watch things will fall into place and by the end it will all make sense.  You might even have some \"Ohhhhhhh\" moments during the anime; I know I did.  \nIt really can't be stressed enough how important it is to pay attention to everything.  Because every little detail will become important in the total development of the story.  \nArt: The art is great.  The characters all have their own unique looks that aren't even seen in other animes.  The art gives each of the characters something more than other animes.  The actions is particularly great.  Instead of going in slow motion for parts like some animes do this one almost speeds up.  The characters blur just enough at times to make it more exciting while still letting you see everything that's going on.  It takes place during times when the mafia are big and they do a great job with the setting too.  \nMusic:  The music is so good.  It's big band jazz music that really fits the anime's rhythm.  I loved the anime just by hearing the OP.  I loved how the characters were all introduced with the music.  It's a new thing I havn't seen in other animes that i really liked.  The first time I saw it I predicted which character's I liked based on their short seen during the OP.  The jazzy music always comes in at perfect moments to set the mood and make everything more exciting.  One of my favorite OSTs.  \nCharacter: The characters are the best part of this anime, which is saying a lot.  Baccano! has some of the most interesting character I'v seen in an anime yet.  It's a short anime and you don't get a ton of character development but you still get a really good sense of who each of them are.  They're so unique you can't help but remember them.  (Sorry for using \"unique\" so much... it's the only word I can think of to describe its.... uniqueness xD )  The voicing is really good too.  I recognized most of the voices as some of my favorite and fairly popular voice actors but they don't sound the way they usually do so I wasn't stuck thinking \"All I hear is so and so.\"  There are a couple of different accents used and the voice actors all do a good job with them.  You really grow to love the characters and you'll find yourself saying things like \"aw... Jacuzzi... :)\"  Or giggling just at little things a character says or re-quoting a character right after they say something.   They are all so great I can't really pick a favorite character.  Though i finally did decide on Vino.  Then Firo and Jacuzzi.  If they were in a different anime almost any of them would still be my favorite.  \nThe anime technically ends after 13 episodes but there are 3 OVAs that tie up some unanswered questions that should just be considered part of the show.  I really recommend this anime.  It's a refreshing change from the usual anime styles.    \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Baccano! is based on the Japanese light novel series by Ryogho Narita & Katsumi Enami. The anime is told by many points of view with intersecting storylines and plot details and it is also a character ensemble anime because it really focus on more than one character. One part of the series is an elixir which can make you immortal and I already know all of you know what that means, but you can end the life of another immortal by absorbing them. Years later, the exilir is stolen and it moves around all throughout the city which leads up to the train, The Flying\n          \n        Pussyfoot. The storylines does intersect with one another now and then. You should really pay attention to each storyline in order to get it right and not get confused.\n\nLike I say, this is mainly an character ensemble anime and there is a lot of characters to remember, such as, Szilard Quates, an immortal who became immortal in 1711 and wants to exploit the exilir to the world but the others disagreed and he just kills the original immortals. Dallas Genoard, a small-time thug, was the first to steal the exilir and use it as well, unfortunately, him and his gang were caught by The Gandor Brothers (Keith, Berga & Luck)  but his sister Eve has been worried about him and tries to search for him, despite being scared of the gritty NY streets. We also met the comic reliefs of the show, Isaac Dian & Miria Harvent, eccentric yet moronic (also likable) thieves/lovers and they also encounter with other characters, such as, Firo Prochainezo & Maiza Avaro, from the Martillo family mafia and homunclus created by Szilard named Ennis, btw, cute girl but has the second-most weirdest name of the show.\n\nThere is Ladd Russo, who I swear, is the most crazy-ass sadistic homicidal killer I have seen in any other media. If him and the Joker would have met, well, it'll be fun to watch and the fact that he promises his fiancee, Lua Klein, that after he kills everybody on the train, he'll kill her. That's love for you, isn't it? Also, he is part of the Russo family mafia led by Placido Russo, who can't control the psycho motherfucker that is his nephew (Ladd). You also meet bootleggers by the identity of a shy and polite (you heard me) gang leader by the name of Jacuzzi Splot and who really named him that? Part of his gang is explosive expert and childhood friend of Jacuzzi's Nice Holystone, who still does this business despite losing a right eye and knife fighter Chane Laforet and there is also Czeslaw Meyer, who's been a immortal child ever since 1711 and also has been the result of getting beaten to death, stab in the eye with a hot coal and shot numerous times. You probably get sick of that, too.\n\nThe animation is really great, capturing the timeline and style of 1930s New York and Chicago and all the surroundings. The story and characters will have you curious about each episode and the music is timely appropriate and the opening theme and sequence (above me) is very well done and that includes the song, \"Guns & Roses\" by Paradise Lunch.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:This is a delightful show to watch. It has a interesting plot and storyline with characters you might relate to, despite some massive violence by Shoot' em Up Russo. I would recommend this for any anime voyeur or beginner.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Baccano! is one of the first anime series I watched via internet when it was airing and it'll be my first review on here. I never read the novels, so I won't be able to compare the anime to the original work, but even without it, this is an amazing series. \nI thought the abnormal order of the story and having 3 story arcs at the same time was kind of confusing at first, but later I got used to it and in the end I loved how it was uniquely structured. \nThe story is really interesting, so you must check it out yourself. I'm\n          \n        not being lazy to write the summary or anything, I swear. :'D\nTHE CAST WAS AWESOME. It made me fall for Yoshino Hiroyuki ( I think Firo was one of the first of his major roles). And everyone else for that matter. XD\nTo be honest, I think Baccano! anime was 124346 times better than Durarara!! anime because the story is simply stunning and too awesome for me to handle. (Not that Drrr!! sucks, but 12-13eps/3vol of novels are much better than 24-26eps/3vol)\nAnyways, I'm definitely re-watching this soon because I found the complete DVD set at the local library. Booyah! It's one of those series that I should watch once in a few years. 8D\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    SUGOI ISAAC!!!!\nBonnie and Clyde are boring as rain compared to Isaac and Miria - an awesome duo of crazy but kind hearted thiefs.\nBaccano is not about those two, at least intirely.\nA group of alchemists summon a demon aboard the ship ''Advenna Avis'' so they can learn the secret of immortality.\nSomehow that event is connected with a series of incidents that took place on the train ''Flying Pussyfoot''.\nStorytelling takes a diferent aproach here. You will be presented with diferent angles of the same scene and that will either make love the series or make you feel utterly bored.\nBaccano is about immortality and what you can do\n          \n        with it. A burden? A gift?\nThose issues will be explored and displayed during the story.\nThe art? Very Simple. I will say 'old shcool'. But super pleasant. It fits the story perfectly. It gives you a rough kinda feel but proper of the 1930's. Prepare yourself for being blown away away with brutal scenes, funny scenes, witty ones and breath-taking others.\nThe music? The best part! Mostly jazz and even if you're not a fan of the genre (such as me) you will love it. There is not a SINGLE moment where the sound is misplaced. From the opening to the even more irrelevant parts.\nIt's pretty impressive how good they explored the background of each character, in a way you will feel sympathetic towards them, in only 13 episodes. No, they won't make an episode dedicated to a certain character but they will give you the necessary information so that you understand the actions of the people involved.\nThis is NOT my favourite anime genre. However I decided  to give it a try and I don't regret that decision.\nOverall, Baccano is something that will make you laugh, will make you angry, will make think and cry.\nIf you can make past the 1st episode then you'll be hooked.\nYou will be spared the overused clichés and fanservice (Although I found those features healthy) and given a great story.\nMostly it will make you say: ''13 episodes are NOT enough''\nNow go watch it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    The first couple minutes of Baccano! didn't really grab my attention so I considered watching something else at the time, but I'm really glad that I watched the entire series because it has become one of my absolute favorite anime.\nThe story is set in America during the 1930s and is shown in a non-linear manner. This may cause it to seem very confusing at first, but the pieces fall into place as the episodes progress. There are three main story lines. while each one is individually interesting, it's much more enjoyable seeing how the three events are related to one another. Even with all the\n          \n        jumps around the timeline, it didn't feel like the series was paced to quickly making it difficult to understand. The story wasn't paced too slowly either, at least not to the point of boredom in my opinion. Baccano! is also packed with action and good laughs, which are some of the strong points of the show.\nThere is a myriad of characters in Baccano! and most of them, if not all, are very unique and interesting. Including a comedic duo of thieves, alchemists set on perfecting the elixir of life, and some crazed, deranged assassins, all the characters have important roles that help bind the separate story lines together. Of course there were characters that I didn't care much for, but there were others that I absolutely loved. A slight downside to the large group of characters may be that there isn't really room for development for each individual person. Since the series only spans 13 episodes and 3 OVAs, it's understandable that the story as a whole is focused at the forefront rather than the development of every character. Nonetheless, the various characters are what make Baccano! interesting.\nThe art and animation of Baccano! is also great. Every scene looked smooth and flowed really well. As for the sound, the music fit the series perfectly with its jazzy tunes.\nOverall, Baccano! is an amazing show, and I highly recommend it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    When I first started this it looked like your average mystery anime, but it's actually not. It's ridiculously confusing and when you see the year you need to remember it because they'll show another one and in order to figure out what's going on you need to pay attention. If you don't it will get really confusing. They don't give the plot straight to you it's jumbled in pieces and you have to watch the full thing to figure it out. \nStory- If you can understand it it's pretty good. Still the confusion factor is a minus.\nArt- It was pretty average most of it was\n          \n        red...\nSound- It set the mood well and I found a familiar voice actor and it made me really happy.\nCharacter- Cosplay thieves, mafia, demons, immortals, what's not to love? I wouldn't say there is a definite main character in this just like they discuss in the first episode. Isaac and Miria were for sure some of my favorites. Their 'common sense' and how they get away with everything was so cute and hilarious. For some reason I liked some of the antagonists too like Vino in the end you see him in a new light and it's adorable. Character development? There is some for certain characters and it's pretty nice to see them grow. \nOverall- To be honest I wouldn't say this anime was amazing and it really aggravated me my website refused to let me watch it in peace. There was always something wrong like the sound would turn off and I had to watch it on my phone. Anyways it has it's own mysterious charm. It's a hit or miss anime and for me it was a hit. If you can deal with them constantly changing scenes to completely different time periods you'll probably like it. I enjoyed it even though it didn't really keep me hooked on to it. It's just one of those if you watch it all the way though it just kinda sticks with you because it's so weird and random. This anime is like eating chocolate but it just tastes like air if that makes any sense. Like you expect more but at the same time it just feels like it ended. Lol I'll stop before I confuse you anymore bye.\nThanks for reading ^~^"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    When searching out anime with violence and decent plots I stumbled upon Baccano!, what has to be one of the most original concepts in anime. Set in 1930’s America on the train the Flying Pussyfoot (Hardy-har-har) it is replete with awesome characters, great dialogue, a neat plot, and a cool way of telling the story that doesn’t actually confuse as much as it should. The series’ ability to portray so many varied characters, give us a compelling plot, and have absolutely no part that makes me cringe or groan, makes this a true staple for all anime fans.\nStory\nThe story jumps around a lot, but it\n          \n        doesn’t take a lot of brain power to understand the plot despite this jumping. There are about fifteen characters that are focused on to some degree and each one somehow has back story and  comes across as different from the next due to the excellent writing. The story centers around the Immortals, a group of people who made a pact with some sort of devilish entity to have eternal lives. This is while they are aboard a ship, presumably heading to the New World during the 1700’s. The story moves to the 1930’s and focuses mainly on a train ride that goes nuts. There are mafia on board, there are assassins, there are immortals. It’s a hell of a set up and makes for some awesome action. The idea of an anime centered around this time period in America is pretty fresh, and it is completely different from a lot of the typical anime fare. This is, of course, based off of a light novel series. The ideas are just so cool though and you want to see this keep going and going as the plot comes to a satisfying conclusion, but there is so much more that could be told.\nThe story is fantastic and one of the main reasons to stay aboard (I made a joke!) for the whole series, including the OVA’s. The show is relatively short at sixteen episodes, but it delivers with more story than a hundred episodes of Naruto can provide, and more compelling characters than pretty much every cookie cutter shounen out there. And with so many stories to watch play out, it’s hard not to find one that interests you.\nAnimation\nQuality animation, that’s for sure. The character models all look good and the backgrounds look especially good. New York, Chicago, and the train all have an old time feel that really helps create a mood and ambiance. Not that the thirties feel is pitch perfect, but I don’t completely expect it to be. It still has a lot of good detail. Fluid fight scenes also help the score.\nSound\nWhen talking about awesome anime intros, Bacanno’s can be right at the top of the list. An awesome opening song along with a great intro animation makes you want to watch it more. The ending song is meh. The music during the show is awesome once again and really fits with the time period. The voice actors are all good and the sound effects are good as well. No complaints here.\nCharacters\nIsaac and Miria are the stand-out characters, though Ladd Russo is also pretty spectacular. All the other characters are great, but some just stand out above others. Every character is connected, though you don’t see this sometimes until later on. None of the characters are really emotionally attachable, none are seen for a long enough portion for you to care that much, but they each have great back story and some will draw you in more than others. You get to choose between young lovers, idiot thieves, mafia, insane killers, torturers. All kinds of good people. They add copious amounts of humor, violence, depravity, and awesome to the series.\nOverall\nThis is not a perfect anime, as I may be sounding like it is. Chicago  has a lot of signs in Japanese, American books are  read Japanese style (backwards), and Times Squares biggest sign  advertises cup noodles. I digress though. It’s a great anime, but I will state that it will appeal to a certain crowd over others. Some may not like the setting nor the plot which can be a bit convoluted at times. It’s A-OK. Reviews are opinions of the author, not opinions of everyone as a consensus. But this does have a lot of excellent qualities to it. There’s a lot of gore, a lot of violence, and a lot of fun characters to stick out the series with. I can’t really complain about a lot because it appeals to me greatly.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Baccano! is a very special type of show that doesn't fit the typical anime mold. If you enjoy HBO shows such as Boardwalk Empire, or anime such as Death Parade or ERASED, then this is the show for you. If you don't, however, then I would avoid this show.\nStory:\nThe show expertly interleaves four parallel yet interconnected stories in a way that isn't confusing (note the OVA episodes are worse in quality). The plot is intricate and quite deep. Every time I rewatch this show I notice some things new. The anime adaptation and English voiceover is arguably one of the best representation of the West\n          \n        during the prohibition and gangster era I've seen, rivaling (superior in some ways) that of real life shows.\nArt:\nOn the positive side I will say that the art design is wonderful many characters are unique in his or her own way. The intro to the show is absolutely wonderful. Unfortunately as an older anime, the resolution of the show is lacking. If you were to compare this to modern anime the art may get a 6 or 7 but within the era this show aired I would say the art is quite good. Definitely great portrayals of the melting pot demographics of the United States.\nSound:\nThe into is great...have I said that enough? The series does a good job of bringing the era to life. Perhaps a bit repetitive in some aspects though.\nCharacter:\nThe characters of this show is arguably the strongest part of this anime. Almost every character on the show gets time to develop and changes by the end of the series. Even the senseless violent characters are developed with love and detail as the show goes into their psyche, helping the audience understand their motives.\nOverall:\nBaccano! is a show that I would recommend to my friends who don't like anime. The show is deceptively deep despite the seemingly senseless violence on the surface, the action, and gags.\n        "},

While its non-linear narrative can be quite confusing in the beginning, the payoff, when all of the story elements fall in place, makes it worth the watch. \nThe story takes place during Prohibition era in the United States, but it doesn't quite escape the Japanese cultural lens through which it was written, so some story and cultural elements may feel a bit off to American viewers. However, Baccano is a great story and well worth the watch, as it explores themes of mortality, brutality, loyalty, and most uniquely, story-telling itself. \nOne\n          \n        of Baccano's greatest appeals is its wide cast of crazy, larger than life characters. Though a solid half of them are total nut jobs, they still manage to maintain some grounding in reality, and no character relies too heavily on stereotypes. Most importantly, each will surprise you in their own way as their personal narratives begin to fall in place. Finally, while the cast does contain a good number of highly competent female leads, each tends to be quite stoic and submissive, making them feel more Japanese, than American. \nOverall, I give it 9/10\n        "},

In other words, there is one accident. However, there are as many stories explaining it, as many as there are people involved in it.\"\n— Gustav St. Germain, Episode 1.\nI've been wanting to watch this series these past years. Never really knew why I was not able to get a hold of this series, only until this year.\nBaccano! is a historical-themed anime, just because it is historical, does not mean that it's about the Japanese history or other things (World War I, World War II). As the\n          \n        date written on the synopsis, the anime is set in Chicago, 1930's. Now then, what would this anime be about? Given the supernatural tag, it must have something to do with ghosts or spirits, or something of the sort. Well, no. Supernatural, in this case, something that has a connection to being \"superhuman\". Not mostly, but you get the gist.\n\"There are two sides to every story.\"\nWell here in Baccano!, there are countless of them.\nAs I watched the first episode, I didn't really quite get what the two characters were talking, or what the story is and will be about. But as soon as I continued watching, I slowly got to understand it, even if it's just bit by bit. But there were still times and moments where I had so many questions in my mind about the certain happenings running in the show. But I finally understood it, shortly after. It is quite confusing, at first, since the series tend to jump from one scene to another every episode. But you'll be able to catch up with it soon after. For me, the plot and story of Baccano! is quite unique, as to say. It's simple, yet the impact and delivery of the story is great. Given that it only has 13 episodes, it was able to manage to sum it all up and—bam.\nThe highlight of this series is the characters, yes. I was really amazed, no jokes. I kept repeating how great the character connection is. They make the anime more amazing as it is. Each and every one of them have their roles and own side of story, and as expected—they delivered and starred it greatly, they also have their not-so-unique personalities, but somehow, it makes it seem like they have unique ones. At first, I used to dislike some of the characters, but shortly after, I came to like them a lot, since I was able to fully witness their stories and somewhat understand their goals. Some might have light role(s), but nevertheless, they are still like-able, but despite them being minor characters, they still hold a somewhat-huge role in the show.\nI really liked the opening of Baccano! even though it's only an instrumental. It kinda gives off a jazz kind of feeling, and it feels groovy. Something like that. The ending song on the other hand, is quite sad. It is a bit slow. And it somewhat seems like the artist is really feeling the message that is being conveyed by the lyrics. I liked it too, nonetheless. The sound effects were good too. Kind of feels like realistic. And the seiyuus, I must say, they've done a great job. And their voices suited the characters. Although at first, I thought that some of the characters didn't suit their voices. But I got over it, and kinda got used to it. In the end, all of it suited them perfectly.\nI truthfully enjoyed Baccano! a lot. Words aren't enough to describe how enjoyable and how great this series is, or how much I really liked it. Honestly, I still can't get over the fact that I've already finished this series. I've been anticipating every episode like crazy, and finished it in one go. It feels like 13 episodes is not enough to satisfy my needs—is what I had in mind. But despite that, Baccano! is one example as to how short-run anime should be able deliver its story perfectly, and leaving the audience hanging and wanting for more.\nA second season would be great. But thinking about it, Baccano! is fine as it is now. But oh well, you can't blame me. It's only natural that a fan would be wanting more from a great series.\nIf you're thinking about whether you should watch Baccano! or not, I recommend you watch it. It's a really amazing show with amazing story and characters. Checking it out wouldn't hurt, and I guarantee that you won't regret it.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Baccano! has got to be be my most favorite anime of all time.\nThe story may seem confusing in the beginning, which is not hard to imagine why. The anime is made up of three main storylines divided into three consecutive years, with more or less a different set of characters. Initially the plot may seem too much to handle for most viewers but as the show goes on, you can see these seemingly unrelated threads weave together to form a wonderful, interconnected story.\nWhat makes Baccano! different from a lot of animes out there is the setting. It takes place in the 1930s and in America,\n          \n        moreover. It tries its hardest to emulate the Prohibition Era with its use of jazz music and New York slang. I've seen both the subbed and dubbed version; they were both great but the dubbed version gave it an authenticity you can't find in the sub, which is not what you can say for most anime which has been given both treatments. The opening song is just a-m-a-z-i-n-g. Sure, it's just one featuring most of the characters being themselves to the tune of a wonderful jazz tune but it /works/. The ending song isn't much but it's still wonderfully subtle, downplaying the craziness that went down in the episode.\nThe artwork was quite good, though it's nothing too different. It's all the details that make it worthwhile though, and the fact that they didn't make all of the characters amazingly beautiful and none of them looked alike (except for those related, obviously). The backgrounds were great and I thought its use of darker, more neutral colors were fitting.\nThe characters were all so well-developed and incredibly diverse. Yes, most of them were ridiculously cartoonish but it worked. With such a short show, you'd think that such a large cast would make it a pain to watch. But no, it wouldn't be likely for you to confuse them given how unique all of them are (the OP was great in helping us memorize them and besides, with names like Jacuzzi Splot, Luck Gandor, Huey Laforet, who'd be likely to forget?).\nI was completely starstruck by the anime. Yes, it starts out slowly but once you get past the first two episodes, I guarantee that you'll be in for an amazing whirlwind of an anime. I've been in love with it after my first viewing and never looked back since. I understand the anime didn't get that much views in its initial run back in 2007 but don't let that stop you from watching it. The show had many competition in its season and I'm sad that it caused them to discontinue it. The anime had so much potential, and having read some of the source material, there are way more they could make from it.\n        "},

I think that the way the story jumps about in time and between characters might be confusing at first for some people but it definitely clears up as the series goes on and ties together fantastically towards the end. The series only covers the first few light novels and there is a lot of material that wasn't adapted, but don't worry the series stands on it's own and you do not need any of\n          \n        the novels to understand it. I really enjoyed the chaotic structure of the show and the way that you slowly join the dots with the different events and characters.\nThe art is very good, particularly the character designs. It strays away from the tropes of many action shows where all the main characters have some sort of specific gimmick or feature to make them stand out (heterochromia, dyed hair, etc.) yet still makes every character clearly distinct and easy to identify at a glance. The animation as well is fantastic and the fight scenes are really entertaining and well choreographed. My only complain with the art would be that sometimes the amount of blood is a bit excessive and unrealistic but that can be passed off as a stylistic choice.\nThe characters for the most part are really well developed despite the short length of the series and the strange structure of the episodes. There are only a few sections where character interactions seems a little unnatural or rushed which drag this down from being a 10 for characters.\nI had to give Baccano a 10 for enjoyment because I went into it only intending to watch a couple of episodes and ended up marathoning the entire series in one sitting, although I may be biased slightly because I love gangster movies and shows so I was more inclined to enjoy this show as well.\nOverall I think Baccano is definitely worth watching for anyone who likes action shows or shows with great characters.\n        "},

The first time I stopped watching the series after watching the opening.\nLets start by taking a look at the story..\nThe story is just AMAZING!! blew my mind...\nOne of the best stories told in non-linear fashion that I have ever seen. The best part is the\n          \n        non-linear story-telling doesn't bog the story or the viewer down. The story concentrates on what mostly happened during three years – 1930, 1931 and 1932. It connects seemingly unrelated events to build a story that is larger than anything you would've imagined in the beginning. So much so that you begin anticipating as to how things reached to the point of where they are in the future from where it was in the past.\nThe editing done on this series is also one of the best – gives nothing way and carries the sense of mystery throughout. \nAlso there is humour which always left me grinning(especially scenes which had Isaac Dian and Miria Harvent) and some scenes really make you laugh out loud.\nThats all I can say about the story without giving out any spoilers.\nCharacters\nHas the craziest cast of characters I've seen. And the number of characters is pretty large too. Again this doesn't bog the story down. In fact by the end of the series you will remember the name of all significant characters and their quirks. Also characters remain with you long after you've finished watching the show.    \nAnimation and Music\nNeither is the animation lacking in any way nor is it over the top. It is enough to tell the story, with nothing remarkable standing out. \nThe action scenes are executed very well. The violence is plenty and all of it had a realistic and raw feeling to it. \nThe background music is combination of jazz and sometimes the high pitch from the symphony  which stands out as the theme music of Baccano!(usually comes around the half-way break and the ending of the episodes)\nOverall the background music for scenes never felt misplaced and always felt right - which is all you need. I almost never skipped through the opening sequence as the tempo of the jazz just seemed to fit the craziness of Baccano!\nOverall I rate it 10/10 \nA masterpiece which I would whole-heartedly recommend anyone who has already watched some anime."},

But how wrong I was!\nThe predictability of the plot is approaching zero, the story is dynamic and interesting. Despite the gore and blood the characters remain strangely good-natured, though sometimes in their unorthodox and unique way. \nOverall, while watching Baccano you must always pay attention and think, you try and figure out what is going to happen next and you fail at it, but the feeling is\n          \n        fantastic. \n        "},

Albatross, Gretto Avaro, Fermet, Nile, Begg Garrott, Huey Laforet, Sylvie Lumiere, Szilard Quates and many others.\nThere are a few notes I need to mention before you start this anime:  \n1)If you decide this isn’t the anime for you, please wait until you’ve watched episode 9.  The anime progresses so much in just that episode.  So you must at least watch the first nine episodes before if you decide that you don’t want to watch this anime anymore.  You also get to meet Claire Stanfield who makes the whole anime amazing to watch (that’s my opinion at least)\n2) If this is your first time watching Baccano! then watch it with your full attention.  Don’t watch it in the background because you’ll most likely get confused when you watch it due to the switching of the different storylines.\n3) Don’t skip the opening because it includes all the names of the characters in the series\n4) Pay attention to scenes which involve Daily Days, an information shop disguised as a newspaper company, don’t ignore them!  They play an important role in the series due to knowing information about all the storylines in the anime.\nREVIEW\nStory \nAs explained in the synopsis, there are quite a few storylines in the anime.  Despite not having read the light novels which were written prior to the anime, I understood everything the first time I watched the series.  Some scenes in the first episode that aren’t explained due to there not being enough time in the anime, so it would be best to read the light novels to understand those scenes.\nAnimation \nCompared to other anime that I’ve watched, Baccano! doesn’t have the best animation that I’ve seen but I was very impressed by it.  The anime was animated in 2007, so there are a lot of differences between the quality of animation of 2007 and present time, but I liked it nevertheless.\nThe producers, Brain’s Base were also the producers for the Natsume Yuujinchou / Natsume’s Book of Friends anime series.  I have written a review on the first manga volume of the series which can be found here.\nCharacters \nI absolutely loved the characters (I tend to say that in every review I write but I get attached to series quite quickly).  There were so many of them but each of them had unique personalities that influenced how the story progresses in the anime.  My favourite characters were Claire Stanfield, Firo Prochainezo, Jacuzzi Splot, Nice Holystone and Luck Gandor.\nEnjoyment \nThis anime was amazing to watch.  Baccano! really follows the genres in this anime, so you know what you’re expecting the action, the historical aspects from the United States in the 1930s, the supernatural aspects from those who are immortal, and also the comedy which are mostly due to Isaac Dian and Miria Harvent (you’ll know who they are when you see them).\nOverall \nThis anime is a series that you must watch.  I’d been meaning to watch it for a while but didn’t really make the effort because it was set in 1930s of the United States…  When I realised how interesting the plot was due to there being so many storylines, I just had to watch it.  I really regret not watching this anime earlier.\n        "},

Honestly, I can't say nothing bad about them, well, Only Jacuzzi Splot has annoying voice but, FOR LOVE OF GOD DONT MESS WITH HIM OR ANYONE WHO HE LOVES!\nThe first episode is the end, the end is the begining and the middle is just fu*ked up somewhere. If you don't follow the\n          \n        story, you will be really confused. But you get all names of the characters in the opening, well ALMOST all...\nMy favorite characters here are Isaac and Miria, 2 chubby lubby couple that bring joy wherever they go! They both are fun, enjoyable and probably the best characters in there.\nAlso there is a monster on the train called The Rail Tracer which kills pasangers on board randomly.\nCharacters are really enjoyable even Jacuzzi gets damn badass...\n\nYou will see a lot of GORE scenes, romance, comedy, action, fighting and a little bit of Horror if you're new to the Anime community.\nThe animation is pretty also *-*\nI give this anime WELL deserved 10 out of 10 \n        "},

Forget linear storytelling-the series actually spends half an episode debating just how to tell its story through a sequence of meta dialogue between a newspaper vice-president and his secretary. What it settles on is scrambling a tale that already has a huge scope in terms of ground covered and characters included by jumping around between several seemingly unrelated storylines, and doesn't settle down until several episodes after that. And even then, even then, I still wouldn't blame you if you felt lost. Some people have said that it's disrespectful of the audience to do this-it's like throwing\n          \n        them out in the ocean without a life vest. But that's an odd criticism, since it implies that it's respectful to simply tell a story like anybody else would, using the same techniques we learned in 6th grade English class. Isn't that just milquetoast? And it's especially odd when you level that criticism in anime, where anything resembling \"normal\" is routinely routed, twisted and bungled for the sake of being as cool as possible\n        "},

Also WARNING! if you do not enjoy violence/gore don't watch this, as it has a lot of both.\nStory:\nOkay so the story is actually very confusing in the beginning. Don't let the first episode fool you, it gets much easier to understand later on. The story revolves around a series of events between 1930-32. Also the story is presented in a non-linear fashion. This means its told out of order. This story involves the mafia, a group of immortals, and a hijacking of a train called The Flying Pussyfoot. Yeah… seriously. \nArt/Sound:\nBoth\n          \n        the art and sound really do well to immerse you in this story. You really feel like you're in 1930's New York. Also I recommend watching the dub, as it's one of the best dubs I've ever listened to and you can hear all the accents. Also I'd like to mention the opening… just epic.\nCharacters:\nSo yeah. I've got to say 99% of the characters in this show are certifiably insane. From Ladd Russo, probably the craziest character eve, to Eve Genoard, who is the most innocent of them all. Even though the characters in this show do some pretty horrible things, they're all likable and you end up rooting for them throughout the whole show.\nEnjoyment:\nOverall I greatly enjoyed this series (it's only 13 episodes so you can knock it off easily). Apart from a sort of confusing storyline, this show is great and there is no reason to not pick it up right this second!\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    Before I write this review, I just want to point out that this is my first one and I hope people will like it. :) \nStory:\nAh, Baccano! Where do I start? Well first of all, it took me over five months to watch this anime, which is probably why I was confused for most of it. Despite that though, I did actually enjoy the story. It was quite compelling to watch, especially any scenes that involved Ladd Russo or Claire Stanfield (it took me a while to figure out who he was since the name had confused me a bit). I also liked that it\n          \n        was primarily set in the 1930's, it was a delightful change of setting from what I'm normally used to watching.\nArt:\nThe art was pretty good but I've seen better. There's not a lot more I can say about it. \nSound:\nAh, how I love music from the 20's and 30's. The opening was fantastic, I thought it was very catchy and the pieces of music played throughout the anime worked really well. I wasn't particularly fond of the ending though, I'm not really into slow songs. \nCharacters: \nMost of the characters were great but I found there were too many to focus on and keep track of. Again, taking huge breaks between episodes probably didn't help. My favourite characters would have to be Claire, Ladd, Graham (wow, was he a wacky guy or what?), Jacuzzi and of course Isaac and Miria (those two always made me laugh).\nEnjoyment:\nI enjoyed Baccano! quite a lot but would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't been so confused most of the time.\nOverall: \nAt the end of the day, Baccano! is an enjoyable anime. It's got an intriguing storyline and fun characters and I would definitely recommend everyone to watch it. :)\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Baccano is easily one of the greatest storytelling based animes in existence, due to the remarkable way in which they tell their stories-in a reversed order. Rather than a state of being or idea sparking into conflict after a long buildup baccano turns it the other way around-giving you the action first, and a backstory seen through the eyes of many people afterwards, giving you multiple perspectives, all of which create one giant storytelling web.\nStory-I couldn5 even start reviewing the story, because, well, theres an entire multitude of them, so i could never give you review of every story all in one broad explanation. I\n          \n        will tell you this-they were all executed perfectly, tailored to make you feel an emotion and ensure you feel that as much as you can. Depression, anxiety, hope, despair, anger, happiness, every character and scenario make you feel atleast one of these emotions, without confusing you of the stories intent. As for the plot lines quality, it is extremely unique and most of these doont even fall into any story archetypes (besides perhaps the gang stereotypes, e.g crazy shootouts don't fuck with us kind of shit.) The story is, with flying colors, a 1O out of 1O. Just make sure you can keep track however, because the stories liketo jump between one another quite often.\nArt-The artwork was actually very enjoyable because there was great character detail that showed their personalities well. Plus, its the roaring 2O's and 3O's. Its gonna be cool. 1O out of 1O for art.\nSound-Literally the jazziest intro song i've ever heard and it is particulary sweet. Plus the ending song is very dramatic and emotional, which is lovely. Nothing else notable, so I will give a 9 out of 1O, just to be professional.\nCharacters-They are the emotion and driving force behind this story. The characters are very unique, odd, and oftentimes fucked up but yet still identifiable usually (if you identify with ladd, of whom you will meet, then you are a fucking psychopath.) There surprisingly developed for there being literally 15 characters introduced in 13 episodes, and even show slight character development. I promise you, you will either fall in love with or strongly resent each character in which you meet. Strong 1O out of 1O.\nEnjoyment-Once again-great plot, and makes you feel every emotion in the book while forcing you to connect the dots. 1O out of 1O.\nOverall-I still give this show a 9 out of 1O rather than a 1O because this- the story is hard to follow. Actually, the many stories are. It can be a little overwhelming, especially just getting into the anime and not knowing what there actually doing and why you suddenly went from the flying pussyfoot 1932 to chicago 1931. Other than, it was a golden anime, and if you dig storytelling or even just something for sweet action and silly humor, you will love this. definetly in my top 1O anime.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    First review, gonna have to make this good:\nThe one word I can say about this anime is: FUN. This anime is pure fun. This is a very different anime than most people are use to, but it will grow on you immediately. For starters, it takes place in 1930's New York, unlike most anime which is based in japan. Everything from the accents in the dub (trust me the dub is awesome) to the smooth, jazz music in the anime and theme (which sounds so fun I never skip it) all has an excellent 30's look and feel. The story is written in a very\n          \n        odd way, in that the order is all over the place. Thus, you will need to pay attention or you may miss something. However, this doesn't bring the anime down, because it is done in a way that keeps you interested, and excited to see what happens next. It's not that the story is complex, it's just that the order is everywhere, so you don't need to worry about deep analysis or anything, but you still won't wanna miss anything. All the stories and order do tie into each other, and the payoff is worth it. The strongest aspect of the anime is the characters, they are all so much fun to watch. Most of the characters are criminals: Mafioso, thieves, killers, but they all have such likable and enjoyable personalities that you can't help but love them. The anime is also only 16 episodes, which is a good length, so if you have a day where you don't want to do anything all day but chill out in bed and watch some anime, check out Baccano! for a wild ride.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Baccano! Italiano! Digiorno!\nThe only other mafia anime I can think of is Reborn, but I think most will agree Reborn doesn't bring the brutal noir setting traditionally associated with the mafia. Needless to say, the sequential ordering of events in Baccano will confuse many viewers. The focus constantly jumps from one time period to another, chaining together seemingly unrelated events.\nNew and unexpected experiences should be welcomed. Yet, the reason why most anime choose to progress linearly is so the story is clear to the viewers. Unfortunately, Baccano is unclear. I scratched my head until the second half of the season, when the jigsaw pieces finally\n          \n        started coming together. There are so many characters, and the viewer doesn't learn about their backgrounds until later on.\nLuckily, Baccano excels in all the expected areas. The animation is fluid and detailed, especially the bloody gunfire scenes. Voice actors do an excellent job of bringing feeling to their characters. (English dub) There is a diverse assortment of personalities, ranging from blood-thirsty killers to dainty princesses.\nThe writers took some risks and failed. The animators did not take any risks, but they made sure the art was top-notch. And they succeeded, most definitely. Even if the broken story hampers the enjoyment of Baccano as an overall anime, every other aspect must be recognized as excellent.\n        "},

If you are looking for a good story about Mafia during Great Depression in America, this is the one. Eventhough there is some supernatural stuff going on, it totally has that Mafia story feeling, colorful characters, guns, suits, style, awesome jazzy soundracks, beatiful ladies, bastards, good guys, funny couple, shooting in bar, violent killers and those characters you are not quite sute if they are good or bad. Atmosphere of those good ol' fashioned Mafia movies in a nutshell. No main characters though, every character is equally main to\n          \n        the rest. So you are the one to choose, whom to be worried about. But you kinda gonna like all of them. If you have seen Durarara, it is quite similar. Except that it's about REAL criminals here, actual violence scenes take place with people dying and stuff. Easy and pleasant to watch. The only minus is that just like Durarara, it doesn't have that thrilling effect, which makes you are constantly worried about characters and future events, losing shit over cliffhangers and all that good stuff we are looking for in the anime. That's why only 8/10. But instead you just have that feeling like drinking beer at the end of the day enjoying good time. If you are marathon viewer, I'm not sure if you gonna like it, decide for yourself, but if like watching around 1-3 episodes a day just to relax, I RECOMMEND\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Un-fucking-believable. Despite having a huge cast of characters, each and every single one of them is interesting and compelling and has some form of development. Good storytelling in its purest form, not to mention the directing, script, animation and soundtrack are all fucking topgun. Sure, it's gory and edgy, but the show seems to revel in the way it depicts violence: it's unapologetic\nand ecstatic; it does not compromise; it shows the audience that there is fun in violence, that it is one of the most prominent and unavoidable aspects of life that one should not shy away from, but rather, revel in. Baccano's writing is\n          \n        a style of writing that never relents, and never half-asses an idea. It is confident in every stride and drives home the message it wants to drive no matter what; it is writing in its most unadulterated and elated form. Also, the OP song Guns & Roses is a love letter to life itself. It is jubilant and ecstatic; it makes you want to jump, scream, smash all the windows, light the curtains on fire, and break your laptop in half on knees. \nTLDR amazing series with compelling and larger-than-life characters, frantic and idiosyncratic storytelling, sublime soundtrack , all of which serve as a testament to the whims and joys of life itself.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="                          \n    Baccano is a rare gem.  The entire show is a chaotic ride through 3 interconnected stories told in a disjointed, non-linear style.  In many ways, that is what makes it great.  It allows for tight control of pacing and allows for better set ups for climaxes.  The art style and sound set up are tight and well done, but not exceptional.  The charterers are a grab bag of violent and cruel to zany.  Despite such a large cast, each character is developed and is a complete person, not merely a walking trope.\nI want to point out that Baccano takes\n          \n        two large risks and they pay off.  The first episode does not actually begin the story proper.  It is a conversation between 2 journalists discussing the nature of stories and where to begin one.  They go through various points in the time line and finally decide that there is no beginning or ending to a good story.  Another risk is to leave a major plot point unresolved.  In the context of the universe, this normally fatal move works well.  It gives the feeling that this world will continue and create more stories.\nIn short, Baccano is an enjoyable and excited romp with zany and lovable characters.  The series is vastly entertaining and well worth a second watch.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="                          \n    To rightfully start off this review I need to mention my motivation to watched this show. \nThis was a recommendation in a feature for a club where the theme is Historical.\nIt wasn’t long until I realized this show had no historical value to it at all and could be consider more of a train horror than anything. \nSo I had to refocus what I wanted from this show very quickly. \nIt also enlightened me on the plight of actual historical shows in anime. It is quite depressing how the genre is portrayed. \nThere is also a mystery tag provided for the show. Quite frankly I\n          \n        wasn’t very fond of the story style. \nThis Puzzle story style will essentially be the determining factor if you going to like Baccano.\nThat reason being because after the flashback episode is when the pieces of the puzzle started to come together.\nThey could of told this story in a chronological order and still produce the same results with the flashback episode shown in episode 7.\nI continue to brood over if this story style could of helped in any way but I just come up with a blank. \nI’m not really fond of when these writers or directors want to get too artsy instead of highlighting proper development. \nThe show comes off being all over the place for the first half and it leaves bad taste in your mouth for the much better second half. \nThis story style also had an adverse affect on me where I never got around to caring about these characters. \nThe most predominant characters of the show were Issac and Miria. They were basically there for Deredere comedy. \nWe finally get a true villain in Szilard Quates with the theme of human greed after the flashback episode\nBut even his death was just filling puzzle pieces. We clearly know some of the people he killed didn’t die because we were shown them alive in 1932. \nThus there aren’t any surprises with this show. It is just filled with “okay that is why that happened moments”. \nI’m left in state where I don’t really have any bad feelings about any of the character nor do I have any good feelings either. \nWe are left to just wait for the puzzle pieces to fall into place.\nI never found a moment where I was building the puzzle myself like a true mystery show would do. \nThen another reason why this really shouldn’t be considered a historical show is that is barely about the mafia itself. \nI also tend to really like faction warfare and that is something mafia shows are able to do.\nSadly we never are presented with a clear picture of the mafia world with the families like in 91 Days.  \nThey were just there for action fixes and not much development at least on the train. \nThe main concept regardless is the Cure All Elixir.\nThis is what gives the show it’s Supernatural element where a bunch of alchemists got together to find eternal life.\nThat is until they eat you with their hands. I thought that was creative.\nI do also like the presentation of the opening and ending video. I thought that was at least above average. \nBut without anything personal or anything I’m specialist in. There really isn’t much else I can talk about in this review. \nI believe the story is a solid 8 if it wasn’t for the puzzle story. I would knock that down to a 7 because of that. \nWithout anyone I truly cared about at the end I’d have to give characters a 5\nThen as for enjoyment. Even though it feels like I’d be giving this a 3 with how this review has come together. \nIf you single out certain segments of the show they were interesting. \nThe exchange between Vino and Russo’s principles was a nice clash but it didn’t help me get attached to any of them still.\nThey protected the characters credibility. I’d say my enjoyment was a 6.\nIn conclusion that is where I’m going to settle with my final score as well at a 6 out of 10. \nBeing that I liked the flashback episode the most; I wish there was more focus on the first generation immortals.\nInstead of explaining an environment on why all these people are on the same train at once or why we should care about this guy Dallas that all these different families have beef with.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="Baccano! Is an anime released in 2007 (which was quite a good year for anime) and stems from the light novel written by author Ryohgo Narita, it incredibly original anime series due to its complex narrative structure. Its presentation is certainly one to be admired as the story is very unorthodox and told in a very unique yet brilliant manner. The story expertly merges both the past and present, establishing keen insight to the series' substantial cast of characters and their backgrounds. With the first episode consisting of a delirious collage of brutal imagery, comical situations and perplexing character interactions, it is certainly confusing to\n          \n        say the least. But once Baccano! settles into a considerable pacing after its initial episodes it slowly builds and centres its narrative around a singular night on a train entitled The Flying Pussyfoot. It is here where the series constantly switches focus to different key characters, intersecting their roles to one another amidst the backdrop of mafia warfare, serial killers and supernatural immortals. Using that night as a focal point, Baccano! Implements a series of flashback sequences that take us as viewers into the bizarre and twisted view of a Prohibition-era America and beyond, mixing the harsh reality of that period with fantasy.\nThe story starts in an unusual manner and it would be best if you saw it rather than me spoiling it for you however the story revolves around a group of alchemists in the year 1711, who are granted an elixir of immortality, with the stipulation that they must kill each other until there can be only one. The now-immortal group unanimously decides it wasn't worth it and destroys the elixir; but one of them, Slizard Quates, starts to kill off his fellow immortals. To reduce the risk of Quates tracking them all down, the group separates and goes their separate ways. Neither of them crosses paths again till 1930, Manhattan, when Quates manages to create a new elixir of immortality. However, he loses it and it ends up going around town, taken to be a bottle of alcohol and unknowingly drunk by many residents. The drinkers of this new elixir include Isaac and Miria, an eccentric pair of thieves; the Gandor brothers, a Mafia family; and their associates in the Camorra, the Martillos (who employ some of the original immortals). And this new group of immortals are created.\nWith such mature themes expressed throughout, this anime is definitely not for the faint of heart. With its brutal depiction of death, torture and mutilation, the series does an excellent job in portraying the frenzied nature of an era where violence was perceived as a nature solution to most problems. With the aspects of violence being heavily implemented throughout the plot, the series also inserts various moments of humour and drama to offset it. While some of the violence may certainly be deemed over-the-top for some viewers, it delivers a refreshing outlook to an already creative approach, mainly because of the series' diverse cast of characters. This is where Baccano! works incredibly well. Given the rather large cast of characters, the series takes its time to explore their pasts and motives. Alongside the rather fluctuating narrative structure, the series doesn't introduce characters only to have them dissipate as the series advances—rather, the opposite occurs. The cast of Baccano! Each gets their share of character development, mostly reserving an entire episode to showcase their history and involvement up to the point of that fateful night on The Pussyfoot. This approach allows the characters to seem less archetypical in nature and more individualistic, allowing us as viewers to get to know their mannerisms and personalities. Granted, while some of the characters do in fact seem rather superficial at first, their confrontations and interactions redeem their perceived lack of individuality, thus showcasing just how contrasting they truly are. In essence, Baccano! doesn't necessarily have a \"main\" character in a tradition sense. The series moves from character to character at such a rapid pace, that a viewer isn't given much time to adjust to any one overall character. This again cements the unconventional approach offered consistently by the series, delivering a plethora of characters that complement the it's encompassing plot.\nIn regards to the animation, there was nothing particularly special about it but it, nothing really blew me away. I do have to point out that there were also inconsistencies with the animation, while many of the highlights of animation stem from the action sequences, some episodes do look better than others, with noticeable drops in animation that seem oddly out of place at moments—which is often the case with series over twelve episodes in length. What the series does do an adequate job on though is envisioning a gritty Prohibition-era New York City and Chicago. While being one of the few anime series to be situated primarily within America, the series brings an authentic look to its surroundings—from the architecture of buildings to the attire that characters wear; the series establishes itself visually pertaining to that specific time period. This artistic choice brings about muted and gray colors that permeate throughout the series, giving it a shabby vintage appearance that plays well into developing its world and also playing upon a realized nostalgic factor.\nDespite the somewhat complicated yet appealing nature of the plot, Baccano! Has an interesting and creative premise for an anime series, especially in this day and age where we see alot of anime rip-offs, it good to see an anime with an extremely unique plot. It's this adherence towards a nonconventional story that truly establishes the series as one that can stand out amongst many of the anime series within the last decade. It has a refreshing cast of characters that don't necessarily come off as individuals we've viewed in previous series, with considerable time given to each for character development. While not certainly for everyone, the series delivers a mature form of storytelling that doesn't easily attempt to portray characters in a rigid dichotomy between good or evil. In many instances, our initial perception of characters change substantially throughout the course of the series, each time introducing us as viewers to a new an interesting facet of their lives. Admittedly, the violence is certainly graphic at times, and this may be the deciding factor in certain viewers wanting to continue watching the series, but for those who don't mind such choices, it plays an integral part in showcasing the psyche of some of its characters. \n        "},

It is a very\n          \n        cool concept but at the same time it will cause some confusion for someone who is not paying full attention to the show, because it will jump back and forward from the different plots like it is nobodies business. when it comes to art, I don't really know that much about art, but i had no problem with it sooooooo... on to the sound. the sound track is like the story. freaking beautiful. the majority of the story takes place in New York in the 1930, also known as the \"Dirty Thirties\". and obviously, the soundtrack would be jazzy. and boy is it jazzy. don't believe me? just listen to the theme song \"Guns and Roses\". If that doesn't make you want to go to a speakeasy and dance with Issac and Miria, then i don't know what will. speaking of characters, they are all very enjoyable. they all just have likable personalities, which i find very challenging to do. especially because they are all likable because of different reasons. Ladd is likable for his ruthlessness while Issac and Miria are likable for their childish personalities and ability to make everyone laugh without trying. this was the anime that i have enjoyed to most by far. i have never found an anime that had this much rewatch-ability, but at the same time have an intense and funny story. I would definitely recommend this anime to someone looking fr an enjoyable anime.  \n        "},

ANYWAY the art has almost a western sort of style i think however again Baccano! has is a unique anime so i course its very different. \nsound: .. aye the sound.... well the sound fits every scene so perfectly its almost too perfect. it really captured the whole 1940's setup. especially the theme song which many people find catchy. mostly i want to focus on the scenes of chaos which were born to be represented by the amazing soundtracks. Chaos is the only word i can think of for Baccano! the music.. same deal. they're perfect for each other... nuff said.\nCharacters: the characters where do i even begin. ok first of all most of the characters have an important part in the plots. i swear all the characters are so likable its like you would never be able to forget them. Mainly im talking about Issac and Miria and the psychopathic killers. as usual all the characters are so unique and have different a wide variety of personalities its truly unbelievable. i just love how all of them as different in their own way and just unforgettable characters.

It's reminiscent of Tank; it's fresh, vibrant and pumps me up for 20 minutes of whiskey-swilling, gun-toting, train-robbing action.  In fact the premise of the show is pretty original and thrilling with a compelling mix of noir and sci-fi; it has so much potential, but loses a few points for shoddy execution.\nIf there's one major fault with Baccano, it's that the characters are somewhat lame, and unfortunately it's the characters that are supposed to anchor the narrative in this kind of series. Everyone has a gimmick and sometimes those traits cross the line from charming\n          \n        to annoying. Therefore your enjoyment of the series is almost entirely dependent on how much you can stand the characters. Jacuzzi is the worst kind of weak-willed do-gooder and I grew tired of him after about five minutes. Ladd and Graham similarly begin to grate on the nerves after prolonged exposure simply because they're one-trick ponies. How many times can you murder a guy with no provocation before it gets old? The rest of the diverse cast is okay, but no one really steals the show. \nFurthermore, a show about mafia syndicates and immortal alchemists absolutely screams for a certain subset of stylish, badass motherfuckers and pithy dialogue that just didn't happen. I guess it's unfair to compare it to something like Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, but it really can't compete. Perhaps subtitles are inherently unable to translate something as subtle as style and atmosphere, because the translations I had sounded terribly awkward, and I hope it didn't sound that way to a native Japanese. Incidentally a good English dub wouldn't try to slavishly stick to the subtitles but instead take more liberties with the dialogue to smooth it out and make it flow naturally.  \nThat said, Baccano's still enjoyable, and the whole turns out to be greater than the sum of its parts.\n        "},

One thing is that it was pretty confusing in the beginning, but make sure you keep watching because everything makes sense in the end(and it seriously feels like you are putting a puzzle together in the beginning) which is part of why this anime is good. But still the story is nothing like i have seen in any other anime so far.\nStory(9)- The story is quite something and I would have never expected that kind  a story like that one in an anime(keep in mind i am an amateur). But though it\n          \n        was unexpected it was very enjoyable. What i personally liked and what made this anime much more unique was that it was all happening in the 1930's.\nArt(8)- The art was good don't get me wrong but wasn't anything different then other animes with good art, but still even though it wasn't much different from others it was still very nice.\nCharacter(10)- There were so many characters in this anime, and the thing is that its not like where there are a few main characters and the rest support, no every character in the story has a role, a very important role that when put together finishes the puzzle.\nEnjoyment(9)- Well, don't think just because I say it's good it is good because this is based completely on opinion, but tell me. Who doesn't love mystery, lots of blood and shooting, and awesome characters!!! There is so much blood in this and because it has more of an up feel mood when you watch it, it makes it that much more awesome.\nIs it worth the time? It really depends. If you like a lot of blood and action, but with mystery and confusion mixed in then you will enjoy it and will definitely be worth the time. Anyways have fun watching the anime, it is really something.\nThanks. Hope this helps.\n        "},

All the characters and plots are connected somehow which makes it interesting to keep watching to solve more of the mysteries. I should warn you though. Pay attention to the year in which something takes place. I think I was too relaxed when I started watching resulting in it being like some characters where in multiple places at the same time.\nThe dialogue isn't\n          \n        particularly good and again, it's a bit difficult to follow when you start watching especially if you're not paying attention.

Deal with it.*\nI'm afraid to talk about the plot or the characters too much for fear of giving something away (this is the sort of series you could probably pick up something new in each time you watch it), but I can talk a little bit about its form: Baccano! spends most of its time in the years 1930-1933, with occasional excursions into the past (up to 200 years in the past) and one excursion into the early 2000s. Nearly all of the action takes place in America, and most of the\n          \n        characters are American--I wouldn't say that the depiction of America at this time is at all accurate, but the feel is right (the soundtrack and excellent scenery art certainly help). The series juggles three main plot strands (and their associated subplots), flashing among the three (with little regards for chronological storytelling) and often re-playing scenes through the perspectives of other characters. Whoever is responsible for figuring out how to put all of this together is a mad genius--the editing here is on the same level as quality it is in a film like Memento, though this series is much less formalist. This does mean that initially the series can be a bit overwhelming--the first 1 or 2 episodes may be enough to turn off some viewers, and it'll still be another few episodes before you've got a firm grip on who's who, what they're up to, how they're related to one another, and what's what.\nLuckily, the team behind this show make it easy to care; most of the primary characters are scoundrels, delinquents, criminals, murderers, and psychopaths--all of the most delightful kind. Like Tarantino's best work, you wind up rooting for nearly everyone--and the few that you're not rooting for are still a joy to watch. There are some truly unique characters to latch onto here as well--yes, this show deals heavily in tropes and anime stereotypes, but the expert manipulation of said tropes and stereotypes elevates a lot of the characters here above their counterparts in other anime--assuming that you've got a high tolerance for chaos. Only one character in this series truly grated on me--luckily, he doesn't appear until the last three episodes (14-16, technically a short OVA coda to the series). Even though none of the characters truly gets a lot of screen-time, you'll come away from the series with strong impressions of their personality--I don't know that they're well developed, but they are powerfully developed. \nThe only really bad thing I can say about Baccano! is that it doesn't know when to end. Most anime series spend maybe half of an episode on their denouement at most--Baccano! takes a full *three* episodes after the climax to wrap everything up. I suspect that many people would just be happier to stop watching after episode 13--there are still some unanswered questions and some nagging odds and ends left hanging, but the big payoffs of this episode are so rewarding that dragging the series out for too long after that only feels like it'll dull the edge. That said, these three episodes in and of themselves aren't bad--indeed, some of the reveals here are *really* gratifying, as is the way some minor characters make re-entrances and the writers sneak in some nice commentary on the nature of storytelling, but the attempt to introduce another villain so late in the game in order to provide some forward momentum really falls flat--especially when compared to the villains and set pieces of what's already come before. All said, it's not a bad ending really, but it is a let-down after everything that's come before. \nThat spot of negativity aside, this is a very goddamn accomplished anime, and is a blast to watch. Black comedy, over-the-top action, memorable characters, romance, intrigue; it's all here. And the plot involving the transcontinental train The Flying Pussyfoot (yep) provides one of the best extended set-pieces in anime history--believe me, you're not going to mind spending half of almost every episode on this train. I've never seen a gambit pileup as hilariously massive as what occurs on this train, in *anything.* Hugely recommended.\n        "},

Baccano! breaks from traditional storytelling methods in two primary ways. First, the majority of the story is presented in a stream of consciousness style, creating enough mystery and intrigue to keep the viewer guessing until the next episode, yet allows the viewer to piece together the events so that it still feels satisfying. \nSecondly, the main plot of the story is HEAVILY character driven, which would be problematic if the creators had reached into the stockpile of generic anime character types that seem to plague many series out there. Thankfully, this is not\n          \n        the case, as each individual character has their individual insecurities and character flaws exposed as well as their prominent traits displayed in the main story. One could easily imagine meeting somebody in the real world like the characters in this anime. \nA primary plot element of Baccano! has to do with immortality, and while this is not exactly a brand-new idea for anime, the manner in which the subject is handled is. Characters have a breadth of thoughts on the subject, ranging from the lamenting torture of the inability to die, to the joys of eternal youth, and even a distinction between immortality in a spiritual and physical sense. \nIn summary, this is a series that you would do a disservice to yourself by not seeing. \n        "},

This series, although more focused on gunfights between rival mafia families, still bases the origin of the plot with an alchemic experiment, much like that of Ed and Al's epic failure in recreating their mother without the loss of an appendage and a body or two. \n      If you're in to the inhuman combat scene in the world of manga and anime, this is probably the anime for you. Body parts flying everywhere, large amounts of gunfire, and all of those body parts flying back to their original owners. As well, the jazz in the background is pretty nice, although the tenor saxophone's growl in the opening theme is really, really cheesy. I personally enjoyed this anime a lot.

If you already watched Durarara!! which was made by the same author, you'll probably understand what I'm saying. This anime has lots, lots of cases, lots of characters, and lots of problems. That's okay, because in the end, they were all solved!\nBaccano! to me is a really complicated, one intriguing\n          \n        series. The main theme, delivering, and even story is all original and you wouldn't find anything similar to this except in another series made by the same author. This series is simply, magical. I especially love how different stories in the end could join as one, concluded as one, and nothing left behind. Well, we have some characters responsible for uniting those stories... and you'll find out after watching. The main plot to me is a kind of awesome, even though it's... like I said before, complicated. Lots of fights (or maybe gore?) and some scenes aren't just... suitable for younger viewers, I warn you guys. You'll see blood splatter, those evil laugh, torturing, and things that are sooo scary that at some point you would pee your pants (or is it just me?). But aside of those frightening scenes... even Baccano! has some romantic, sweet points. Not gonna spoil, just go and watch!!\nAnd how the story was told is what amazed me the most. Like DRRR (this might be Narita's style in telling stories), this series isn't quite chronological. I mean, sometimes we could fly to two years later, or maybe go back two years earlier, and then go a year later, so on. Because lots of different stories are being told and those stories are on different time span, that's what happen to you; time going back and forth. It may be so confusing at some moments but believe me, when you keep on watching, you'll understand everything. In the end, everything is one, and one is everything. The past tale might have some relation to the later occurrences. What you should do is not complaining; just watch and use your head sometimes to think.\nAs I stated before... the violence might be too tense to some watchers, but I think that's one of this story's great aspect. I mean, it was awesome. Seriously. At some points you might want to puke, but.... hang in there! Even Baccano! has some funny moments.\nThe art is clean and simple, but I think it was ok. Once again, the violence were awesome.\nSound... what to say? This anime doesn't have much of a soundtrack... but well.\nCharacters! We have lots of characters here. And the story doesn't just revolve around one character, it's eeeeverybody's story! I especially like Baccano's moodmaker, the most amusing duo Isaac-Miria (they even appeared in DRRR lolll). The characters are varied. Well, characters' are what makes the story whole. And I love Baccano's characters.\nOverall enjoyment is awesome. Maybe you'll get confused on timing the scene right, or maybe you'll get lost at which scene happened first, then this scene, etc. But it's, once again, ok!! Everything is going to be explained in the end. Or maybe you'll get to understand as the story is still going.\nSo, what are you waiting for? If you're looking for a dark, mysterious mafia-based anime, this is the right choice!\n        "},

I'm not going to tell you about the extreme violence and scary-crazy people, but rather, how confusing it can get.\nI loved it, I really did, but because it jumps back and forth through a couple of years (i.e. it can go from 1932 to 1931 and back to 1932 in one episode) it can really get you confused. You see things happening, but your mind struggles to put it into chronological order. However, most of it makes sense at about episode 13.\nBecause we watch anime, it\n          \n        mus mean that our purpouse is to neglect most if not all work that is surrounding us at the moment, so I doubt any of you will pick up a paper and pen to note the events to help you out. There is another way of better keeping up, however. You can read online about the jist of the show to help you out some. Trust me, it won't spoil it while you're watching it.\nWell, I'm not going to go into any more details. I need to watch AGAIN before I fully comprehend it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Here's the deal.\nIf you're looking for an anime that'll get you thinking, or an anime you can watch to settle down before bedtime, you'd be better off with something like Mushishi. If you want a considerably well-crafted rollercoaster ride, Baccano is right here waiting for you.\nThe main asset of any anime is its characters. Baccano is a particularly impressive example of a good set of characters, ranging from complete maniacs (Ladd Russo) to Jessie-and-James-soundalikes (Isaac and Miria) to strangely relatable pussies (Jacuzzi Splot). Not all of them are good guys - a few of them are complete arseholes - but they're all well constucted and\n          \n        bounce off of each other awesomely. I could talk about each one and their place in the series in general, but there are SO GOD DAMN MANY characters that I wouldn't know where to even start, so I'm moving on.\nIn terms of art and animation, it's solid. It's no lavish visual maverick, like Gankutsuou, but it's vivid and rich enough to be a good counterpoint to the events taking place.\nAs for the elephant in the room... you'd be better off with the dub. It just feels way more natural to hear American voice actors performing American roles. It's one of those rare few dubs that's always brought up to defend dubs in those ubiquitous \"sub-v-dub\" arguments, and for good reason. It's often considered one of the best dubs of all time. It's not like I'd disagree or anything ^_^  \nThe story is notorious for its wonky presentation. To avoid spoilers, the majority of Baccano takes place on one locomotive, in which many events take place around the same time. To cover all of this, the point of view switches from character to character, not always in chronological order, revealing more and more aspects of the plot with every episode. Some have called it confusing. I call it brilliant. It keeps secrets from you, leaving you wondering what certain characters' motivations are, then revealing them by the next episode while managing to make you ask even MORE questions, only for those to be revealed.\nBaccano is loud, fast and fun. It's not particularly intellectual, but that's fine because it isn't trying to be. It's no Elfen Lied, an anime that shoots for depth of character and narrative that simply ends up as manipulative. It's designed around enjoyment, pure and simple. Considering that, the amount of memorable characters, unique method of storytelling and impressive historical accuracies all make this series one of the most solid series ever made. \n(also unless you hate jazz the soundtrack is really good too!!!!!!)\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    All aboard the Flying Pussyfoot! The greatest name for a train in history.\nBaccano! is an interesting series. It is unique in several categories; the story primarily takes place in America, constantly changing it's narrative to focus on the years 1930, 1931, 1932, and even 1711. None of the characters are Japanese, with all of them being European and American. Featuring immortals, gangsters, and some sweet jazz music, the story's narrative direction is also one of it's unique, finer points.\nThe first episode is confusing. It introduces a lot ands shows many scenes throughout the story in flashes, as the \"narrator\" of sorts discusses with a little\n          \n        girl about story-telling and characters in general. They even discuss whom the main character is, but there really isn't one. The dozen or so characters that the story is concentrated on each play their own part.\nThat may make one wonder if the story lacks narrative direction or focus, but it doesn't. The series jumps from one character or a group of characters from one year to the next constantly without disrupting it's rhythm or flow. Their actions overlap fluidly within the narrative structure, and the unique way in which the tale is told by switching between characters and years keeps suspense high, and the \"Aha!\" moments to the maximum. You'll be on the edge of your seat as more details come in and the story reaches it's climax.\nBaccano! is not without it's faults. However sadly, these faults come primarily from some action sequences, almost entirely on Ladd, Claire, and Chane. They defy all human expectations as they block shotgun blasts with knives, dodge sniper bullets, kick guns out of someone else's hand, and do backflips on top of a moving train. These quixotic moments are grating by the end of the series and will unfortunately will put you right back into your living room. In those moments of disbelief the show becomes nothing more than a mildly entertaining popcorn flick. By contrast, the immortal characters are perfectly fine, because they have a set of rules to go along with that power, making them balanced. Ladd, Claire, and Chane however, are untouchable demi-gods, for no reason other than to make action sequences that suspend disbelief.\nThe story itself, with the exception of those action sequences, holds up in it's own right. There aren't glaring plot holes and the large group of characters are unique. Although some of the cast don't get much development at all in this short 13 episode series, they don't necessarily need to either. Each character fills their own role in the story perfectly.\nYet none of those problems take away from what Baccano! already does exceptionally well. It's narrative direction is already fantastic, and it's aided by superb art and classic jazz music. Even despite originally airing in 2007, the art holds up fantastically, even a decade later. The classy jazz music that plays on occasion helps make the time period and characters feel real. \nThere was a time when Baccano! was my favorite anime. It still holds a place close to my heart, but overdramatized action sequences are ultimately it's detriment, just preventing it from being remembered as a masterpiece. I'd still highly recommend the series to any anime fan who can stomach the blood and gore, just don't go in expecting something deep that will leave you thinking about it for a long time. \n        "},
