Okay, so he's mostly reformed. However, strict administrators and a class of ruthless delinquents stand between Onizuka and his goal and they will use any means, however illegal or low, to drive the new teacher away. Perfect, because Onizuka's methods won't be found in any teaching manual; he cares about the difference between legal and illegal activities about as much as he cares for the age difference between himself and a high school girl. So get ready for math that doesn't add up, language you'd be slapped for using, and biology that would make a grown man blush... unless of course, you're the Great Teacher Onizuka.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=461,  ["text"]="\n                          \n    I was a little skeptical at first about this anime.  I usually avoid the comedy/slice-of-life genre, but this anime came highly recommended by an old friend and boy am I glad I listened to him.  GTO has to be one of the most well made anime package of its time.\nThe story is somewhat cliche: troublesome high school students with peculiar skills or traits trying to rid a teacher who's trying hard to to teach them a lesson in life.  However, there are some very clever surprises and plot devices to keep the viewer poised for more.  My only complaint is the\n          \n        rather hashed season finale (Ep. 42 and 43), but that was to be expected since those are the only two episodes that didn't diligently follow the manga.\nThe animation is adequate for its time, but that isn't the reason why you should watch this.\nBoth the opening and ending soundtrack for the series is great.  Although, neither are as good as the GTO Live Action theme, 'Poison'.  \nThe reason why you should watch this is simple: Onizuka Ekikichi, 22 years, virgin.  This anime is all about character, rather a character.  Truly GTO is ineffable in that sense.  Watch the first episode and tell me if you're not immediately enamored by Onizuka and his ridiculous ways. \nWhile there is a certain moral message to the anime, watch it for the sheer fun value.  It will make you laugh, that's for certain, perhaps it might even make you cry.  The live action series, I'm not ashamed to say did make my eyes wet.  \nThe live action series (12 episodes) is quite good as well but there are certain things one can have liberty with in an anime that is not possible in live action.\nOverall, I highly recommend GTO.  Not just the anime but the entire franchise, manga, live action TV series and the movie.\nGreat Teacher Onizuka Banzai!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=276,  ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Eikichi Onizuka. 22 years old. Even as Japan keeps turning out more new anime, there’s still perfectly good series out there from the past, and that’s especially true for people who might have been introduced to anime just recently. It’s hard to believe that GTO will be 10 years old this June, but age has nothing to do with a good anime. So I’ve devoted the last few days of my life to this series.\nThe premise is simple, if not a bit cracked out, and the first episode serves to illustrate. Onizuka is a former Yakuza who always had a dream of becoming a teacher,\n          \n        and the best one of all time at that. Of course, he ends up drawing quite possibly the most ill-tempered class out of the whole lot, and that’s putting it lightly. This begins a 42 episode long trek to slowly win all students of his class over, and along the way figure out their problems. And in the end, it culminates with the student who has easily suffered the most trauma and the revelation of the event that shook the class to its core.\nYou know Onizuka’s always going to win in the end, and if you have to ask why, then you still don’t quite understand the premise. What’s important is the journey, how is he going to prevail, and where is he going to screw up along the way. It seems easy but quickly becomes complicated when you realize that the class is actively plotting against his efforts. They’re quite brilliant for a bunch of teenagers. The vice-principal also has a very low opinion of the former gang member and spends a lot of his time antagonizing the situation. On top of that, Onizuka is no pristine member of society; in fact, he’s a wonderfully flawed character. He drinks, he smokes, he’s vulgar, he’s a womanizer, and he acts completely over the top, running on instinct. Despite this you will love him, trust me.\nThe cast of characters supporting the show are just as important; they are numerous and just as easily flawed. If you’re anything like me, you’ll have trouble remembering most of their names by the end of the series, even the ones that are around from step one. Yet, each of these characters gets to carry the plot ball at some point for their spot in the limelight, and most of them will even have their own crowning moment of awesome. By the end, they’ve all grown significantly under their teacher’s tutelage. It’s the sign of a good series when you can juggle all these characters around and manage to leave none of them in the lurch.\nA lot of the series appeal is the ridiculous situations that are generated and Onizuka’s ability to come up with equally ridiculous solutions, and soak up comical levels of punishment. It still delivers elsewhere. This show has the ability to move you, and if you don’t feel anything by the end of episode 11’s dramatic soliloquy, quite frankly you must be dead inside. The great teacher also specializes in life lessons, and if you haven’t managed to learn anything by the time the series reaches its conclusion, then I honestly wonder if we were watching the same show. This naturally lends itself to exploring how the school system is failing to prepare its students for the real world, instead focusing on test scores at the expense of all else. Really the only time this show loses its impact at all are when it veers off the overarching story for a one shot episode, and even those don’t feel terribly out of place and serve as auxiliary character development.\nThe animation isn’t nearly as pristine as technology allows today. It’s still fun the watch, and the facial expressions in particular are well executed. There’s a lot of action going on in some sequences, and there isn’t any major animation break or loss of what’s going on. The music doesn’t have a tremendous amount of variety; it sets the mood for the situation and then goes merrily away, letting the characters speak for themselves. Steven Blum plays Onizuka to the hilt, and I like the rest of the characters voice work as well for the most part. There were a couple of minor characters I didn’t really care for, but a minor character in this series basically means they get about three lines and then fall off the face of the planet for a few years.\nThis series is full of greatness. If you haven’t watched it yet, then I don’t care how you do it, watch it. If you have, take a bit of your time to revisit your favorite episodes. It’ll be worth it for all of you.\n        "},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=261,  ["text"]="                          \n    Great Teacher Onizuka had some potential, but all of the humor is repetitive and juvenile, while unrealistic dramatic scenes dominate the plot more and more as the series drags on. It basically fails on both fronts. Plot points and devices are reused to the point where they become dull, and they get increasingly ridiculous as the series progresses. Not in a good way, of course. Holy melodrama, batman! This anime is chock full of bullshit backstories that are supposed to make us go “awwwwww, they’re not a bad guy/girl after all!” by the way. Yeah, it’s definitely as irritating and ineffective as it sounds. \n\nCharacter\n          \n        development is unfortunately absent from the personality of our bland douche of a protagonist, and he is pretty much the same annoying dumbass for the whole duration of the plot. His way of solving issues with students is completely unrealistic, and while this is sometimes acknowledged and played for laughs, it takes itself seriously far too often. He’s pretty much just there for wish-fulfillment, plain and simple. As for his students, all developments in them come off as completely forced and contrived. Plus, almost all of them are blatant archetypes, who have some deep-seated reason to “bawww nvr trust a teacher again!” to boot. Why should we care about anything bad that threatens to happen when we already know that the Mary Sue genius cool handsome hacker boy can fix all problems that come up easily? Another telling issue with the characterization is that just about all men above the age of twenty are, for whatever reason, portrayed as disgusting perverts. This may be a reflection on Fujisawa himself, given the large amount of poorly-placed fanservice. All antagonists in this series start off completely one-dimensional and unrealistically evil, but they then get some sob-story tacked onto their character and their personality changes completely. That is simply not proper character development.\n\nThe art is easily the weakest aspect. Almost everybody has the same exact face; you know, that one face that Fujisawa Tohru recycles endlessly in everything he does. The only face he knows how to draw, basically. Great Teacher Onizuka largely depends on visual humor for its value as a comedy, but all of the \"hilarious\" facial expressions were used over and over again, when they were never really funny in the first place. At the same time, they contribute heavily to my inability to take Great Teacher Onizuka seriously. The rest of the visual humor is just somewhat lame and, man, I hope you like seeing Onizuka’s ass, because you’re going to be getting a lot of that. The animation is nothing special, and any flaws with it are completely overshadowed by the horrendous art. \n\nAll of the claims made by Great Teacher Onizuka’s rabid defenders about its “societal commentary” are completely untrue. Bullying is not dealt with much better, more interestingly, or realistically than in many other works I have seen. Furthermore, I failed to see what it actually criticized about the education system, other than the fact that not enough teachers are violent gangsters. This theme continues with just about everything else it supposedly comments on. It either just features these things in a cliché manner or does not really say much about them at all. There is no depth to Great Teacher Onizuka; it is just a simple drama and comedy. This would be fine did it do either of those things right, but, alas, it did not. \n\nI have no idea as to why this anime is so highly regarded. It is just not very good, plain and simple. I get second-hand embarrassment when watching all of those sentimental scenes about teaching, and then I have to wonder why Great Teacher Onizuka didn’t just stick to comedy. Then I remember that it wasn’t funny and I think to myself “ah, that explains it.” GTO started out as a decent parody of all of those stupid shows with a super-teacher who helps his students work out all of their problems and wins their hearts in the process, but it eventually fell victim to self-indulgence and became a stupid story in the same vein. It contributed nothing new nor anything of real value to the genres of school life, comedy, or drama. It never made me laugh out loud, and it never evoked any kind of physical or emotional response. Not in a good way, at least. At its best, it’s okay. At its worst, it’s goddamn painful. "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=207,  ["text"]="                          \n    I finished this series a while back but i was bored so i decided to write this..\nWhat happens when you take a situation comedy, a schoolyard farce, and a stiff shot of hard-hitting commentary on modern youth and the issues facing the Japanese educational system, mix them together in one anime series, and shake vigorously? You get something wonderful, and that something is called GTO. The series tempers itself with a grounding in reality and addresses serious social issues, but by mixing raunchy humor with a bit of an edge, Onizuka's lovable-loser-with-attitude persona, and a collection of wild situations that any prime-time comedy would be\n          \n        proud to sport, GTO distinguishes itself as a creative, enjoyable, and very funny show. \nAt first, I wasn't quite sure what to make of GTO; the sexual themes come on pretty strong, and between Onizuka's skirt-chasing and torturing his students, this didn't look to be a series in very good taste. Actually, I was missing the point: GTO is less a schoolyard drama and more like a modern-day fairy tale about a very human knight in all-too tarnished armor, fighting against conformity and the \"right\" way to do things. Once I stopped taking it too seriously, I started having an absolutely grand time. \nThe characters are what make almost every good anime comedy work and GTO is no exception, featuring an unusually broad range of minor players. With everything from anime-standard biker-gang members to much more normal folks like Onizuka's used car dealer friend and an assortment of dysfunctional parental relationships, the characters run the gamut from broad stereotypes and hilarious anime favorites to surprisingly realistic everyday folk. What stands out in particular, though, are the kids that Onizuka has to deal with--far from the stereotypical blushing anime schoolgirls, the majority of these normal-seeming kids are world-wise and have a vicious streak that can be downright scary, particularly since their tactics are rarely as simple as mere violence. Aside from being a sadly accurate reflection of modern Japan, it does make for an interesting change of pace, as does Onizuka's less than conventional methods of dealing with them. \nThis eclectic collection allows for plenty of humorous situations while also providing the serious ones that give the series its emotional heart. At the center of all of them, however, is none other than the Great Teacher himself, and Onizuka Eikichi is, more than anything, what makes GTO as much fun as it is. \nOnizuka at first may look like a simple skirt chaser, but there's oh-so-much-more to him than your average skirt-chasing creep, even though the TV version has less character development than in the comics. On one hand, his main interest in teaching seems to be the (female) students (and fellow teachers, for that matter), and he's certainly got a wandering eye, summed up in a hilarious scene early on where he surveys a schoolyard filled entirely with high school girls--the pan was captioned with \"There are boys, but he only sees the girls.\" On the other, he's a hard-driving Karate champ badass with plenty of biker gang leader attitude to back it up. In between, he's an emotionally fragile loser with no life, less social skills, a good heart, and an honest desire to give kids a better educational experience than he had. \nIf you put it all together, you get a dirty-minded punk who's not too bright, but can't help being a good guy from time to time, and more importantly he's one heckuva funny guy to watch. The most memorable (and funny) moments in the series revolve around Onizuka's unending capacity to absolutely freak out--aside from a variety of near breakdowns we're treated to sudden interjections of Onizuka's flights of fancy, usually offset immediately afterwards by harsh reality. He also seems to get that his interest in the students isn't exactly a good thing (but amusingly hard to resist), and his violent outbursts and \"unorthodox\" (read: \"Suplex!\") methods aren't something he's necessarily proud of later--he just gets carried away from time to time, and violence is the only way he knows how to solve things. Fortunately for him, his unique style is just what some of the kids he meets up with need, and his determination, street-earned wisdom, and bottomless idiocy are enough to make it work. \nAlthough things settle into more situation-comedy territory once the series is well underway, the early plot of GTO looks like a classic--a teacher who really isn't comes into the \"tough class\" and busts some heads, whipping the students into shape and earning their respect in the process. But unlike the action movies that make the rounds on late-night cable, GTO brings together wacky anime-style sensibilities, an edgy sense of humor, and enough meaningful drama and social commentary to keep things plenty interesting in one confidently directed episode after another. The more dramatic scenes are sometimes a little on the stereotypical side, but were still well handled and at times surprisingly powerful, and more importantly the series never seems to take itself too seriously--it's all one big romp in the end. Perhaps most impressive of all was how comfortably the series flowed; the episodes effortlessly weave between drama and outright slapstick, and each has a lively pace that keeps you wanting more but never feels the least bit hurried. \nGTO was not without flaws, though even the worst of them was only minor for me. My biggest problem was with the dub, but I'll cover that later. More generally, I was bothered by some of the art; the series is stylistically similar to adult male-targeted \"businessman\" manga (artists like Ikegami Ryoichi), which was most noticeable in Onizuka's frequently exaggerated facial expressions. I personally find that particular style of exaggeration unpleasant to look at more than funny, but in this case the situations were good enough that I was more than willing to forgive once I got used to it, and I wasn't even noticing after a half dozen episodes. \nThe only other fundamental complaint that comes to mind is with some of the rather dirty-minded subject material; those sensitive to that sort of thing, particularly as it relates to student-teacher relationships, might not be able to see past it. The first two-part episode in particular featured several scenes that seemed to pander to the male portion of the audience that thinks the same way as Onizuka does, but it didn't really bother me. In fact, that was probably the best way to establish his character (and to snag a TV audience), and as long as you don't take it seriously it should all be very funny (Akemi, to offer one female viewpoint, didn't find it offensive at all). In any case the rest of the series isn't all like that, though it doesn't lose its edge either, and it's all tempered by dealing with some real (and often related) social issues. \nThe artistic style is, as I mentioned, in the same general vein as a lot of other manga series aimed at older males. This means that the characters tend more toward realistic faces and proportions, although in this case the influence is mostly visible in the exaggerated facial expressions. Even so, there is still a wide variety of character looks, made even more impressive by the fact that they all look, more or less, Japanese. Even Onizuka's blonde hair is pointed out as being dyed, and is a distinctive part of his rebel character. The backgrounds tend to be rather bland, but if anything that puts more focus on the antics of the characters. The animation, at least, is smooth enough, and the character animation was extremely expressive, not to mention very funny. \nThe background music consists of a variety of amusing mood-enhancing tunes, and the intro and end themes were decent modern selections. The first season's intro animation, by the way, is the most artistically creative part of the production--an edgy, hard-edged, black and white montage of scenes capturing Onizuka's bad-boy persona. \nNow for the one thing that made or broke GTO: The acting. Let's start with the Japanese, which is, in a word, perfect. The casting and acting in the variety of bit players is funny, but Takagi Wataru truly put the Great in GTO. Covering everything from mildly dramatic to ultra-stud to bad boy to blubbering idiot to near-breakdown hysterics, the quality with which every single facet of Onizuka's personality is portrayed was absolutely brilliant. I rarely heap praise that freely, but Takagi's performance alone was worth the price of admission. The subtitles, incidentally, were translated quite accurately, though the English is a bit stiff and does a poor job of capturing just how rough Onizuka's dialogue is. \nThe dub is an entirely different matter. Serious creative liberties were taken with the translation, which I was willing to forgive since the dialogue was fairly witty and had some modern flair, although much of it also seemed to be noticeably more gross. More importantly, though, David Lucas's take on Onizuka just wasn't great. Not that there was anything wrong with it, but his range wasn't particularly broad, so much of the humor in the series was based on his antics, and Onizuka's Japanese voice was so good, that anything less than a truly amazing performance would have felt like a major letdown. Slightly choppy directing may have also contributed to this. \nI'm an established sub fan, so maybe I'm being too harsh on the dub, but what I found particularly interesting was how much less funny the English version was. Part of it was the acting, a little bit was due to choppy writing, a little more came from the fact that the background music and sound effects were quieter in relation to the dialogue, which drained some of the mood out of several scenes, but more than anything the English version just felt more... embarrassing. Maybe it's just in my head, but it seemed to me that the combination of less broad acting, less noticeable music, and somewhat more crude dialogue gave the whole production a less silly feel, which in turn made Onizuka's behavior less funny and more distasteful. Perhaps I'm reading too much into it, but at least I'm confident in saying that the Japanese version is much funnier than the dub. \nAll in all, GTO is not a wildly original series, but like some of the best modern anime it takes tried and true concepts, gives them a good, hard shake, and shoots in a stiff dose of fresh, funny attitude to create a thoroughly enjoyable show. It's definitely not appropriate for younger viewers, and it's going to appeal more to the older male fans, but if you give GTO a chance, almost anyone who enjoys some mature (and relatively intelligent) but silly fun with should have a grand time. Personally, I can't get enough.\n"},

A really original and good anime filled with comedy, action, and a few serious moments, an animation that has given life to one of the most memorable characters i've seen, Onizuka Eichi.\nThe animation is good, different from what you see elswhere but fits just right with the mood the show aims to give you, the funny faces Onizuka or Uchiyamada make are a real blast of comedy, ones i can always remember and still laugh about.\nThe sound is great, great voice acting from everybody and a really cool soundtrack. Just watch the OP theme\n          \n        and you'll see what i mean, and later on the second OP/ED themes become even cooler. Maybe the best themes i've came across till now.\nThe story? funny, action packed and exagerated, really exagerated, i don't think students in Japan can be that bad even if they think they only get betrayed by their teacher... but this exageration gives birth to a really hilarious anime with some serious parts that concern the teacher-student relationship, all seen through the eyes of a very different and incredibile teacher Onizuka, an ex-bike gang leader who wants to be the mentor and teacher that he never had. And what sorts of things can happen in a school? you have no idea untill you watch this semi-episodic story... you can't really categorize this anime, it doesn't really look like something you've sen till now...\nThe Characters? Onizuka is the coolest character ever, the ex-bike gang leader with dyed hair and ear rings and muscles, tough and careless and always looking for fun on the outside, but with a big heart, trust in people and responsability on the inside... i'm shure any school student would give anything to have a teacher like him. Or the schools Uchiyamada-Sensei... hahah what a funny character. And Murai, Urumi, The PE Teacher, Kukuchi or Anko just make a great character cast.\nThe only thing that i want out of it is a sequel, they could add one since the ending doesn't really look like an ending, not the ending i wanted... so that's why i'm gonna give the story a 9 instead of a 10... because of the ending.\nHow can you call yourself an anime fan if you didn't see GTO? this is a real classic, different from everything you've saw till now, the perfect combination between action, fun, coolness and deepness... Just watch the first episode and i bett you would want to watch it all.\n        "},

Don\'t read stupid reviews, like mine. Just go there,buy the DVD set and start watching it!\nOverall-&gt; oustanding! why ? hehe, yosh! I\'ll explain...\nI\'ve just completed the TV episodes and the enjoyment afterall is great. A superb comedy plotline -&gt; not-ordinary guy(a former Gang member) who\'s teaching hard-time kids as their Homeroom Teacher. Well it\'s nothing special about the \'set\', but it\'s just perfect for comedy plotline. And when i say comedy\n          \n        i really mean it! 43 episodes of Hearty laugh!!!! The hilarious situations Onizuka\'s falling are so funny that you literally will 'roll on the floor laughing'!!! And finally the outcome is really a  'life-teaching' for the students. A comedy, followed by wise advices for the life!! \nThese advices are given by Great Teacher Onizka,22 years old, bachalor. The records for Onizuka are really funny -&gt; the basics are simple - powerfull ex-gang member, not qualified enough for teaching but makes astonishing contact with his students. Onizuka has really deep involvement with their life-problems. Oustanding score for development the characters and their emotional relationship!. \nLet\'s go to the \'sound\'. The both openings are near perfect! The songs are really really good, even now i\'am listening Driver\'s High! Great job for L\'arc-en-ciel and Porno Graffiti!!!! But i don\'t like the endings... They\'re depressing me, for a comedy of this high level they should be more full-of-life ^_^\nLets don\'t stop on the art for too long. There\'s nothing special in it. It\'s Good enough! Nothing bad at the animation and nothing so good to rise the score up. It\'s good enough to represent the funny story :) The real funny story indeed! There aren\'t philosophical twists in the plotline. Everything is perfectly and well made, simple to follow and enough hilarious to stop breathing from laugh. And really - in some moment your stomach muscles will hurt from laughing!! The story is oustanding from every point of view - slice of life,comedy,drama ... EVERYTHING! :D The major aspects in the story are easy to define - hard time for Onizuka who\'s trying to become 'Great Teacher' in Tokyo.... With that comes the laughtable situations :D\nIt\'s 'MUST WATCH' title!!!!!! \n\n"},

It's the story and the characters that shine though. the jokes are spot on, the running gags are spot on, and the lessons  he teaches his students are just amazing!

		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=27,   ["text"]="                          \n    Animation - 7\n  Ehh, not much to say, for a show that is as action-packed as Great Teacher Onizuka is, it relies heavily on terrible CG anachronistic for its time, and flashes of still frames with speed lines and directional slashes galore.  The character design is kind of uninspired, yet executed very well.  The most interesting thing visually about this show is the fantastically conceived opening.\nSound - 6\n  The same goes for the sound in this show.  Out of the entire cast, only two voices stand out as well done, that being of Onizuka, and his student, Kunio.  The\n          \n        first theme song is undeniably fun and sets a good tone, but the subsequent op and all of the ed are quite forgettable.  \nStory - 6\n  The tale is familiar, teacher comes in and changes the lives of his impossible students for the better, inspiring them to have goals and live happily.  However, given the character of Eikichi Onizuka, this story is infused with undeniable shounen ecchiness that fans of such genres would find irresistible.  Each arc focuses on one of Onizuka's students and how he manages to sway their notions of how a teacher acts, thereby instilling his trust in them.  While these arcs progress, the overall narrative painting a picture of Eikichi, the man, slowly comes to the fore.  Actually in retrospect, while I found the show quite formulaic, and very predictable, the story is well crafted, and decently paced.\nCharacters - 6\n  Well, this show, like many others has its parade of overused stereotypes...blonde guy with a kansai-ben, check, 'perfect' love interest, check, dumb bobble head, check, glasses guy, check, diva bitch, check, angry gag man, check.  I could go on, but I'll stop there.  To me, the show didn't really excel in creating characters that felt distinguishable from any other in their type group, and instead tried to rely on the comedy to make them likable, so for me, I only found Kunio an enjoyable character, since, for whatever reason I don't understand, I find these bleached-blonde misfits to be hilarious.  Interestingly enough though, I didn't find Onizuka to be charismatic, likable, or comedically enjoyable at all.  I found him much too annoying, and much of his actions far too perverted even with the mantra of 'willing suspension of disbelief.'  He was just a flatly outrageous character with no depth.\nEnjoyment - 6\n  Any scene with Kunio was enjoyable to me, so I especially liked the little arc that he had towards the end...even if it didn't really have to do with him.  Other than that it was pretty unfulfilling.\nOverall - 6\n  Overall, I give the show a 6.  Though the narrative was well-crafted, the show was very shallow and could have easily been done with probably 10 less episodes.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=24,   ["text"]="                          \n    If I had a teacher like Onizuka I would actually have enjoyed school and looked forward to attending every day. The show itself is good but he makes it great. For those of you who have yet to watch it, please let me try and convince you with a short review to give it a try. This is my review.\nContains Minor Spoilers\nStory\nThe story of GTO concerns Eikichi Onizuka, a reformed biker gang leader that strives to be a great teacher and meet chicks. The story of the teacher that reforms delinquents has been done countless times but the story of GTO feels fresh. For one,\n          \n        instead of taking place in a lower class public school district, the students are of a higher class with wealthy parents. And Onizuka doesn’t come from the same privileged and sophisticated background as his students and this provides an interesting comedic dynamic. The story has a few heartfelt moments that’s scattered throughout the show. The only complaint I have the with the story is that it began to feel repetitive near the end with the same “Onizuka wants to turn student’s life around but student hates Onizuka” formula being used over and over again.  \nArt\nThe art style looks really 90’s from the character designs to the background and it fits the style and tone of the show like a glove. Onizuka has one of the most flexible faces you’ll see and it provides a lot of laughs on its own. Watch the second opening and try not to laugh when Onizuka gives the finger, I dare you.\nSound\nSteven Blum is fantastic. He gives Onizuka an inherent goofiness and likeability but also makes him come off as cool, menacing and bad ass. However some of the voice actors sound off and don’t really sound natural. One of the students talks with a surfer accent and sometimes it’s so bad that you end up laughing. The show has one of the best soundtracks you’ll hear. Both openings of the show are excellent. Upbeat rock songs that you’ll want to listen to over and over again.\nCharacters\nEikichi Onizuka is well known among members of the anime community for a reason. He’s funny, vulgar and caring. He looks after his students and never gives up on them. His methods can be unorthodox and he does a lot of things real teachers would never do but that just shows how far he would go for his pupils. Since Onizuka wants to help his learners throughout the story expect a lot of character development. The supporting characters are well developed but they are not nearly entertaining as Onizuka with the exception of vice principal Uchiyamada.\nEnjoyment\nGTO is amazing. It has a lead that’s impossible to hate, a really fun soundtrack and a funny and dramatic story, even if it does start to lag during the second half.\n8/10\n"},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="                          \n    Brace for shock as I attempt a new review of an older series given the new MAL review layout… Eek!\nGreat Teacher Onizuka.  An inherent amount of nostalgia runs through my veins watching this anime.  It was definitely a series highly regarded by my friends back in the day, and I had watched bits and pieces of it along the way.  It’s often hailed as one of the pinnacle comedy series of all time, and I thought it deserved a watch to see if it could stand the test of time.  I will be blunt, the comedy is good in this show…\n          \n        but there isn’t much else going for it.  Luckily, the comedy makes up such a large part of the anime that its other blemishes can be overlooked by most people.\nThe story in GTO is a unique one for sure.  Eikichi Onizuka is a 22 year old ex-biker gang leader horn dog who, for some unknown reason decides to venture into the world of teaching.  Easily overlooked by most schools for his outlandish and deviant behavior, Onizuka lands a job teaching at Holy Forest Academy… which just so happens to be a school that often looks past a hire’s credentials and resume.  Obviously given how eccentric Onizuka’s demeanor tends to be, the teachers are not all on board and dismiss his teaching style, and of course he ends up in a class teaching students notorious for harassing their teachers.  The first element made known here in GTO is the comedy.  Some of Onizuka’s escapades are utterly ridiculous and include anything from dressing up in a giant elephant costume to taking students to a beauty contest for a field trip.  The jokes are plentiful and kept me entertained, but there’s only so much comedy that can keep the average viewer entertained for a lengthy 43 episodes.\nThroughout his time at Holy Forest, Onizuka’s students try plan after devious plan to get him fired.  He incurs everything from posting scandalous cropped pictures of him all over school to trying to frame him as a panty thief.  These acts cause Onizuka a great deal of trouble but they all seem the same in the end.  It kind of goes like this: Student sets Onizuka up, he discovers a troubled backstory for said student, students plan backfires and Onizuka comes in to rescue them in either the figurative or literal sense, ultimately earning their trust and respect.  Rinse, repeat and there you have the entirety of the anime.  There isn’t a whole lot more to the story.  Each plan to foil him becomes more large scale with bigger consequences, but Onizuka always finds a way to come out on top.  Some of the back stories for the students seem relatively unrealistic or convenient at times, and I actually had a hard time believing any student could want a teacher to get fired that badly, I mean wouldn’t the school have at least broken them up?\nThere is a potential romance element thrown in as well with fellow teacher Fuyutsuki, and although several hints are dropped concerning its progression, it never really comes full circle.  It’s actually kind of frustrating.  There is a slight redemption with the story in regards to the many morals that could be extracted from the episodes, but I’m not really sure people are watching GTO for this reason.  Also, the many nefarious acts that occur on school grounds are incredible.  There’s no way in a school system’s right mind that a teacher like Onizuka would be allowed to spank the panty-ed butts of 3 underage girls and get away with it.  Or maybe that’s just 1990’s Japan… who knows?\nOnizuka is clearly the center of attention in this anime.  I would argue that the rest of the characters are entirely irrelevant.  He’s hilarious, perverted, belligerent and caring for people all at the same time.  He is clearly one of the most iconic and memorable characters in anime history, with his ability to adapt to and overcome any obstacle or scenario and making you laugh along the way.  He definitely has his own way of doing things, and although you may not realize at the time he has a very good reason for acting the way he does.  I just love the wide variety of expressions you see emblazoned on Onizuka’s face throughout the course of the anime.  Some of them made me legitimately laugh out loud.  You can even tell how he grows as a character in the series, earning the trust of his students and faculty, eventually becoming the self-proclaimed “Great Teacher Onizuka” he wished for from the start.\nCharacter development is lacking for the rest of the cast however.  The students in Onizuka’s class each play out their basic character tropes; the badass punk with his cronies (Murai), the nerd (Kikuchi), the introvert (Yoshikawa) and the brainless beauty (Tomoko).  There are a lot more, but I feel with the exception of Murai and the genius and mischievous Kanzaki, there wasn’t a lot of growth in character to go around.  One character I absolutely couldn’t stand was Miss Fuyutsuki, whose naivety and blind faith in Onizuka was unbelievable at best.  I will say that the conversion of Onizuka’s class from being against him to being at his side was paced well, but still felt implausible.\nGiven that this anime released in 1998, there aren’t a lot of bad things I can say about the art.  Character models look standard for late nineties animes, and the backgrounds were colorful and detailed to the necessary level.  I never felt like it lacked in any fashion, but nothing particularly jumped out at me either.  Both OP were well constructed, and contained a slightly different animation style to them than the actual show demonstrated.  I more preferred the first opening in the black and white style, but that’s just me.  Voice acting was undoubtedly great with the talents of Stephen Blum (watched in English), and I could sense some other famous voices among the cast but none necessarily stood out.  Some of the student’s voice acting was kind of bad though, almost cringe-worthy.  The soundtrack was vibrant and fit the anime well, although the ED landed as the stereotypical slow melodic tune with faces splattered in the background.\nEven though I won’t be ranking it up among my favorites of all time, I honestly enjoyed the heck out of GTO.  Onizuka’s ridiculous antics were incredibly entertaining to watch, and it was enough to keep me binge watching the entire series in 4 days.  It is rare for an anime to have me laugh out loud but GTO did it on numerous occasions.  It will be a series I could re-watch for the comedic relief alone and one that I won’t soon forget.\nIn conclusion, Great Teacher Onizuka is a fun anime with one of the most memorable characters to date.  Although not without its flaws and how it can be overrated, the things GTO does, it does very well.  The series may have fared a bit better if it were around 26 episodes vice 43, but I didn’t necessarily feel burnt out when the anime concluded.  I would recommend GTO to pretty much anyone, unless you are against older animation style or a good laugh.  Thank you for reading!    \n        "},

That being said, Great Teacher Onizuka is a hilarious, laughable roller-coaster ride centering around a perverse ex-motor-bike gang-leader gone teacher who teaches life-lessons to his students.  \nGTO maintains an awesome balance between establishing morals such as owning up to your personal mistakes and being more self-confident with humor, which, to me is why it's one of my favorites; one of the shows that I always seem to come back to every other year or so.  \nWhile the show\n          \n        does have a slow start, once it picks up it's quite funny; Onizuka's straight-forward, semi-gullible attitude allowed the writers to write humor in easily as well as offer a distinctive contrast when Onizuka is serious; that is, teaching his life lessons, though, not always in the most round about ways (which is why it's funny).\nThe story falls into \"Arcs\" each with its distinctive person/persona who may or may be having trouble with something with their life.  The story itself is fairly average at first, it's nothing \"ground breaking\", but it's averageness allows for more empathy between the audience and the characters.  The beauty of GTO lies in how realistic the situations are.\nThe art in GTO ranges around a 7-8, (I gave it an eight, first off, because the art fits the story and the persona's of the characters).  The animation (may or may not be) akin to around the 80's animation period, once you watch enough anime you  may come to the conclusion (as I have), that art/animation is only tantamount to the balance it has with the rest of the show.\nSound wise, the music in GTO is fairly decent, nothing terribly memorable; the sheer wackiness of scenes (such as the beach trip where Onizuka fires a harpoon gun) make up for sound/music.  GTO is far more action/drama based than anything else.\nCharacter wise, GTO is average; static characters are brought into perspective through distinctive Arc's that serve to emphasize and tell a greater story or teach a lesson, then sooner than naught the story moves on.\nGTO is 43 episodes long, it's a show to compliment others; I wouldn't recommend watching it as a primary show unless you know what your getting yourself in for; it's an extremely enjoyable show once the Arc-format picks up, but it does feel as though it ended early (Well, it did in-comparison to the Manga I hear) which is why my final rating is a 9/10.\nThe true value in GTO is that it's the story of a fuck-up (excuse my language) who's still able to connect and impart life-knowledge and lessons with a younger generation.  Think of GTO (Onizuka) as that teacher that made a difference in your life.  \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    If you haven't heard of this show you should stop whatever you're doing and give the first episode a sampling. GTO is an amazing classic that combines a likable, self-proclaimed pervert with an amazing character-based story showing the growth of the world's naughtiest group of students. His struggles and the lessons he teaches his students go beyond that one would normally expect from a teacher, and that is what makes this series good. What surprises me most about this show is that despite the male-oriented ecchi aspects, many girls also hold this show in high regard. Animation: It struck me at first how dated the\n          \n        animation looks but one gets used to after awhile. Expect saturated colors and gritty, thick strokes throughout. Detail is only fair in general and effects are rather lacking compared to today's high-production works. The characters are also drawn differently than what I'm used to, especially Onizuka when he does his crazy monkey-like face. This show has plenty of action, fittingly for a seemingly indestructible veteran of a biker gang. Expect a fair amount of fighting from this black belt, along with unrealistic proportions of blood gushing out. The show also has plenty of ecchi, very few shows are willing to start with an upskirt in the very first frame, but this gutsy first frame set the tone for the rest of the show in style.\nStory: The majority of the series follows Onizuka as he gains the trust of his class, which had previously been psychologically wounded by a former teacher. At first, everyone doesn't trust him and does everything in their power to get rid of him. However, his bike-gang experience and pure guts show that he will do anything to win over his students' trust. Be it family problems or relationships, his teachings go well beyond the textbook. The show follows Onizuka through his \"trials\" as students successively attempt plots to either embarrass Onizuka or get him fired. This is a perspective that I have yet to see another show pull off successfully. Expect a very enjoyable amount of tension as well as an equal amount of humorous situations. The show builds to a huge final climax that is resolved in a very fitting manner. Overall, the show gives off a very warm and positive feeling, as if telling us to still have faith in humanity. \nCharacter: There are a lot of characters in GTO with very different personalities, and each one has some story to tell and some conflict to have resolved. Thus expect a lot of character development as Onizuka does his magic. I really liked how they were able to explicate so many characters without the viewer getting lost in it all. The only thing that isn't believable is Onizuka himself and his superman-like ability to survive seemingly any injury, be it jumping off a building or being hit in the head with a bat. What is also particularly well done is the sense of group. There are many cliques within the class and the show masterfully mixes individual development with that of the group. In addition, there are also romantic developments between certain characters as well- this was particularly enjoyable for me. \nValue: Despite being quite long, I've re-watched this show multiple times and it's still great.

He may be a pervert, but he has a big heart and it shows in every episode as he shows his students how to enjoy school again (even though they are all trying to bring him down). We get to know a lot about the students in his class over the course of the anime. As each of their problems are solved, there is a visible change in their attitude. There are just enough episodes for us to get to know and care about\n          \n        all of them. The only thing that felt out of place was the ending, but I'll get back to that later.\nThe music which is played matches the scene greatly and definitely helps a lot. Onizukas' theme is one of my favorite anime songs. Every time I hear it, I can't help but smile.\nThe animation is pretty good, considering it was made in 1999. I especially liked all the funny faces Onizuka makes.\nIt's a shame that it had to end the way it did, but the anime ended before the manga did, so I can forgive them. There is no better thing to do than watch it again since you will be wanting more. Great Teacher Onizuka deserves its spot as one of my top 5 anime.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="                          \n    Let me start off by saying I'm a huge fan of GTO's manga, the source of all its zany, raunchy material. It's easily my favorite manga of all time, and because it is such, I have high expectations for the anime. Perhaps my expectations were unreasonably high, but regardless, I wasn't nearly as happy with the anime as I was with the manga. \nStory: 5\nThe anime did a somewhat good job at adapting some of the earlier chapters of GTO. They were definitely outstanding in the episode where Onizuka dresses up as Doraemon (and that's as far as I'll go for spoilers). However, it all\n          \n        starts to go downhill during the middle of the series. A lot of this has to do with the manga running longer than the anime, but they could've either ended it with a \"to be continued\" instead of finding an improvised way to wrap up the anime. \nArt: 6\nThe artwork feels too flat to me, and that's saying a lot coming from someone that's read the manga. The times where Onizuka's face contorts according to his emotions are pretty spot on, but the rest of the artwork doesn't inspire as much awe and even looks washed out in some frames. \nOn another note, the openings and endings of Onizuka deserve a high score on their own. Very stylish and aesthetically appealing, they totally gave the right kind of feel to what the Onizuka anime should've been. \nSound: 2 in English, 8 in Japanese\nThe English dub is atrocious. Even the great Steven Blum feels miscast as Onizuka. This series was definitely meant to be heard in Japanese. Onizuka's seiyuu is easily another class of its own, as he brought life to the character better than anyone else. You can also tell he's enjoying it as he goes. \nThe OST of the series, however, is another thing holding this score back. A lot of it feels very generic and hammy. The melodramatic moments in the series look even more hokey with the OST playing in the background. (all of this excludes the sublime opening and ending theme songs, by the way)\nEnjoyment: 6\nIt had its moments, but coming from the manga, it was a little harder for me to enjoy. So many things were missing, and the mood the anime was trying to convey didn't quite match what the manga achieved. Viewers that didn't read the manga beforehand will enjoy this series more than I did.\nOverall: 6\nNot much to say that hasn't already been said. Onizuka's opening videos and music were some of the most creative and inspiring works of art I've seen. The rest of the animation left more to be desired. GTO will still entertain casual anime fans, but if you're a manga reader like me, you'll cross your fingers and pray they do a reboot to GTO to give it justice, much like they did to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. \n        "},

You may not understand it form the first episodes but when you watch the final episode everything will become clear. GTO has everything - comedy, action, romance, drama, and some pervert characters. I enjoyed every single minute of it and its now one of my favourite animes. At first it looks like a shounen comedy, but after 10-15 episodes it shows some important social problems. There are a lot of things that wont be clear to you until you see the last episode but you will definitely enjoy it. Its really\n          \n        strange that a funny and perverted character like Onizuka can be so serious and can even teach something the older people. You will be able to see the matureing of the character throughout the episodes. Its amazing that a teacher like Onizuka can win the respect of his students, who all hate him because ... You will see why (I dont want to spoil). \nAll in all GTO is an amazing anime full with excitement, fun and entertaiment. If you're a true anime fan you must definitely watch it!!!

Increasing numbers of students care less for their future and education, resorting to violence, gangs, drugs, and sex. Things that degrade society. \nWhat is the purpose of an education then? \nTo excel in the academics, attend a prestigious university, and find a well-paying job.  \nBut what happens to other students who are not capable of achieving the expectations that society has placed on them? \nSimple. They are left behind. They become subjected to delinquency and are frowned upon by the upper class of the\n          \n        well-educated society. \nAre the students to be blamed? Or, perhaps, are the teachers the ones to blame?\n“The relationship between a student and a teacher is a sacred one.” \nTaking place at the reputable Holy Forest Academy, the Great Teacher Onizuka, a 22 year old virgin and former mischievous bike gangster, arrived to save the school from these problems! \nGTO attacks the education system in Japan. Onizuka, with a flawed and shady record, makes him the most unqualified teacher. But the bureaucrats were not seeing past the true Onizuka. The story shows Onizuka avoiding being expelled by his students, and eventually solving his students’ problems, which cover life lessons and society problems in a subtle but deep way. Each and every character's problems are issues that you can relate to as a student and in real life as well. There are occasional clever surprises and cliff hangers to keep the viewer engaged in the show.\nGTO also features comedy, often sexual and perverted. Ranging from skirt chasing to sexual fantasies, the perverted comedy will occasionally give you a laugh. The stupid, ugly faces that Onizuka usually makes will, initially, disgust you, but you will eventually find it quite humorous.  As common in anime, especially during GTO’s time, some of the intended comedy is not at all funny and turns out to be cheesy and barfing, “smh” comedy. But there were times when I caught myself laughing out loud at the things Onizuka did with his students. \nOccasionally, you will cringe at Onizuka’s unorthodox teaching and discipline methods such as the torture of his disobedient students. The sexual themes are also part of the complaint. Those sensitive to these kinds of materials may not be able to see past it and automatically declare GTO trash and fanservice. This was the best way to describe Onizuka though. He does not hide any faults. He explicitly reveals them. He boldly walks with the words “pervert”, “pedo”, “gangster” on the back his shirt not worrying about how others judge him. In spite of his imperfection, Onizuka perfectly exemplifies the true man and teacher. Onizuka is basically Hester Prynne from Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter but in a far more humorous and contemporary way.\nThe OST was relatively good, with some really memorable soundtracks. The OPs and EDs were nice to watch and listen to as well. I was not fond of the sub, most particularly because of Onizuka's voice actor. Try out the dub for the legendary Cowboy Bebop Spike's voice actor, Steven Blum, who does Oniuzka's dub. \nThe art/animation was pretty decent for its time. \nGTO suffers from technical problems such as occasional bad writing. Some arcs ended abruptly or had a random filler episode in a few arcs. Some dialogues were poorly written, making intended emotional scenes sound pathetically dumb and extremely cheesy. \nOverall, you will find GTO enjoyable and fun to watch. With the frequent comedy, deep and emotional scenes will give a change in pace and catch you by surprise. It was a show that revealed the problems in a diploma-based society and the issues of the current education system. It’s silly. It’s stupid. It’s deep. It’s fresh. \nSo remember, if you think you can expel tor outsmart teachers, then you haven’t seen Great Teacher Onizuka!\n        "},

		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    This show was enjoyable, but weird. Not weird in the sense of story, characters, premise, but weird because of it's production. There's definitely a lot to talk about.\nGreat Teacher Onizuka is one of the highest rated shows here on MAL, and has been for, well, as long as I've been on the site if I remember correctly. So naturally I, and some of my closer friends were interested in GTO for quite a while now, but that interest remained only that, an interest. It wasn't localised where we live and didn't become popular even when the internet became more widely used. And thus we didn't\n          \n        actually bother watching it, only sometimes talk about it. \nUntil now. \nFor some reason I was compelled to watch this show out of the blue since I was getting nowhere with the original Gundam (which I was supposed to be finished with by the end of 2016) and I was craving a late '90s show. \nSTORY: Some minor spoilers ahead in this section. \nThe story follows the ex-gang menber, delinquent, virgin, highschool dropout, fresh college graduate Eikichi Onizuka, 22 years old. He wants to become a teacher to look up high-school girls skirts. Once he actually gets hired, he gets hired by pure luck, by a eccentric principal of a private Junior High School. So no skirt hunting for him. The class he gets is a class of teacher-hating kids, who actively try to drive away any homeroom teacher that they end up getting. The story is basically about how he makes his students warm up to him and how -in his own words- he's \"trying to make school fun\". \nThe series is divided into character arcs, where we get to know Onizuka, a few teachers and not much more students. The students and one teacher constantly try to get Onizuka fired, the principal and another teacher are always on his side, the students eventually warm up to him after some of his \"tough love\" and that's basically it. It sounds very basic and bare, and it is to a degree, but the focus is largely on the characters in this show. \nThe last arc and the conclusion is an anime-only ending(since the manga wasn't finished in 2000 yet) and thus is a bit half-cooked. It's decent, but the ending of the last episode is just silly and is very clear that it was only done this way for convenience.\nCHARACTERS:\nThere is a couple, and most of them are pretty tightly done. Not complicated or convoluted but simple, easy to understand (kind of), relatable, but still relevant tropes.\nOnizuka is a mix of a Shounen and a Seinen protagonist. He's older than the average Shounen hero, but acts the part. He is someone that just started a full-time, honest job, but still has the brain of a teenager. He's openly perverted, very physical and a man of whim. He isn't a good role model, even though his job is teaching young teens. He, though acts (and is) more like a father figure to his students. He wants them to have fun in school, while they're still in middle school and vows never to talk down to or insult them, lest they end up like him when he was a teen. He grows with them. He sometimes dances on the edge of becoming a \"Gary Stu\" though, which sometimes bothered me, but his antics always managed to drag him back. Oh yeah, about that. He's stupid. His stupidity and naiveté often brings him and his students trouble, and sometimes halts the flow of 'plot progression', which he has to then remedy (or has to rely on somebody else to remedy it for him). This is a point in many of the arcs this series is made of. \nIn the book \"Manga: The Complete Guide\", the author Jason Thompson says this about him: \"The rule of the manga is that every time Onizuka does something incredibly cool and heartwarming, he must immediately do something unbelievably retarded\". Which is entirely true in the anime as well. \nIf Onizuka is the bread of the story, then the other main cast is the butter. This being almost an entirely character-focused show, it's really, really hard not to talk about specific characters in-depth. \nThe writing is not complicated, as I said before. The kids usually have to deal with a major issue in their life, and Onizuka, being the \"Teacher of Life\", helps them (directly or indirectly) and in turn they help him. Most of them have development, some of them don't. Some of them go through major life-changes, some of them make it a point to change only on the surface or not at all. Most of them feel incomplete too, since the manga wasn't out completely. Many ends were left loose. Some characters get a lot of screentime, while others get barely any. Even still, it's the characters that keep the series moving. \nI have more to say on this matter, but it will be under the \"Production\" section.\nART: \nIt's a mixed bag. It has a style reminiscent of the '90s, but the low framerate and \"choppy\" movement reminds me of the 2000s. The backgrounds are nice, and the facial expressions are detailed, but it still feels cheap. It's that kind of \"eh, it's fine\" kind of cheap. Can't say I'm the biggest fan. \nMUSIC:\nThe openings are great. They emphasise what Onizuka is all about, especially the first one: \"Driver's High\". The endigs are good too. They're more somber and slow, but fit the show well. The last one is, I think too slow for the kind of things, that part of the series focuses on. They fit the last two episodes, but not before I think. I've largely forgotten the rest of the OST, except one track.\nPRODUCTION:\nThis is the origin of most of the problems. The GTO manga won the 1998 Kodansha Manga Award in the \"Shounen\" category. What this meant is that companies scurried to license the comics to make money fast. In 1998, a live-action series was already produced and the anime wasn't far away. Who got the licence? Studio Pierrot. The integrity of the source they adapt is usually not of primary importance to them. Their goal is to cash in on someting big as soon as it gets some recognition and churning out an adaptation as fast and as cheaply as possible. They're very transparent in this department. They can make good stuff, but most of their work feels rushed and/or overconfident. They don't have to fear any significant loss either, because the things they adapt are usually \"hip\" and \"cool with the kids\" kind of manga series or long-running shounen. Naruto, Bleach, Tokyo Ghoul, Beelzebub. I'm sure you've heard of them. They use a lot of fillers if the manga is not caught up or is on hiatus. Usually they have no problem just inserting unrelated happenings between two related episodes. Sometimes they just finish the story with their own endings, sometimes contrasting with the story up to that point. They also don't care for the quality of filler-arcs or in-manga filler chapters. They just animate them with half the effort and, to get back to the review, in GTO for example: One episode is about this P.E. Teacher dude, and he's very detailed and all that. Next episode he has a one-liner and he suddenly looks like he had his skin run over with skin-color paint and his features polished to a few ovals. This is exceptionally jarring considering this is a 43 episode show and charaters like this regularly return. \nGTO has this weird duality as result of this. I call it \"fake and real episodes\". While this isn't a very accurate description, I feel it captures the feeling well. The episodes that detail the main story are much more cleanly animated and is clear that more effort went into them than the other half. The not-important, mainly comedic episodes look like they were animated as time-efficiently as possible. Only the character which is talking in the scene is even remotely detailed and some of the backdrop people look like carton billboard-men. \nMy favorite was how they handled product placement. In one of the first episodes, Onizuka is playing Ape Escape on the PS1. No, really. Actual footage of the game is in the show. The PS1 looks like a PS1 and the SONY logo is always visible. A couple of episodes later, one of the characters takes out some electronic device (I don't remember, but I think it was the same game console), and the logo reads SOMY this time. Was the advertisement only allowed for a week or what happened here? Best thing is that the real Sony stuff comes back later too. \nThe greater half of the problem here is the way the adaptation.. is. It was adapted because of the Kodansha Award and not because it was an actual good manga. The ratings would've been lower if they waited until it was completed. It definitely has a potential to become an actual great anime (FMA: Brotherhood, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, just to name a few similar cases), but for now this half-done adaptation is all we have. \nAnd the weird part is:\nENJOYMENT:\nIt's not bad. The source material keeps it afloat no problem, despite it being adpted by cynical old businessmen. I definitely want to read the manga now, so I guess that goal was reached. The characters are charming, and well done and the story isn't as scatterbrained as it could have been. \nI definitely think this should be readapted, because the lessons Onizuka teaches are valuable to the target audience of teens and young adults alike. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    This is actually my first ever review lol.\nWell what can I say? This series was just pure awesome. I admit the only reason I watched it was because it had mediafire links. But boy, am I glad i did. 43 excellent, laugh-out loud episodes.\n\nThe story itself sounds at first pretty standard. Its basically about a group of students who try to get rid of a teacher who is trying to teach them about life, like I said, pretty cliche. However, that's where the cliche ends. The teacher, Eikichi Onizuka, is a 22 year old virgin, who became a teacher with the sole purpose of getting\n          \n        laid either with a high school girl or a fellow teacher. He might sound like a creep but after the first episode it is impossible not to find him awesome. I watched all 43 episodes and I think I laughed about a thousand times.\nThe series' main theme is undoubtedly comedy but there are also some real emotional moments. Some episodes are really serious. They discuss the controversial subjects of bullying, blackmail, corruption and abuse of authority so while it is a heart warming comedy and relatively old it really details some of the major problems in society.\nThe animation is decent for an anime that is fairly old and I was impressed by how much the supporting characters were developed. My only complaint was that the last two episodes were a bit rushed and didn't follow the manga as well as the others. Overall, however this is an awesome anime and a definite must-see."},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Enough said. \nJust kidding. \nStory: 7/10\nGTO is probably the most popular classic comedy in animation ever. This anime inspired so many other plots for Christ sake! And the definition for “anime” or “Japanese cartoon” should include GTO in the description. This anime made me laugh. The humour in the story was not only memorable but gave the story the proper structure. Although, the plot itself wasn’t very organized. It gave the audience some entertainment sure, but it was choppy. The pace went up and down like a roller coaster. Side stories and fillers made it less interesting. It had so much potential but fell\n          \n        short. However, I am going to admit, the plot, as slow as it might’ve been, did give an excellent ending. I’ll reassure you all; it ends on a solid note. \nArt: 9/10\nNo doubt about it, this is what anime should look like. I love, love, LOVE the animation in this, especially the facial features. I couldn’t stop laughing whenever Onizuka showed a funny expression or other character for that matter. It’s really what made the anime unique! The background art even impressed me! The style of the 90’s really showed clearly. And the style is definitely the old fashioned style that is rarely used anymore. \nSound: 9/10\nAs a dubbed watcher I have to say, this was very well done. The voice actors did well to keep the character’s voice in check. It matched well with who they were and brought on the comedy in the tone and mood of the voice.  The funny noises the characters made, the emotion set through, it was all great!\nThe opening songs were both equally great! It set the tone of this guy will do anything for women he loves, even though he’s incredibly silly when he looks cool. It’s a dream he’s in and boom! At the end he’s found in his room, smoking a cig. It’s a fairy tale dream and really does well to keep up with what the anime might be about. \nCharacter: 8/10\nNo doubt, Onizuka is the funniest character I’ve come across. He’s also seems like a pretty rad teacher too! I wouldn’t mind him as my professor. Lol On top of that, he’s a past gang leader, has mad ninja skills, and seems to be almost invincible. Puts a bit of a twist on the whole thing. But what I like most about him is he seems like he has a fear of woman even though he’s wildly obsessed with them. \nThe only character I question is Urumi Kanazaki. She seems too smart. I mean there is smart, and then there is too smart. She’s the latter. It’s interesting that she has heterochromia iridium which I’ve never seen on an anime character before, and I’m curious to know if that is tied into something more.

I made a decision that day to never blame anyone ever again for my own mistakes, and to try to avoid blaming others in general, but instead finding a solution.\nGreat Teacher Onizuka became my favorite anime of all time, I saw this anime in 2013, watching this anime was a lot of fun, it is very funny and interesting, yet the lessons Eikichi throws are like truth bullets and solid facts that will manage to hit you one by one, I feel like I have learned from this a lot of quality life lessons, it certainly taught me more life lessons than any of my school teachers.\n this anime will move you, it will take you on an emotional roller coaster, you will experience happiness, joy, warmth and love, you will also smile, laugh and even cry, prepare to be human again, prepare to reunite with emotions you thought it was long gone.\nEikichi Onizuka is not a fictional character...he is indeed a great teacher, he is the teacher that should teach teachers how to teach. If every teacher was like Onizuka, students will learn far more beyond their books.\n        "},

The GTO anime IS good; very funny and somewhat heartwarming, but after being introduced by the manga, I actually was a little disappointed here. I'll definately go back to read the manga from start to finish, because I feel something is missing in the anime. Mainly sufficient character development.\nAnimation	\nNot too bad, the opening #1 is especially impressively animated. The graphical quality of the actual episodes varies quite much, though. It's almost like they hired different animators for some episodes. The lips/voice synq wasn't that great\n          \n        either. \nCharacter design and facial expressions were great, though. Onizuka's face in hilarious!\nI'm no hardcore ecchi fan, but I think there could have been a lot more of that in this anime. Since Onizuka is such a perverted guy, I think it would fit the theme well with more boobs and panty shots. =)\nSound	\nThe opening and ending themes are ok. I especially liked the ending theme #2. Too bad it didn't last for more than a few episodes. Opening teme #1 is good, but I have a problem liking male japanese singers. Can't explain why.\nI had no problems with the voice acting. Onizuka sounds a bit too old from time to time, but that wasn't that much of a problem. It fits him somehow. All the other voice actors were good too, as far as I'm concerned.\nStory	\nBasically, most episodes are about Onizuka converting a student that previously was hostile towards him. Still, there are much variation betwen the episodes, and many great laughs to be had. Despite a few meaningless filler episodes, most drives the story forward.\nI didn't get the ending at all though. Is that what you call an ending (happy or not)? I think this anime deserved one.\nThe abrupt ending also leaves lots of loose ends. The manga was more slow-paced, so I hope more will be explained there.\nCharacter	\nYay, lots and lots of interesting characters! Since this is a rather long anime, most of them get at least decently presented. I think it could have been even better, though. In 43 episodes, there could have been much more character development. There actually are quite a lot already, but I wasn't entirelly satisfied. \nAll in all, I loved most of the characters. The main reason I didn't give GTO a 10 here, is in fact Onizuka himself. He gets too much screen time, and always interferes when other characters are starting to develop. He flies in like a superhero in the end of every episode, and the other characters never get to solve their problems on their own. I still like him, it's just that he gets in the way of everyone else.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    GTO is about Eikichi Onizuka, a Japanese delinquent (although one could make the inference that due to the several Union Jacks he keeps around, that he is possibly British), virgin and pervert, who is 22 years old and will announce this in his trademark \"Onizuka Eikichi, 22 sai, Yorishku!\" (Eikichi Onizuka, 22 years old, nice to meet you!). He decides to stop being a gang member and become a teacher, initially because he wants to seduce high school girls, but later comes to help his students. As Onizuka has never held a formal job for more than a few weeks, he botches the interview, but\n          \n        is accepted because the school thinks he'll be able to properly manage Class O. Class O consists of rejects, juvenile delinquents, and all sorts of unsavoury characters, who had driven a previous teacher to suicide. Onizuka does indeed manage to take control of them, and this is where the story begins.\nAs his name is in the title, Onizuka is the star of GTO, and he is worthy of being a main character. Onizuka is an idiot, and in one episode, this is exemplified by him being unable to get a passing grade on a primary school level exam. However, through persuasion (and intimidation at times), he is always able to pull himself through. There are other recurring characters, such as the Vice Principal whose Cresta (an expensive car) manages to get destroyed in one way or another almost every episode by Onizuka, or Fuyutsuki, a 'normal' teacher who contrasts greatly to the wild Onizuka, and despite Onizuka's best efforts, they do not form a romantic relationship.\nFor the majority of GTO, the focus is on Onizuka's students. He helps a variety of people with a variety of problems. The story initially has a slightly darker tone, with Onizuka having to save a singular student from multiple suicide attempts, but it does eventually lighten up, with car chases that pay clear homage to Initial D, and the mandatory beach episode (albeit it's actually enjoyable in GTO's case, whereas in the majority of anime it's just an excuse to have gaudy shots of all the main heroines in swimsuits).\nGTO is quite an old anime, released between 1999 and 2000, and it very clearly shows itself, however, I do not consider this a negative. It gives a distinctive style, and I think it's a shame that the majority of anime today, while it may look a little nicer, is far less animated and exaggerated than older ones like GTO, and while there are some exceptions to this, overall I think this older style of anime is a lot more 'alive'.\nGTO is a very enjoyable anime, quite simply. While the premise isn't anything special, Onizuka alone and his absurd ways of reacting to the situations he's confronted with makes it worth it. One could analyse deeper into each of the episodes and find a profound message about how one's problems are always solvable and that the seemingly child-like period of adolescence isn't that different to adulthood, or something along those lines, but I don't think that's necessary. GTO is a fun anime, and it's a good laugh with high moments of action, and it stays consistently strong, and is a worthy addition to anyone's collection.\n        "},

So far I've felt there was nothing that I could say that others, by some reason, never did. Perhaps other people might have said what I'm about to say, but I digress. \nI am a College teacher, anime lover, and eternal procrastinator, who had GTO lost somewhere among a fairly big backlog. One day, completely bored out of my mind, I decided to pick something that a friend of mine recommended a long time ago. I read the synopsis, and I thought \"hey, I am a teacher, and the hook sounds pretty fun (albeit generic to today's\n          \n        standards)\". And so my journey of binge-watching began. \n/Review\\nGreat Teacher Onizuka is something that I'd recommend to everyone. I'd do so because its setting is one of the few things that all of us can easily relate to. For at least once in our lives we were students. Some of us still are. Others are (fortunate enough to be/unfortunately) teachers. However, this is not a random school/slice of life ordinary anime, this is probably one of the best examples of how teacher-student relationship should be. \nOk, I'm not saying every teacher should be a rowdy over the top perv, but the reason why I liked this series so much is because of how the main character does everything he can to make classes fun, while taking responsibility not only for his actions, but also for his students'. \nEverything Onizuka and the class 3-4 do contribute to the perfect tone of this story. Most of the times you'll want to laugh so much you'll try hard not to wake your neighbors up, but a few times you'll legitimately want to shed a tear leaving you no option but to hide from your family who won't understand why the hell you are crying. The story is not very elaborate per se, revolving around the people that partake in the daily activities of a private school, but that's actually one of its strong points. It focuses on character development and complex personal relationships between the students, parents, teachers, and the rest of the school staff. \nOf course you have some very stereotypical characters, every anime has them, but GTO manages to enhance their features and make them actually matter, all the while contributing to a great dynamic between everyone involved.\nThe art, animation and even some of the gags are a bit outdated, but personally they didn't turn me off. The rest is so good that it compensates for some of its more obsolete features.\nI'd address the sound, but it's one of those things that I hardly care about. I mean, if it's the seiyuu's contribution to the greatness of this anime, then I must emphasize that they did a great job. However, about the OP/ED, overall sound effects and music... heh... it's not my cup of tea, so I'm barely qualified to judge that.\n/Verdict\\nWell, as far as the theme, tone, character development, and ability to make you emotionally invested in what happens throughout the series, GTO is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the best animes I've seen. \nI don't usually rate many series with \"+8 ratings\", but GTO clearly deserves a 9/10. It doesn't get a 10/10 because the ending feels a bit rushed (it's common knowledge that it's a filler ending).\nIf you're looking for pure enjoyment, look no further than GTO. After all, he's is Eikichi Onizuka, a 22-year-old bachelor, ex-leader of a bike gang, and the best teacher there is!"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    It is difficult to write a review about a series so widely reviewed so many years after its release. As a result, I have taken the liberty to not view certain scenes as \"cliche,\" as that adjective only applies to GTO as a result of the wake it left, and if these things seem cliche, it is likely because the massive success of GTO helped (along with others) to popularize it to the point of becoming cliche. Also, take the \"7\" I gave the artwork lightly. While, yes, the artwork was likely lovely for the time (and it stands up still!) my love of it\n          \n        is clearly from a place of nostalgia. I also am an English major, so my understanding of artistic technique and criticism thereof is not worth much.\nStory: 8\nGTO will likely stick with me forever as just one of the most fucking enjoyable works I've seen in a long while. Just from start to finish you will be grinning throughout this anime, and I cannot stress enough that the situational and slapstick comedy will likely withstand any number of years well into the future. That being said, I chose an 8 because the anime does, in my opinion, suffer from several plot point and pacing issues. While it DOES balance an episodic nature with a background linear storyline, there are certain points where I felt like the story took too much time forcing us to fall in love with characters, only to then mash them into a collective \"Onizuka's students,\" categories for the most part. While I'll elaborate more on this in the \"Character,\" section of this review, I think it is vital to understand that the line between \"Story,\" and \"Character,\" is tough to draw. That is to say, the manner in which the plot progresses is not as important as the characters themselves in the meantime. The storyline is then fairly simple: Onizuka is an idiot we root for, and love him as the students come to love him.\nArt: 7\nI won't spend too much time here, as I have already made my prefatory remark above, but let me nerd out and attempt to describe a feeling I'm sure many of you reading this can relate to, and that's the beautiful moment when a work can both remind you of your childhood without forcing you to realize that the work was better in your memory. By this, I of course mean that there are so many older anime that were influential for both myself as a human and the genre itself that I personally can no longer palate. Yu Yu Hakusho, for example, is a tremendous series, but as I tried to rewatch it this year, I became incredibly bored and found that I had come to expect more from an anime, in terms of pacing and dialogue that such an older series was lacking for me. The wonder of Onizuka is that the artwork assuredly reminds me of all the 90s - early 2000s anime I grew up on, but the strength of its characters and story helps to secure it into a unique situation for me in which I can watch an anime that has all the beautiful old nostalgic art direction that I secretly yearn for when I'm feeling down every few years or so, but the benefit of a script and plot that do not feel dated to me. I gave it a \"7\" specifically because it does, indeed, seem \"good,\" to me, as the review prompt ascribes to the choice of \"7,\" and that is as fair a rating as I feel comfortable giving.\nSound: 9.\nAgain, I cannot claim too much mastery in the sound department, as I am not trained to speak of the category from a technical standpoint, so I will just say that the music was nice and fitting, while still giving me that dreamy nostalgic feel that the artwork did. Hearing L'arc in the OP was truly a blast-from-the-past delight for me, for example. That being said though, I gave this category such a high rating because the voice acting in this show is absolutely superb. I am not well-versed enough in voice actors to know if any of the talent were well-renowned for their various abilities, but I can say with absolute certainty that the comedic moments were executed flawlessly due to the mastery of the voice actors in my opinion, and delivery is of course everything in comedy. I was often laughing just as hard from the pitch or intonations of the lines as I was from the joke or situation themselves, and I think that speaks very highly of the work the voice actors accomplished here.\nCharacter: 10.\nFinally, the category I feel most assured of writing about. As mentioned previously, I think that the legacy of this show is entirely dependent on its characters, as the plotline itself is rather straight-forward (Problem arises, student hates Onizuka, Onizuka solves problem, student loves Onizuka). Interestingly, I had a bit of a mental struggle with putting my thoughts into words for this category because Onizuka himself is a bit of an enigma for me. You see, I am a practitioner of \"dynamic, dynamic!, DYNAMIC!\" when it comes to characters, but Onizuka some how succeeds for me despite changing very little as a character (or, perhaps, just less so since every student undergoes such a drastic change throughout the series).  Often, I wind up hating characters like Onizuka, referring to them snobbishly as having a \"Superman problem,\" and by that I mean a character who is chosen by the plot to be the hero, and struggles only mildly against problems due to their overwhelming positive traits as characters. This is interestingly NOT the case with Onizuka, as he is often the punchline or whipping-boy of the plot, and does not come ahead as a character until it is crunch time. While this last-second hero trope is also played-out to high heaven with most art, it somehow works for Onizuka, because his actions are often simple while still retaining the idea of being clever. Almost all other characters in the show are uniquely interesting, or even if they aren't, they are strong enough to not necessarily need something dynamic to make them strong (The Chairman, for example). One of the more interesting characters to me though was Uchiyamada, as he is clearly written to be the annoying \"bad\" guy, but his character growth is astronomical and maturely written. Slight spoiler, but in the beginning, the audience is lead to loath him as he calls students trash, but by the end of the show, he has learned once-again the love and power of educating that he lost somewhere along the way. Interestingly, while Onizuka has some small hand is creating the situations that lead to this, Uchiyamada actually gets there independently for the most part, and there is a wonderful moment in which a former student tells a beautiful story about a sunflower that created a legitimately heartfelt moment in which I was happy with the Vice-Principle. By the end of the show, I felt as though Uchiyamada acknowledged Onizuka's strengths WITHOUT liking him, and I think that is a character trait that makes me feel as though he was well-thought out and handled in a mature manner.\nEnjoyment: 10.\nWhat can I say that has not already been said throughout this increasingly lengthy love-letter? Every moment of this show was fun, nostalgic, entertaining and beautiful, and I can proudly say that I was so caught up in the show that I began to watch the live-action adaptation (2012) of it. Although I have about 300 anime under my belt, I had, prior, resisted all temptation of watching a live-action, and GTO was the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back for me. I was laughing to the point of tears often, I was legitimately moved by some of the scenes (Often with Tomoko, as I loved her side plots) and this will likely stick with me as a quintessentially \"good,\" anime all my life.\nOverall: 10.\nRead above. I'm done fanboying about this show, and about ready to crawl into that dark place we all go when something beautiful comes to an end, and we're forced to confront the idea of retiring from the great game of anime-watching at the top, or venturing forth towards other beautiful tomorrows (spoiler alert: we never really give up, do we?)\nRecommendations: \n1. Golden Boy. These both fill the same hole in my heart in a perfect nostalgic/hilarious combination. While they are otherwise the antithesis of eachother (Kintarou is a genius college kid and Onizuka is a dopey dropout) they remarkably are still essentially the same character: Unexpectedly clever individuals full of humor with hearts of gold. I think the shortness of Golden Boy makes it a great cooldown watch after a GTO binge.\n2. Yu Yu Hakusho. I know, I know, I shit on this series earlier, but hear me out! One of the joys, to me at least, of GTO is the cultural significance, and by that I mean the fact that it was airing nearly 19 years ago from the date of writing this review. While I think it is dangerous to assume to understanding Japanese culture strictly from watching anime, I also often argue that you can definitely get a feel for real-life historical issues, especially in slice-of-life, of course. Yu Yu Hakusho does a similar job, complete with silly \"Yankee\" pompadour hairdos, and 90's aesthetics for hair, cars, and color-pallets. \n3. Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records (Akashic Records of Bastard Magic Instructor): In hindsight, I have to wonder how much of the writing process for Akashic was spent rewatching GTO or subconsciously reflecting back on it. While I would never suggest that their storylines are similar (they both are strong independently, and I am almost always hard-pressed to suggest that show is bad for sharing similarities with other shows) I think that Glenn was meant to be presented as an Onizuka type. Glenn has a much darker background, and I personally think Akashic delves into emotion in a more satisfying manner that modern anime seem to execute more successfully, and Akashic has a significantly different genre even than GTO. Still, the similarities between Glenn and Onizuka as \"lazy, foul-mouthed heathens with power when it counts\" makes them fun similar watches.\n        "},

The episodes had absolutely no connection to eachother except for the occasional episode referring to the previous one. The lessons learned in each episode made me almost think of Pokemon. The occasional ecchi was the only thing that spiced up the anime IMHO, so that significantly lowers the score in any case.\nI skipped about 10 episodes in the middle due to the fact of the constant roll-back each and every episode.

Well, I guess that’s what this show tries to answer… along with a lot of mayhem and jokes! The storyline follows a guy who parents would probably scream about if they were teaching there child in real life as he tries to become a real teacher. Strangely, the show does not start out with the main class but during the days that Onizuka is able to go and work as a student teacher. This only lasts a few episodes and gives a sense of character for Onizuka, then gives us all the\n          \n        other students.\nThe students on the other hand… they feel like one shot notes actually. We got the computer nerd, the game nerd, the mama’s boy, the clumsy large breasted girl, the bitch, the incredible genius, and so on. Each one has problems with life and Onizuka just knocks one problem out one at a time in a short amount of time mostly.\nA lot of the comedy is pretty much parodies of a lot of different things normal students would see… and then it throws the whole book at them and yells ‘NO! We are going to go off the deep end even more!’ which Onizuka does on a regular bases. It’s a bit funny how much shit he can end up walking away from and not be either dead or thrown out of the school entirely. Onizuka is one lucky son of a bitch; I can say that for sure. If he believes in something, nothing will get in his way of doing it. That’s what really makes him a great teacher, not how he teaches but because he is able to believe in himself and his students. In the ‘end’ that’s how he wins most of his students over to his side after many of them had already felt betrayed by other teachers.\nThe animation actually is pretty crazy, sometimes looking really serious and other times going completely belly up. This is one of those shows that you never know what will happen next in the animation. I’m not really found of when they become really realistic in the faces, giving it an almost gangster look. Sadly though, when they don’t do that it feels like the faces lack in a way. The women’s faces look better but the males feel rather blank without it. I do understand the reasoning behind this though. The show was based off a Live Action drama that was a large hit in Japan so they tried to imitate that into the anime and that makes it kind of loses its luster.\nThe music in the beginning of both seasons is pretty good though the ending lacks mostly. It just lacks the energy that should probably be in it and makes things just seem like I want to skip them all. It was definitely not so for the opening which I mostly didn’t skip for how epic it was! The English dubbing is really off and sometimes feels rather amateurish, although it was a little easier to watch then the Japanese (Partly my own opinion, I’m not much into the subs). But, although rather bad, it’s actually really good that way. I was really surprised that Wendee Lee actually plays an older woman then a little girl!\n        "},

Because of Onizuka Sensei's excessive attachment to underage girls' panties, which, at the time, I found unbearable, or at least unworthy of 43 episodes. \nHowever, I was soon to see there is much more behind this dramatically idiotic attitude. There is pain and strong willpower mixed with over-the-top optimism, teenage saltiness, and a genuine desire to make the world a better place...all of these parading through Onizuka's total lack of social etiquette and education. \nUnfortunately, GTO won me over only to lose me again as a fan.\nFor me, this show should have\n          \n        never gone past episode 19 or to be more precise, never last more than 21 episodes. 19 out of 43 episodes made me laugh sincerely and root for the gangster desperately trying to turn teacher. It appeared he was going to tackle the deepest secrets and fears of each of his class members and make them see life in a different, positive way, using his rugged \"educational approach\". In the process, characters were evolving and unfolding their stories in an honest and fun way. This was a solid 10 anime. The additional two episodes were at least as good, but unfortunately came too late.\nGoing forward with the series, something broke - characters lost their sharpness and the stories looked like Naruto fillers and Fairy Tail episodes at the same time...if that’s even possible. The anime became so weak and hard to bear, I watched it on double speed, just to try and find some worthy moment. Unfortunately, it was a downward spiral. \nI will only give few hints and avoid spoilers - repetitiveness, inconsistency in character behaviour, forced drama, uncalled matchmaking, and a school trip to Okinawa’s beaches preceded by a swimsuit hunt. Worst part is, the last worthy story was \"suffocating\" in episode 42 and 43 right after all the mess, rendering this last effort more or less useless. \nAt the end, I am not sorry for watching.

This goes for the supporting characters also.\nEnjoyment\n9/10\nI watched GTO the entire day and went to sleep at 6am, need i say more about how enjoyable it was? \nOverall\n9.5/10\nUsually i don't like comedy/slice-of-life/drama type of animes, they usually disappoint, but GTO was a masterpiece. Everything comes together SO well. The writer did an AMAZING job, everything just comes together in this show and it totally impresses and entertains\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Ah, GTO. Who could forget this classic anime? Not me, that's for sure. I started watching this anime on my Comcast On Demand, and instantly became hooked. It's a pretty nice slice of life anime, with laughs all around, and a back story that's really original.  There's been animes on teachers before, but not like this. Oh no.\nStory (7/10):\nFor a slice of life anime, GTO does pretty good for its self in the story area. The story basically is Onizuka, once a biker-gang member, becoming a teacher. It's a really interesting job for a biker gang leader when you think about it. And how\n          \n        he  gets to be a teacher is pretty funny. No PhD, no nothing. Just a man looking to became a teacher getting hired by lady who hires him because she trusts her guts. And as you would imagine, things get hectic. All I can really say is the story line is quite original, as well as the characters.\nArt (6/10):\nThis is where GTO gets a little iffy. The quality isn't that great, but then again, it is a tad old (year 2000). The style isn't all that great either, but it's not horrible, yet lies a little bit more on the good side than bad. \nSounds (6/10):\nThe music really doesn't stick out that much. There is a large variety of it though. From songs that sound like they belong in James Bond or some other action movie, to a few easy going, dancing music with guitars that make you get up out of your seat and shake it. I do tend to listen closely to the music in every anime I watch, and the music here just didn't stick out too much, and wasn't all that great. I never had the chance to watch the original Japanese version, but the English dub voices are good and fir the characters well. So all goes well there.\nCharacter (8/10):\nThe characters are very unique here. Some you've seen before, others you haven't. I mean, a high school actress that's slightly stupid? Very unique there. High school girl snob who does nothing but cause trouble? Seen that one before. But each character truly does have their own personality. It's quite interesting to see some of the students personalities change when Onizuka comes to their school and becomes their teacher. The ones who were usually the class bullies become aids to Onizuka, and help him out through his touch times and troubles. It just points out how much an influence Onizuka was on these kids, and how much a teacher can change his or her students with a little effort (in Onizukas case, a little effort, and a lot of fear)\nEnjoyment (10/10): This really is enjoying to watch. One enjoyment as mentioned above is the sight of seeing the once rough and pain in the neck students change to students who actually slightly listen in class and pay attention (although Onizuka really never teaches his students anything). All the things him and his crazy class do together is just fun to watch. Whether it's going on trips in Okinawa, or just building rocket ships and shooting them at people, you can't help but laugh (I couldn't). Onizuka does so many stupid things that would get a normal teacher fired, but not him. Not the Great Teacher Onizuka.\nOverall (9/10): Close to perfect, but no cigar. Why doesn't this anime get the final 10? Small things really do matter. If the music stuck out more, the quality was a little bit better, as well as the style, then this might have gotten the 10. But don't let that one point fool you. This anime is very fun to watch, and definitly gets you laughing.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    Great Teacher Onizuka focuses on former delinquent and motorcycle gang member Eikichi Onizuka's goal to become a teacher which leads him to the private school known as Holy Forest Academy where he must straighten out the troublemaking students of junior high Class 3-4. Mixing around comedy and drama, GTO explores Onizuka handling the troubles of his students in some bizarre and crazy ways.\nObviously, much of the comedic highlight of the series comes from the antics of Onizuka. He's far from being your ideal candidate for a teacher thanks to his impulsive, perverted, eccentric and violent personality that he relishes in when resolving the varying situations\n          \n        that take place with his students and saving his job against those attempting to sabotage it. While he can be prone to bizarre acts like dressing up in random costumes and ogling any attractive woman that crosses his path, he also isn't afraid to pull crazy acts to get students out of trouble or show “tough love” to those causing trouble. The ridiculous acts that Onizuka pulls throughout the series combined with the comical faces he can display in various situations easily makes him one of the more amusing characters you can see in an anime series.\nOnizuka's fun character is obviously not the only piece of the series that makes GTO a classic. The students and faculty to the series also get their moments to shine as Onizuka finds himself either bringing them under his wing or thwarting their attempts to get rid of him at Holy Forest Academy with his crazy antics. The majority of these characters do get a good deal of fleshing out that explore how they acquired their mentality with either education as a whole from the eyes of a teacher or opposing the educational system as a student. The series has a smidge of social commentary in it where it lashes out against Japan's educational system for ignoring the dreams and desires of its students while obsessing over public image, social status and economic gain. Through Onizuka's crazy ways, the students of Class 3-4 gain someone who allows them to behave as they like without the preaching and obsessing of what the teachers expect them to accept. The only low points with GTO's storytelling are some underdeveloped characters and unresolved storyline developments as the manga digs more into the problems facing some of its characters, like Urumi, Miyabi and Mr. Teshigawara.\nVisually, GTO is about on par with what you expect for a late 1990s anime. The series is obviously running on a limited budget with drab colors, minimal details with scenery and character designs and a number of moments where the visual quality can degrade during more elaborate animation sequences. On the plus side, the anime retains the manga's drawing style thus you still can relish fun out of seeing Onizuka's exaggerated facial expressions in all their glory.\nFor music, the opening and ending musical choices are among the more memorable musical pieces you can listen to out of anime that are fitting for GTO's comical and serious moods, Driver's High and Shizuka being the more memorable ones for this reviewer. Beyond these, the insert tracks do their part to compliment the show's various comical and serious moments yet can gradually get repetitive thanks to GTO's fairly long 43 episode run.\nIn spite of a few hiccups, Great Teacher Onizuka is still among one of anime's more memorable dramedys thanks to the antics of its titular character and having a diverse cast of characters influenced in their actions from a rather messed up educational system. The series is a definite recommendation if you are looking into older anime titles.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Picture this. It is the first day of school and the homeroom teacher is late. Everybody is on edge at the start of the new school year especially from the thought of having a new teacher. In walks a drunken fool which casually proclaims himself to be G.T.O. The Great Teacher Onizuka. Your first thoughts just seem to be filled with rage as you cannot believe the audacity of the headmaster to hire this fool as a teacher.\nYour observations wouldn't be to far from wrong as Eikichi Onizuka is a perverted, lazy, and mildly psychotic person. But beneath the face of this piece of trash,\n          \n        is a person who truly deserves the title of teacher.\nStory - 8/10\nGTO has a simple enough plot, as the majority of the anime revolves around his goal of becoming the best teacher ever, (Not to mention finding a cute girlfriend). It is a slice of life which remains true to the core of slice of life series by being a relaxing and heartfelt series to watch, while at the same time blending in drama to add more depth to the series. The great thing about the drama in the series is the fact that it is written in a relatable and believable way. Themes like bullying, suicide, teenage pregnancy, adultery and peer pressure are all present within the anime  The majority of senarios which transpire over the course of the 43 episode series, revolve around either the problems which Eikichi or his students experience and how he tackles these problems in out of the box ways, while always putting his students feelings first.\nArt - 6/10\nThe art in GTO really hasn't aged very well. I believe this mainly to be a direct result of the 43 episode run time. Character designs are average but at least the majority of the characters had different casual attire. Even though the art isn't exactly a selling point, I loved the series regardless. Anime has proven on numerous occations that it doesn't always need the biggest budget in order to become a successful series and personally I didn't have a problem with the artwork of the series.\nSound - 8/10\nI really enjoyed the score found in GTO. The OST contains a wide variety of musical numbers which are composed to fit the various emotions the series wants you to feel, when for example hearing that Onizuka is going to get fired again, like any good series should do. The musical numbers done on the piano and guitar especially stood out for me. Even though I skipped through the ED's every time, I nearly watched ever single OP. It was a joy to listen to the OP as it fit perfectly with the tone and setting of the series. I watched the English dub of the series and even though some recognizable voices were present a lot of the side characters voice actors were really bad at times.\nCharacter - 9/10\nIf there is one thing that GTO has in droves it is character. Even thought a lot of the students were real asses in the series, I loved the fact that the students shitty behavior was rectified as the majority of them had problems that were to big for children to handle. It was really nice to see Onizuka help his students no matter the personal cost, sometimes even at the stake of his reputation and even his career as a teacher. Onizuka embodies what all teachers should aspire to be, as someone who constantly goes above and beyond to help his students. The comedy works great, because of the variation in characters personalities - be that the students or the other members of the faculty - as the characters are written in such a way to bring out both the best and worst of our main character.\nEnjoyment - 10/10\nYou are most possibly more cynical than myself if you can't find this series the smallest bit enjoyable. Even if the comedy isn't for you, you can always appreciate the mature undertones of the series as it tackles problems which many people have faced in there lives. I thoroughly enjoyed the anime because of the perfect blend comedy, slice of life and drama, which made for a unique experience which few shows can pull off.\nOverall - 9/10\nGTO makes for a relaxing, funny and surprisingly mature series which the majority of people can enjoy. I would highly recommend the series to anyone in need of some positivity in their life. It was a absolute joy to watch the series and would most certainly do so in the future!\nThanks for taking the time to read my review!\n        "},

There has been quite a few like that for me, but almost more than any other, Great Teacher Onizuka was that show that I wish never ended.\nUnfortunately though, all great things must come to an end. And GTO was most certainly great; it's even in the title.\nThis show has such a nice blend of crude, over-the-top comedy that makes me LOL every episode, with emotional drama and heartwarming character relationships and romance that just work.\nAll of the *main* students\n          \n        had their own traits and personalities and felt human, and they all developed drastically, which a lot of anime, especially slice of life ones, always seem to have trouble doing. I ended up liking them all, especially Urumi, Murai, Yoshikawa, Tomoko, and Kikuchi (the majority of them haha!), and I also loved Fuyutsuki-sensei, and, hell, even the Vice Principal became likable, his development was one of the best in the series! (His poor Cresta though! xD)\nAnd the bond that Onizuka shares with his students is absolutely wonderful, he truly impacted their lives and was a strong influence on all of them, in such a good way (well... mostly xD). And what an amazing character Onizuka is. All of the characters in this show rock. Well, Onizuka rocks the most!! He's in my Top 10 characters of all time. He's pervy. He's gross. He's idiotic. He's over the top. He's freaking crazy! Yet, he's got wisdom, and he is a badass. He's a true friend, and probably the most likable character I have seen in an anime, I'd go THAT far. One of the coolest, as well as funniest, anime characters in history.\nOnizuka is truly the greatest teacher of all time, and I wholeheartedly recommend this anime to everyone who wants a funny, meaningful, and overall an enjoyable anime!\nHave a nice day/night depending on where you live, everyone!! :)\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    If you haven't heard of this show you should stop whatever you're doing and give the first episode a sampling. GTO is an amazing classic that combines a likable, self-proclaimed pervert with an amazing character-based story showing the growth of the world's naughtiest group of students. His struggles and the lessons he teaches his students go beyond that one would normally expect from a teacher, and that is what makes this series good. What surprises me most about this show is that despite the male-oriented ecchi aspects, many girls also hold this show in high regard.\nAnimation:\nIt struck me at first how dated the animation looks\n          \n        but one gets used to after awhile. Expect saturated colors and gritty, thick strokes throughout. Detail is only fair in general and effects are rather lacking compared to today's high-production works. The characters are also drawn differently than what I'm used to, especially Onizuka when he does his crazy monkey-like face.\nThis show has plenty of action, fittingly for a seemingly indestructible veteran of a biker gang. Expect a fair amount of fighting from this black belt, along with unrealistic proportions of blood gushing out. The show also has plenty of ecchi, very few shows are willing to start with an upskirt in the very first frame, but this gutsy first frame set the tone for the rest of the show in style.\nSound:\nThe OP/EDs were fair but didn't catch my attention. The BGM was fair most of the time but definitely grows on you through this fairly long work. As for voice acting, there are some notables in the cast including veteran Kotono Mitsuishi and Ayako Kawasumi (Saber anyone?). All the cast did a very good job (especially the vice principal).\nStory:\nThe majority of the series follows Onizuka as he gains the trust of his class, which had previously been psychologically wounded by a former teacher. At first, everyone doesn't trust him and does everything in their power to get rid of him. However, his bike-gang experience and pure guts show that he will do anything to win over his students' trust. Be it family problems or relationships, his teachings go well beyond the textbook.\nThe show follows Onizuka through his \"trials\" as students successively attempt plots to either embarrass Onizuka or get him fired. This is a perspective that I have yet to see another show pull off successfully. Expect a very enjoyable amount of tension as well as an equal amount of humorous situations. The show builds to a huge final climax that is resolved in a very fitting manner. Overall, the show gives off a very warm and positive feeling, as if telling us to still have faith in humanity.\nCharacter:\nThere are a lot of characters in GTO with very different personalities, and each one has some story to tell and some conflict to have resolved. Thus expect a lot of character development as Onizuka does his magic. I really liked how they were able to explicate so many characters without the viewer getting lost in it all. The only thing that isn't believable is Onizuka himself and his superman-like ability to survive seemingly any injury, be it jumping off a building or being hit in the head with a bat.\nWhat is also particularly well done is the sense of group. There are many cliques within the class and the show masterfully mixes individual development with that of the group. In addition, there are also romantic developments between certain characters as well- this was particularly enjoyable for me.\nValue:\nDespite being quite long, I've re-watched this show multiple times and it's still great. It's a touching story with bits of hilarity and true to life ideas mixed in. This is storytelling and character development at its best. If you can live with the ecchi and naughty camera angles, this is definitely one show you shouldn't miss.\n        "},

What this show didn't say was how funny it was! Now Great Comedian Onizuko would've been a better name! Its not all laughs. Let me tell you about this crazy show and all the negatives with their positivs attached.\nFor the story we have a Great Teacher Onizuka coming from a life of badness and crime (which doesn't sound funny write? Well wait till he starts making his faces)! Somehow in a crazy plot twist I wont spoil here he becomes\n          \n        a crazy teacher. I tell you, this is where the show hits its first negativ: this show teaches nothing. Then on top of it all they have offensive smoking in it, and this is cartoon for the children of our future?\nI can tell you I didn't learn one thing from this Onyzuka show! Anyway, it follows the hilary of a crime man pursuing a teaching career by being totally a bad influence, like smoking and driving recklessly. He fights the power while wearing a funny face, and it's crazy!\nArt wise it looks crazy and liney but not too good. Why didnt they draw better? You know what they say; those who cant do something teach it insthead. Sometimes he looks all fat faced.\nSound has a good opening and very stylish sounding and looking. Otherways the show teaches nothing about music or sound. Great Teacher Onizuko is trying very hard to make himself sound like Spyke Spiegal from Cowboy Bebop AKA Stephen Jay Bloome.  \nIf you come into watching this because you want to learn or see cool drawings, you lose. If you just want to laugh at this show then you really win because it tacklees some good adult subject materiol. My kids liked the funny faces, but not a show for kids, either. Not a teaching show.\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Imagine yourself as a once feared member of a notorious gang, and now in your early 20's, you've decided to become a teacher to change student's lives. However, there is one problem: You're perverted, you've never been really smart, and you know you can't pass the teacher's examination.\nThis was the case for Eikichi Onizuka, 22 years old. However, he did have a lot of strong points.\nMAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS\nStory: After Onizuka Eikichi got employed at Holy Forest Academy. He was made in charge of the infamous class 2-4. They were known for shaking the foundations of teachers by doing horrible things to them. They made\n          \n        them look stupid by outsmarting them, torturing them by throwing water at them, and getting them fired through scandals such as taking girl's panties. They were notorious, but Onizuka was not afraid. He tamed them. One by one. That is the basis of this anime. Onizuka's quest to gain the trust of the students of class 2-4, and to have them believe that teachers are worthy of their respect. Of course, on the way, he'll still be trying to catch a glimpse of his female student's panties. You wouldn't want it any other way.\nArt: This is an old school anime. Art is not up to par as today's anime. But I enjoyed this artwork a lot more. The facial expressions are extremely well done and more realistic than recent anime artwork. The studio did not skip out on artwork to save money, but beautifully recreated the artwork of the manga as best as they could have for the anime. They did an excellent job. It reminds me of the artwork of Evangelion, and Slam Dunk.\nSound: There were two opening songs. Driver's High by L'arc~en~Ciel and Hitori No Yoru by Pornograffitti. These two songs made up the sound of the anime. I looked forward to hearing these songs with every episode I watched. They are very memorable. I do not usually watch the ending songs of anime unless they catch my interest from the first note, so the ending songs are much less memorable to me. The music of the anime seems nonexistent, but that is not a bad thing. It only means that it fit each scene perfectly and did not wreck the anime's mood. It was beautifully made.\nCharacter: Perhaps the best part of this anime were all the characters. The characters were beyond the story itself. Each new student that was introduced had a grudge against teachers and each of their grudges was shattered and their trust in teachers renewed by Onizuka. Each character also had their own special trait. They were well made and voice acted extremely well. Don't watch the dubbed version. It's a joke.\nEnjoyment: Perhaps one of the best shonen anime out there, I greatly enjoyed GTO. If you liked such anime such as FMA, Slam Dunk, and Evangelion, then I guarantee you'll love GTO. The story is simple, but it has a big heart and a big message behind it. The only reason this anime received a nine is because of the ending, but it has led me to reading the manga because I couldn't have enough of this anime.\nOverall: Watch it. You will not be disappointed.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    For 50 bucks I make up a badly researched theory about how Assassination Classroom is a prequel to GTO. Payment in advance, no refunds.\nStory:\nRemember when you were in school? Maybe you still are, but whether or not you’re already out, you certainly remember your teachers, don’t you? Wouldn’t you have wished for a cool motherfucker like Onizuka to teach you the really important stuff instead of Mister Snorebag teaching you geometry or the difference between Past Perfect and Present Perfect? Sorry, I’m having a mild case of PTSD here. Anyway, no matter how great it would be for the student body, it would cause major\n          \n        headaches to the school administration. And this is where we step in, as Onizuka constantly has to fight to keep his job after the most recent ruckus he caused. That’s an interesting story to tell, no doubt, but it gets sort of repetitive. I mean, how many times can the authorities excuse him for his behavior without getting fed up with it? I’d rather have seen more of his classes, which we sadly see very little of. Most of the problems he has with the students take place after school, during breaks or at night, so we never really witness how good a teacher he actually is. It takes a while before this pattern is softened up a little and around the middle of its run time, GTO loses much of its flavor thanks to this. The final episodes though are a lot of fun and the ending isn’t bad either. In total, GTO is fun at the start, gets a little boring after a while, but gets back up again as it’s nearing its closure.\n7/10\nArt:\nFor its time, GTO doesn’t look bad. The animation quality is acceptable most of the time, but there are a couple of (probably) budget induced less good ones here and there. As long as an anime knows when to do which, I can live with it and Onizuka does it in the right spots mostly, so there’s no real problem. The character design tries to show us more realistic looking people, which gives the show a more realistic touch (obviously). I don’t know if that was necessary, as GTO does like to take a step back from reality for comedic purposes every now and then, but the majority of it doesn’t, so I guess in the end, it was a good choice. Kanzaki is somewhat of an exception to this rule, with her (non-colored?) blonde hair and heterochromia. But she’s special anyway. Also, it looks cool.\n8/10\nSound:\nThe first opening is considered an all-time classic and I see no reason why it shouldn't. The song is good, the riff is awesome, it fits the show, the animation to it is great, what’s not to love? The second isn’t as iconic, but it’s a pretty solid one too. Both ending songs work as well. The rest of the soundtrack didn’t feel that special to me, but as you know, that’s hardly a disaster. I enjoyed the over the top voice acting of the cast, made them sound just the right amount of ridiculous and not too corny. However, compared to the delivery of other anime, GTO falls a little flat in this regard, mostly due to the “just okay” work done on the side characters. The sound effects were well done, like Onizuka’s bike for example, something I often miss to mention but wanted to this time, because I really liked how natural they sounded.\n8/10\nCharacters:\nThe world of GTO seems to be filled with horrible people and utterly stupid idiots. Many of the folks who want Onizuka gone are just really mean and awful persons, who either do it for their own benefit or they aim for disproportionate retribution. I get it, Eikichi is the good guy (somewhat), but man, if you let so many dogs loose you should have more variety in your villains. Most of them are still entertaining, especially the vice principal, who I felt a bit sorry for in the end. The best opponent he had was without a doubt Kanzaki. That girl was a lot of fun, outsmarting Onizuka all the time and just very, very mean-spirited (and enjoying it nonetheless). Things became much more enjoyable after her introduction, especially since Onizuka’s supporters finally had a voice of reason. That is something that bugged me slightly, the sheer stupidity of the characters. I understand that Onizuka is a complete idiot, after all, that’s the base of the comedy, but most other people seemed to be too. Most of the villain’s motives were very shallow and not infrequently totally uncalled for. This is something that goes hand in hand with the repetitiveness of the story earlier on. In general, I feel that a better cast would have made this show a tad more enjoyable.\n5/10\nEnjoyment:\nGreat Teacher Onizuka was quite enjoyable, but it had its flaws. At a length of 43 episodes, it’s only natural for them to be a bigger thorn in one’s eye than it would be the case in a 12-episode anime. I still think it was worth the watch, because when GTO was good, it was pretty good. Some arcs, like the Okinawa trip, were top-notch entertainment and kept me coming back and endure the weaker stories. Some of the morals and messages were a little odd to me, but by now I learned how the Japanese society thinks about certain life aspects, especially back in the 90s, so I can more or less ignore these. GTO certainly is a product of its time, but it’s also no doubt one of the better.\n7/10\nOverall:\n7.0/10\n        "},

This is probably due to the sole fact that Great Teacher Onizuka (GTO) came out back in 1999. Both returning stars in Studio Pierrot and director Noriyuki Abe whom previously worked on the great shounen series Yu Yu Hakusho, picked an anime that was a little out of their norm. Previously their norm was simple plot action series, but changing to straight comedy ended up working out for the “shounen” studio and director.\nGTO focuses on 22 year old ex biker gang leader Eikichi Onizuka. Needless\n          \n        to say, his ambitious new goal is to become the best teacher in the world with his reformed self. Oh, and to pick up hot high school girls in the process. He goes through teacher training, homeroom teacher responsibilities, and of course seems to get the worst class at which ever school he gets the pleasure of working at. The students put him through terrible instances that would drive a normal teacher crazy or get them fired. Luckily, Onizuka doesn’t believe in conventional rules to fix these broken students.\nFor the time and even future, GTO music hits all of the right marks. Animation and art style is just as unconventional as Onizuka’s teaching abilities. Studio Pierrot is never known for high budget animation, but the different art style of the GTO manga translates well to make this anime and make it lasting long term. Although characters are fairly arche-typed such as a hacker student and ditz big breasted girl, and each person seemingly has the same face as the person next to them. Basically not much different than what was seen in Initial D.\nGTO fits and knows what it is from the start. It is a crazy over the top comedy about Onizuka teaching these terrible students moral lessons and values even though they want nothing more than to ruin him. GTO is done perfectly in this sense. Some may think that the humour is a bit repetitive and juvenile, and that’s ok to believe in it. What’s more disappointing is the abrupt halt the series gets as it was cancelled at 43 episodes with more manga to go. \nOverall, this is an anime that must be watched or tried just for the fact of the reputation GTO has in the anime world. Its’ crazy comedy yet somehow keeping a serious moral tone just works. Sure, sometimes this kind of comedy isn’t for everybody, but in the end it is all about if the viewer was entertained. Let’s just say the manga was ordered to continue this hilarious adventure."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    REVIEW OF THE ANIME AND THE LIVE-ACTION VERSION!\nAnime\nOne word perfectly describes GTO. BITCHIN. Great Teacher Onizuka is one hell of a bitchin anime. It has a unique setting with a surprisingly amazing story.\nStory - A show about an ex-biker gang member who's dream is to become a teacher. At first I didn't think much of this premise, but my friend kept telling me it was a great show so I decided to give it a try. Amazingly enough it turned out to be excellent. The story is one of a kind. This show actually spurred a live action version in Japan. The live-action is pretty\n          \n        good too.\nArt - At first I didn't think much of the art. It didn't look that great to me, but when Onizuka makes one of his infamous facial expressions, you can't help but burst out laughing. I have never seen an anime with such ridiculous yet realistic facial expressions before in my life.\nSound - I dont remember. :( I watched this anime a while ago and can't remember what I thought of the music but I can safely say the live-action versions music what GREATO!.\nCharacters - All good ranging from shy to outgoing. You never end up hating any of the characters, because in the end they all turn out to be misguided youths who just need some guidance and direction.\nJust a heads up, the last ten seconds of the show are extremely funny if you live in California. You'll know what I'm talking about.\nLive-Action\nThe live-action version is 13 episodes, each 40 minutes long. There were several notable changes made in the live-action version. A few new characters were added, and a few were removed. A few of the stories were slightly altered though this was not necessarily a bad thing.\nThe live-action version of Great Teacher Onizuka also has a different feel to it than the anime. While the anime tends to be a combination of comedy and drama, the live-action version leans more toward the drama side though it has its moments. Actually, when the season finale was aired in Japan, it broke a record for most people who tuned in to watch a program. Though many changes were made, the live-action version of Great Teacher Onizuka manages to retain the original spirit of the anime.\nOne thing to note is that the acting is over exaggerated in the live-action version. From my experience, this tends to be fairly common in Asian movies and shows. So if this doesn't bother you, then you will most likely find this version of GTO quite entertaining.\nI give the live-action version a 9 out of 10. During almost every episode I got super teary eyed during the climaxes (I know embarrassing). So if you tend to get teary eyed while watching animes then be sure to watch the live-action GTO alone to save yourself the embarrassment. \n        "},

Despite now nearing its 16th birthday the show is as hilarious, uplifting and engaging as ever.  If you watch it and don’t laugh your joyless, if you watch it and don’t smile your heartless. A classic to say the least, I recommend it to any anime fan."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    My Written Review of GTO Video Review.\nStory - 10/10\nThe story of GTO is rather unique. It centres around an ex-gang biker who’s decided to become a teacher. Not only a teacher, but the greatest teacher in the world. Now you’re wondering how could he pull this off, he’s an ex criminal with a second-rate college teaching degree. Eikichi Onizuka surprisingly gets himself hired by a school to teach, despite his unconventional and rule breaking teaching methods. The reason why he is hired is because the class that he is assigned to is the delinquent class 3-4 of Holy Forest Academy. \nNow throughout the series Onizuka\n          \n        will venture into the world of self-discovery. He’ll learn what it is to become a great teacher through his students. And because of this, each story arc is focus on a student he is dealing with. Now some arcs can sort of drag on more than it should, for the most part it is very enjoyable.\nThe thing this series does very well is how realistic it can be and how overly the top fun it can be. GTO has a great balance between real life drama and exaggerated humour. Which I think is the series strong point. The show doesn’t take itself too seriously, but in a way still feels like this could actually happened without that exaggerated humour added towards it. \nNow even though each story arc Onizuka deals with another student, it is not episodic by any means. There is a good progression as Onizuka starts as the hated teacher then becomes the great teacher he sets out to be.\nCharacters - 10/10\nLets start with the main star of the show. Eikichi Onizuka, 22 Years old also known as Great Teacher Onikuza or GTO for short. I don’t have to get into too much detail about Onizuka’s background as I’ve already done that. Now even though Onizuka is a teacher, he hates forcing the traditional teaching methods on students as he believes it’s better to solve their problems and their needs by making them enjoy life. \nNow even though Onizuka solves most problems probably the dumbest ways possible, he somehow manages to pull through. And it’s the path and methods he chooses which make it so enjoyable, he turns every day activates into something fun. I think this is why Onizuka is such a loveable character he’s the cool teacher friend you want to have, because he’ll always side with you. Despite how much you annoy him.\nThe class that Onizuka teaches is class 3-4 which is known as the worst class in the school’s history. Now the students of class 3-4 come in a range of different personalities. You have weak unpopular kids, the smart kids, the bullies etc. Now no matter how different each kids are, they all have a common goal, which they succeeded on every occasion. That goal is, to get rid of Onizuka. The class is known for being a group of misfits who prey on teachers and just try to get whoever teaches them fired, because they simply cannot trust teachers and you’ll learn later on.\nBecause of the variety of characters, the story goes through many arcs, which can make it feel very episodic, but there is a progression, because through each story line Onizuka gains more respect over time.\nAnimation - 9/10\nGTO an anime originally being released in 1999, its art style is rather dated. It’s quite hard to review animation coming from the late 90s compared to these days. But what I think what the animation does so well, is the expressions on the characters faces, they come out with the funniest, retarded most over exaggerated face faults I have seen in anime which is a huge plus adding towards their funny writing as well. The animators weren’t shy in breaking that wall to make it over to, even though the setting is slice of life.\nEnjoyment - 10/10\nThis is the type of anime you’re going to have to watch, if you’re an anime fan. It is one of the funniest anime I’ve seen ever, in my opinion. Everyone has their own taste. The story may seem simple, a teacher tries to gain the trusts of his students, but it gets rather deep and the execution is perfect. Onizuka gets things done in a cool way, but while accomplishing them, he makes it look stupid as well. The jokes are great, you’re going to laugh. The Openings and Endings don’t really fit the show’s sense of humour that much, but they feel rather inspirational just like the teacher Onizuka is. He is the teacher you want to look up to\nVerdict\nGreat Teacher Onizuka probably one of the best anime’s a I’ve seen and definitely one of my favourites I’ve seen, despite its out-dated graphics it still blends very well with its genre. I’m going to give Great Teacher Onizuka, GTO a 9.5/10. There is no such thing as a perfect, only some story dragged on more than it should, but it’s because the series is so engaging fun and deep, it gets you really hooked.\n"},

Onizuka é ex-membro de uma gangue da pesada em Shonan, sendo ele o antigo chefe, mas acaba tornando-se professor, realizando o seu sonho. Digamos que GTO é a continuação do famoso mangá de briga de rua, bem sangrento por sinal, chamado Shonan Junai Gumi (meu mangá favorito). Aqui é mostrado uma comédia sem igual, junto a milhares de memes e referências das outras animações populares (Barakamon, Hokuto no Ken, etc), porém, o brilho desta grande obra não se baseia apenas no humor, mas sim, nas milhares de mensagens que são retratadas, servindo como uma lição de vida a cada episódio.\nSinopse:\nEikichi Onizuka é um rapaz de 22 anos que no seu tempo de escola era líder de uma gangue de motociclistas da pesada e faixa preta em karate. Depois de se formar numa faculdade de quinta-categoria em Estudos Sociais, resolve exercer a profissão de professor, mesmo não tendo a mínima aptidão para o cargo. Com muito sacrifício, Onizuka consegue um emprego em um colégio e vai dar aula para uma turma fora do normal. Utilizando métodos pouco convencionais, ele procura colocar seus alunos na linha, tornando-se amigo, compreendendo-os e mostrando a eles que um professor também possui sentimentos (do modo mais difícil para eles). E claro, aproveitando pra ver as garotas de uniforme escolar e tentar conquistar Azusa Fuyutsuki, uma professora da mesma escola. (o príncipal motivo dele querer se tornar professor é por que na cabeça retardada dele, ele vai poder ter relações sexuais com suas alunas quando elas forem mais velhas, e se casar com uma delas, sendo assim, talvez quando ele tiver 40 anos, ela vai ter 30, e por ai vai, mas isso é só um objetivo inicial, a história toma um rumo totalmente diferente... O Onizuka percebe que seu papel é transformar a escola em um lugar divertido, então tenta fazer amizade com seus alunos, e é ai que entra o drama, a maior parte de seus alunos acaba tendo algum problema durante a história, e é o Onizuka quem terá de resolver)\nPersonagens (Não vou colocar muitos por causa dos Spoilers):\nOnizuka Eikichi, um rapaz de 22 anos, ex-membro de uma gangue de motoqueiros em Shonan, chamado Oni-Baku, porém, ainda virgem. O principal protagonista de toda a obra, sendo ele o professor. Este adora botar pressão em seus alunos para que eles façam seus favores com métodos meio ortodóxos, além de ser um grande pervertido, sempre magoando a professora Fuyutsuki, mulher que começa a gostar dele. O mais interessante sobre Eikichi é sua lealdade com os seus alunos, capaz de arriscar a própria vida por cada um deles, ele é na minha opinião o personagem mais engraçado dos animes, e o melhor também.\nDanma Ryuji, é o melhor amigo de Onizuka desde o fundamental, com um passado como co-fundador do Oni-Baku de Shonan, mas agora ele mantém sua paixão pelas motos junto ao seu trabalho como mecânico, abrindo o seu próprio workshop. Este se envolve nas aventuras de Eikichi, sempre dando bons conselhos para o amigo, sendo o mais maduro dos três, já que ainda tem o Saejima, o mais safado de todos. Sua namorada, Nagisa Nagase, também faz sua presença, no entanto, acabou sendo pouco explorada, onde foi apenas bem desenvolvida em Shonan Junai Gumi. (Recomendo muito que leiam Bad Company e Shonan Junai Gumi, explicarei depois o que são eles)\nSaejima, Ex-delinquente e amigo de Onizuka e Ryuji desde o ensino médio, sendo um homem extremamente violento, com uma ferocidade de dar medo, onde foi apelidado de \"Cão Furioso de Kamakura\". Na trama atual, ele é um policial que sempre acaba envolvido em casos sujos, além de ser corrupto e traiçoeiro, facilitando o contrabando de coisas ilegais para pedir favor e favorecer a si mesmo, roubando os criminosos. Onizuka sempre acaba lhe metendo em confusões, inclusive com a própria Yakuza.\nFuyutsuki Azusa, umna Professora que acaba desenvolvendo sentimentos românticos por Onizuka, admirando-o pelo seu esforço, garra e determinação pelos alunos, junto aos grandes conselhos. Diferente do nosso ex-delinquente, ela se formou em uma faculdade prestigiada de Tokyo, Waseda, ganhando o diploma em literatura. Sua personalidade, até então, é de uma moça gentil e calma, mas ela não consegue ter um relacionamento muito bom com suas alunas por ser uma mulher bem bonita.\nUchyamada, não vou falar muito sobre ele por que seria um pouco de spoiler, mas ele é engraçado pra caralho, tem um ódio cômico muito forte pelo Onizuka devido a algumas coisas acontecidas na história, RIP Cresta\nSobre a Trilha Sonora:\nSerei sincero, a trilha sonora é um ponto altíssimo da obra, simplesmente porque combina com as cenas, tornando-se exatamente o tipo de música que segue com a premissa que a trama oferece, já que não importa o tipo de gosto músical que a pessoa tem, afinal, a única coisa onde realmente interessa é se a trilha consegue se encaixar nos determinados acontecimentos introduzidos no anime, ganhando um ótimo destaque. Sua opening da segunda temporada ganhou o prêmio de melhor abertura da animação japonesa em 2000. Inclusive recomendo que veja as openings e endings, as openings vão ser MUITO estranhas de começo, mas depois acostuma, hoje quando vejo as openings já fico louco de tanto que gosto delas...\nE agora o maior ponto fraco do anime, a Animação:\nA animação pode não ser uma das melhores, mas é boa pra sua época, com paisagens e cenários simples, seguindo o padrão tradicional dos animes clássicos, nada de impressionante, mas não se enganem, os detalhes e caricaturas cômicas dos personagens, conseguem ser incríveis, principalmente o Onizuka, sendo uma fonte inesgotável de memes. Dos poucos combates mostrados, eles chegam a ter um ótimo trabalho, claro, junto ao humor cheio de referências. Um fator interessante, realmente, são as perseguições engraçadas, fugindo de gangues ou, até mesmo, policiais, mostrando um grande exagero sem igual. O estilo de arte é simples e funcional, e é altamente reminiscente do mangá original, e adivinha, foi animado pela Pierrot, mas ficou boa a animação, graças a deus.\nConclusão/Opinião:\nAcredito fielmente que para qualquer tipo de anime do gênero comédia, devem conter grandes situações e ótimos personagens. GTO consegue misturar essa receita de maneira inteligente e empolgante, fazendo com que nós, acabemos gostando da trama, nos mostrando situações divertidas, amorosas, intrigantes e agradáveis, já que esta obra é uma salada misturada com tudo que há de bom.\nO drama consegue ser bem convincente em milhares de aspectos relacionados à vida humana ou, até mesmo, casos amorosos, onde o professor ajuda os seus alunos como pode, sendo aquele tipo de pessoa que qualquer um de nós desejaríamos que existisse nas escolas. Great Teacher Onizuka é um anime escolar totalmente diferente dos muitos títulos modernos, que conseguem ser melodramáticos ou artificiais, perdendo o impacto necessário do gênero e dificilmente desenvolvendo qualquer tipo de vínculo com GTO, tornando este grande anime um clássico único.\nO ecchi aqui, consegue ser muito leve, realmente é só em momentos graciosos, nada demais, seguindo aquela pegada clichê das camêras, o que achei bem interessante por sinal, não sendo tão apelativo igual a outros. Os personagens são tão interessantes, que suas verdadeiras personalidades apenas são mostradas no momento em que Onizuka consegue mudá-los.\nNessa obra existem várias referências de outros animes e filmes, como Hokuto no Ken, Instinto Selvagem, O Grito, Barakamon, Initial D,etc. Isso acaba enriquecendo demais a trama, mostrando o tipo de humor negro nas cenas introduzidas. O ritmo dos primeiros episódios são bem rápidos, porém, a segunda parte começa a ser mais lenta, mas não atrapalha em nada, pelo contrário, acabamos nos envolvendo demais na história.\nCuriosidades:\nGTO uns 2 J-Dramas e um lá de Taiwan, algo do tipo, não entendo muito dessas coisas e não achei certinho por ai na internet\nO ultimo episódio de um desses J-Dramas de acordo com a  TOKYOPOP, foi o programa mais visto de todos os tempos na televisão japonesa\nTem alguns outros mangás relacionados a GTO e tem spin offs também, olha eles mais embaixo\nMangás relacionados/Spin Offs\nComeçando com Bad Company, que é uma prequel de Shonan Junai Gumi, que é quase uma prequel de GTO, que viagem é essa véi, que mostra como o Onizuka e o Ryuji realmente se conheceram, é um mangá pequeno (só 10 capítulos), mas é um mangá muito foda, a maneira em que o Ryuji conheceu o Onizuka também foi muito foda, além disso nesse mangá descobrimos que o Ryuji é tão forte que pode distorcer o espaço tempo com um soco kkkkk\nShonan Junai Gumi, é quase uma prequel de GTO, vou explicar quando eu chegar no Shonan Seven, que é outro mangá, Shonan Junai Gumi conta a história de Onizuka e Ryuji, dois delinquentes em uma missão impossível de perderem a virgindade com lindas garotas japonesas, e nessas tentativas vão se envolver em várias confusões e tal, é muita comédia, ri demais com essa coisa linda, mas não é só comédia, o drama é muito bom, conseguiu me deixar na bad, coisa que quase nenhum anime ou mangá chegou nem perto de fazer, recomendo muito\nShonan 14 Days é uma side story que se passa no penúltimo arco de GTO, nessa história o Onizuka volta a Shonan por 14 dias(Shonan é o local onde se passou o mangá Shonan Junai Gumi) lá ele conhece uma amiga da Azusa (já citei antes então não vou explicar sobre a Azusa) que sabe muito sobre ele e pede pra ele cuidar de algumas crianças no orfanato e tal, esse eu nem li ainda kkkkkkk, tive que pegar uma mini sinopse, mas o cara que fez a sinopse disse que isso é quase tão bom quanto o próprio GTO, então to com um hype em cima desse\nGTO: Paradise Lost, é a continuação de GTO, no qual Onizuka foi preso por algum motivo e agora conta suas histórias para os presos, é basicamentei isso a sinopse que me passaram, nem li ainda, não me preocupo muito com essa parte já que estou só falando sobre outras obras do Fujisawa, que tem algo a ver com GTO mas não precisamos ler elas pra ver GTO, então ta tranquilo\nGTR(Great Transporter Ryuji), conta a história do Ryuji aparentemente no mesmo tempo de Paradise Lost, no qual ele se aventurava fazendo corridas clandestinas pela cidade com sua mulher Nagase Nagisa, infelizmente o mangá foi cancelado, mas se tivesse sido continuado, tenho certeza que seria tão bom quanto GTO\nIno-Head Gargoyle, um FODENDO SPIN OFF DO SAEJIMA, conta as histórias do Saejima vivendo por ai, só sei disso, mas disseram que é MUITO engraçado\nShonan Seven, então, lembra quando falei que Shonan Junai Gumi é \"quase\" uma prequel de GTO? na verdade GTO é meio que independente de Shonan Junai Gumi, apesar de terem ligações, mas Shonan Junai Gumi é realmente uma prequel de outro mangá, é o Shonan Seven, que conta a história de Ikki Kurogami que começa novos dias de aula na escola que antigamente estudavam Onizuka e Ryuji, e o nome do mangá se dá ao fato de que no momento em que o mangá se passa, existe meio que uma competição entre os delinquentes das escolas, basicamente entre 7 escolas vão ter os 7 mais fortes, que vão ter sete fodendo motos para cada, e Ikki e seus amigos vão nessa jornada pra se tornarem os mais fodas\nCONCLUSÕES FINAIS\nGTO É FODA PORRA "},

You get something wonderful, and that something is called GTO. The series tempers itself with a grounding in reality and addresses serious social issues, but by mixing raunchy humor with a bit of an edge, Onizuka's lovable-loser-with-attitude persona, and a collection of wild situations that any prime-time comedy would be proud to sport, GTO distinguishes itself as a creative, enjoyable, and very funny show.\nAt first, I\n          \n        wasn't quite sure what to make of GTO; the sexual themes come on pretty strong, and between Onizuka's skirt-chasing and torturing his students, this didn't look to be a series in very good taste. Actually, I was missing the point: GTO is less a schoolyard drama and more like a modern-day fairy tale about a very human knight in all-too tarnished armor, fighting against conformity and the 'right' way to do things. Once I stopped taking it too seriously, I started having an absolutely grand time.\nOnizuka at first may look like a simple skirt chaser, but there's oh-so-much-more to him than your average skirt-chasing creep, even though the TV version has less character development than in the comics. On one hand, his main interest in teaching seems to be the (female) students (and fellow teachers, for that matter), and he's certainly got a wandering eye, summed up in a hilarious scene early on where he surveys a schoolyard filled entirely with high school girls--the pan was captioned with 'There are boys, but he only sees the girls.' On the other, he's a hard-driving Karate champ badass with plenty of biker gang leader attitude to back it up. In between, he's an emotionally fragile loser with no life, less social skills, a good heart, and an honest desire to give kids a better educational experience than he had.\n        "},

From hilarious humor,art, plot to the soundtrack,characters. Everything fits perfectly in this little masterpiece.  But let's just stick to the basics.\nStory : The story is nothing groundbreaking. Our hero after a turbulent life of a biker/delinquent decides that the next step in his life is to become a teacher. He gets a job + a class full of evil genius/ teacher hating type high school students trying to relieve him of the job. But\n          \n        don't let that be in the way because the story holds quite a bit of surprises to keep you more than interested.\nArt : Art is nothing to write home about but it still holds the fort seeing as it's almost 13 years old. The facial expressions are priceless, keeping you grinning even after the show is over. But art too isn't the most important part of GTO-s charm.\nCharacters : Now this is where the fun begins. Onizuka Eikichi, one of the most hilarious and memorable characters. From 'fall of your chair funny to drop dead serious' he is almost impossible not to like. Armed with street smarts, iron willed, perverted but on the other hand kind and always ready to help his students no matter the problem.\nRest of the cast including students and fellow teachers is memorable in its special way too.. From geniuses to slow ones, from delinquents to nerds/geeks, you have it all.. Everything to keep you entertained.\nGTO embraces slice of life genre too, and it has its heart- tugging moments but where this show excels is humor and extremely high fun factor that will leave you wanting to rewatch the whole series again. The only downpoint of the series is the abrubt and forced ending. And even that can't keep me from giving this show a clean 10 and to recommend it to every anime fan! \n        "},

Onizuka the main protagonist of this series however is as the title may  suggest, a teacher that can best be described as a very fun person full of honesty and qualities that allow his students to see him as their friend  rather than authority. \nStory and Plot:  7   The pemise is simple, you have a young violent looking biker from the streets in his early\n          \n        20s applying to the position of a teacher in hopes of getting to know and meet young girls since he cant find a girlfriend.\nObstacles such  as  his lack in knowledge and experience hinder him at first, but he never really loses hope or sees himself as a victim, even though he has many enemies at first. The show focuses on comedy a lot and makes it feel natural  by implementing things like pranks by students that we can relate to. You also have your fair share of drama, but while in many shows comedy can ruin drama or make it seem forced, gto manages to balance both well by having a good transition between drama and comedy. What bothered me was that there sometimes was too much plot convience for onizuka and some actions and plans kinda leave no real suspense and so you only have the comedic and the philosophic aspects of the show to look forward to, since you know that he will master all challenges and cant get seriously hurt or lose in any way. \nCharacters: Perhaps the selling point of gto are the characters, since the comedy and dramatic events are all driven by problems certain students/teachers/onizuka have that require onizuka to understand and solve them, you get an in depth view into the life of a lot of charcters. These problems exist in the real world as well and make the characters seem more alive and real. Onizuka has many facettes as he once was a gang leader and can sometimes be serious even though he most of the time is acting stupid and funny. His motto is openly expressing himself and saying and doing whatever he feels like.\nWhile onizukas fleshed out character stays consistent througout the show and changes in some situations only to get a soft reset later, his students actually get character development under his influence. \n\nArt and Sound: 9 The soundtracks in gto are addictive and fitting to the situation they play at, i especially liked the ones playing at funny scenes.\nThe visuals are good for the age the series has. Both aspects convey the mood very well.\nEnjoyment: 10 From the comedic moments to onizukas crazy stunts and lectures about life: I loved every second of this show and wish retro shows like this back instead of the moe highscholl shit we have today.\nOverall: 8.8   A great show with greater life lessons and lectures and most teachers irl have to offer and the greates teacher our there: onizuka\n"},

Almost every episode was filled with scenes to bring humor and laughter to the viewer. I loved that about this anime, even if the jokes could sometimes be repetitive. Furthermore, I loved how the anime switches from serious to comedic in such an non- obvious way. Nonetheless, the anime had some negative aspects to it as well. With genres like slice of life and school I expected a realistic\n          \n        feeling type of anime. Some of the aspects of this anime was overly dramatic. For example jumping off a building and not expecting to die kind of events were happening. Do not get me wrong I understand that in the realm of anime anything is possible. However, the \"anything\" aspects need to line up with the overall purpose/ feel of the anime.\nCharacter Development- There was little to no character development for any of the characters. This is highly disappointing because this is an 43 episode anime. Each character more or less stuck in there ways. However, if you look at the overall anime there is nothing much to develop! The plot/story line is clear and the characters play their designated role in the story perfectly. \nOverall- I enjoyed the anime, and would recommend it for 24 plus to watch this. At certain scenes it can get a little R rated (Nothing Huge). It had a whole bunch of laughs and light moments. It never went off topic... it stayed on plot and remained focus on the overall goal of the entire anime.\nI LOVED IT. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I put off watching Great Teacher Onizuka for a long time due to ti's age and the fact that it seemed like it would just be downright boring and repetitive. I decided to give it a try when I had nothing to do, and I'm glad I did. GTO is an incredibly well done comedy that had me in stitches but also nearly brought me to tears.\nStory:\nOnizuka is a 22 year old reformed biker gang leader that decides to shape up and become a teacher, except he mainly wants to meet teenage girls. This set up leads to a hilarious situation to base the story\n          \n        from. Onizuka is pitted against incredibly intelligent students that want him to resign, the character arcs are all entertaining and have some sort of emotional/dramatic payoff that make it worth it. They're not just stages for Onizuka to pull off some grandiose gag, he genuinely cares for his students and he does his best to help them. As the story progresses Onizuka and his students work against all odds to keep Onizuka's job while Onizuka comes to realize why they wanted to get rid of him in the first place. This backbone for each arc is what separates GTO from an average sketch comedy, the story doesn't reset after each arc. The final episodes are great and really demonstrate how the story comes together. There are a few issues such as one arc being somewhat incomplete, and the romantic development between Onizuka and Fuyutski taking too much of a sideline at times but altogether GTO has a really good story.\n8/10\nArt: \nGTO is old, it finished airing in 2000. The art style is dated and the animation is a little less smooth than modern anime. Other than that GTO has an endearing style and everything seems to pop, the directing is good and there are some scenes that are genuinely beautiful even by modern standards. Plus Onizuka and the VP's reaction faces are great.\n7/10\nSound:\nThe voices were well done, Onizuka and the VP really stood out. There were certain students that weren't that well voiced but overall it was good. The music and sound effects are nice as well, and the OP and ED are top notch. L'arc en Ciel's Drivers High is an amazing track for the first opening and for driving scenes, it really elevates the action to the next level.\n8/10\nCharacters:\nComedies tend to have flat characters, or characters that fit right into a certain archetype and really don't break the mold at all. In GTO the main characters are well developed and they grow as the show progresses. As Onizuka recruits students to his side they develop and change as if they were real students who were mentored by their teacher. Even the flat side characters are fun and shine in their own way.Standout characters would be Onizuka, Fuyutski, Kikuchi, and Anko. Each character seems to have a reasoning for their actions and they all play well off of eachother. GTO's characters are one of the aspects that sets it apart from other comedy anime.\n10/10\nEnjoyment:\nGTO quite possibly has the strongest first episode of any anime I've seen, it's up there with Steins;Gate in my opinion. Just the first episode has my laughing like crazy and on the brink of tears. They pulled no punches with the comedy and it really sets a high bar for the show. The rest of the show meets that bar or exceeds it, I finished all 43 episodes in three days. I couldn't stop watching. GTO is one of the few anime that I felt the need keep watching episode after episode. It's a wild ride full of laughs and emotions.\n10/10\nOverall:\nGTO sets the bar for comedy anime, it's a classic that every anime fan needs to see. Stop putting it off and watch GTO. I consider it a masterpiece.\nTeacher Banzai!!!\n10/10\n        "},

But the series is old so it's fair for it's time hence I can forgive the lapses in quality at various points, especially as the series wasn't Unlimited Budget Works.\nThe character design in the series is nice too, the style is typical of the time and I think whether you like it or not comes down to taste. There are generic and stereotypical designs with the occasional clearly different one who will become a main character for a story line, however this is the case with all the anime I've watched (as far as I can think) so it's not something I can complain about.\n\nAudio in the series is done very well in my opinion as the voices generally match the character designs to a t, especially Onizuka, Wataru Takagi plays the role brilliantly and conveys the emotions and feelings of him very well to the audience. Again however the actual quality of the sound is clearly old sounding and doesn't match up to modern standards in all aspects.\nCharacters in the series are very nicely done, showing true development from hating Onizuka and trying all they can to rid the school of him, to of course no avail, then wanting him to stay around and doing all they can to help achieve that. (I don't really think that's a spoiler because that's what development is on a generic level.) \nThe students who Onizuka takes under his wing all develop in a clear repetitive way this is true, but never do I find myself bored of the plot lines in any situation due to the always present comedy of the series.\nSo as an overall series the enjoyment factor for me was out of this world and I've watched this series 3 times at the current date, I also recommend it to anyone who even plans on watching it or hasn't watched it, even if they have they should watch it again. 10/10 Masterful series.\n        "},

He is an ex motorcycle gang member, has ear piercings, dyed blond hair, picks his nose and scratches himself in public wear he probably shouldn't and is more immature than his students. His enemies hate him and his friends think he is an idiot yet somehow he comes out looking good and you never know if he means it or not or if he\n          \n        is highly intelligent as is sometimes suggested or as stupid as he appears.\nHe is given the most difficult class to teach at the private Holy Cross Forest Academy who have forced to quit a string of teachers but they have met in Onizuka their most difficult challenge. Despite their scheming he slowly wins them over and gains their \"respect\".\nHe does this by helping them with their problems outside of school and their insecurities whilst teaching them about life normally by some grand gesture such as getting shot by Yazuka or jumping of a bridge with one of students on the back sometimes with the help of his questionable friends. Otherwise he just takes his students out of school on extra curricular activities which he really, and I mean really, shouldn't.\nWhat makes GTO great is that for such a large cast the characters are developed well much of it done with out Onizuka in the scene so the anime is not overly dependent on Onizuka especially when it comes to the students. The students problems are also believable such as bullying, dealing with an abnormal intellect making you smarter than the teachers, a father having an affair or a friend committing suicide.\nAll in all GTO is a classic anime with a great stories and great character. Unfortunately the animation now looks a bit dated but it compares much better than a lot of anime's of its time.\nOne negative note though, I have to say I didn't like the ending.\n        "},

This anime is hilarious at some points and downright serious at others, but in either case, the effect is poignant.\nThe anime revolves around Eikichi Onizuka (22 years old, single - you'll get why I have to add that if you watch the anime), former leader of the formidable Shonan bike gang, who is aspiring to be a teacher.  Despite his incredible street cred in leading a gang, he is surprisingly the most gullible character in the series.  He consistently falls for his students' pranks, which involve some\n          \n        means to try and get him fired, but in the end he always manages to avoid that outcome and WITHOUT ever blaming any of the students who tried to set him up.  I find that the writers had a great imagination in executing each arc this way and each turn of events always had some amount of surprise factor.  In any case, this anime will keep you on your toes.  Story: 10\nThe A/V was decent, I would go so far to say 'good' for something released in the early 2000s.  As another reviewer pointed out, Onizuka often makes this weird facial expression but as they mentioned, you get used to it after a view episodes.  Music was not bad and fitting to this style of anime.  A/V: 7\nCharacter development is really the area in which this anime shines.  The character of Onizuka himself doesn't change noticeably throughout the series.  Rather, the way in which he changes the character of all his students and, to some extent, other teachers such as his touted love interest Tsukasa Fuyutsuki is what I admire about this series.  Character: 10\nThis anime does a great job making you hate the students who bully other students and otherwise try to get Onizuka fired.  And then you realize later that they have legit reasons for what they're doing and aren't just heartless pricks.  This emotion is repeated over and over again and never gets old.  I'm giving enjoyment a 9 only because the whole Onizuka x Fuyutsuki thing didn't really go anywhere and I was hoping there would be at least one episode of serious intimacy between the two of them (it reaches the tipping point at times but never breaks through).  Enjoyment: 9\nIn sum, it's a great anime, and I highly recommend it if you find yourself with 15 hours of nothing to do.  Overall: 9\n        "},

The best thing about this show is Onizuka’s personality it is basically the reason the show is so popular and the nice thing is that he sticks to it the whole way.  \nVoices:\nThe voices all fit the character and there isn't really anything that you can argue about, OF COARSE I’m talking about the Japanglish (jap dub eng sub) ones. The Eng DUB is painfully funny to watch in my opinion.

GTO revolves around the life of Eikichi Onizuka, who was formerly in a bike gang, and his career in education, all while trying to get each of his students in his class to trust him. \nIf you're new to anime or haven't seen this series before, just stop reading this and watch the first episode. It's worth the watch. \nStory- 9/10\nThere are a few episodes per student (that is major in the plot) that shows how he goes to far lengths just to get\n          \n        them to open to him and to trust him. He does this all while doing stuff that would make you laugh (If you're into dumb jokes and situational humor). Seeing how he works his way up is very enjoyable and I believe many would like seeing this. Not to mention, there are scenes where you can get indulged in, especially scenes when things work out against Onizuka and you can't help but root for him and hope he can make it through. \nArt- 10/10\nConsidering that I myself am a fan of 1990's Anime Art, the art is very nice for the series (considering that it came out in 1999), and what makes the art enjoyable are the facial expression shown by characters. This is especially the case with Onizuka and the Vice-Principal Uchiyamada when something ridiculous occurs. \nSound- 8/10\nThe OST for this anime is very good. The 1st and 2nd OPs are very catchy and great to listen to, and the songs played in various scenes fit perfectly to the atmosphere of the show. Sincerely, I do recommend for people to listen to the OPs, which are among my favorite in all the Animes I have seen. \nCharacter- 10/10\nThe Characters in GTO are very enjoyable and I came to love the characters and their dynamics/relationships with both Onizuka and each other. It's nice to see various characters and their pasts and you get to understand how they are with these explanations, that at the end, you can't really hate any of them. Each of them have their own quirks and personalities that make them pretty memorable. \nEnjoyment- 9/10\nWhile there were many episodes that were interesting, there were a few scenes that would bore me and I wouldn't really pay attention to. For the most part though, the series had both funny moments that would make me laugh in my seat or bed (depends on when I saw it), and it had moments where you'd feel pensive and learn from the lessons the show gave, especially when Onizuka talks with the students. \nOverall- 10/10\nConsidering this is one of the first Animes I completed (Completed in July 2016), this was a very memorable series that I loved dearly. This show has many features that make it enjoyable, so I feel anyone can enjoy this series for years to come. This one is a classic for the 90s (But not like Cowboy Bebop, Evangelion, or Sailor Moon), and I think that almost everyone would enjoy this series for what it has to offer. \n        "},

That they are there for you (well Onizuka takes it to the extremes) and they are always there to back you up.\nThis is my short review on GTO hope this helps\n        "},
