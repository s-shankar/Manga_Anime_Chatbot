      description = "Jet, known on his home satellite as the \"Black Dog\" for his tenacity, is a 36-year-old former cop from Ganymede (a Jovian satellite) and acts as Spike's foil during the series. Physically, Jet is very tall with a muscular build. He wears a beard with no mustache, and is completely bald save for the back of his head. Spike acts lazy and uninterested, whereas Jet is hard working and a jack-of-all-trades. Jet was once an investigator in the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) for many years until he lost his arm in an investigation that went awry when his corrupt partner (and friend at the time) betrayed him. His arm was replaced with a cybernetic limb (later revealed to be by choice, as biological replacements were possible, he wanted the fake arm as a reminder of what happened), yet his loss of limb coupled with the general corruption of the police force prompted Jet to quit the ISSP in disgust and become a freelance bounty hunter. Jet also considers himself something of a renaissance man: he cultivates bonsai trees, cooks, enjoys jazz/blues music (he named his ship the Bebop, referring to a type of jazz), especially Charlie Parker, and even has interest in Goethe. As a character, Jet is the quintessential oyaji or \"dad\" even though he often wishes people would view him as a more brotherly figure (so as not to seem old). \
 Jet is skilled with handguns, typically carrying a pre-2004 Walther P99, as well as the use of the netgun. He is good with hand to hand combat as well. Unlike Spike, Jet tends to use more raw muscle than technique. He is also a great mechanic and pilot. Aside from the converted interplanetary fishing trawler vessel Bebop, Jet flies a smaller ship called Hammerhead. The Hammerhead appears to be a modified (Jet added larger engines and fuel tanks) salvage-craft that uses a mechanical arm equipped with a harpoon as its main weapon, which is somewhat analogous to his own mechanical arm. Both the Hammerhead and the Bebop are able to land on water, and have a fishing theme, most likely because Ganymede's surface is mostly covered with water (it is later revealed that the Bebop was originally a fishing ship that Jet \"customized\" with larger engines).\
 \
 During the series, it is revealed that Jet once lived with a woman named Alisa, who left him because he was too controlling. Later they meet up again when Alisa's new boyfriend Rhint is wanted for murder. Jet then ends up in a situation somewhat similar to that of Vicious, where he must hunt down a woman who broke his heart, and her lover.\
 \
 In a later episode, another Vicious/Spike parallel is set up when Jet finds out that it was his old partner Fad who betrayed him (though in Jet's case, there was no love affair involved). Fad arranged for Jet's death in a setup, but he survived with only a missing arm and a scar on his face. It is worth noting that Jet managed to face the demons of his past and let them go, in contrast to Spike, who was killed when he confronted his. This is likely due to the contrast in the two approaches to the past. While Spike hid and fled from his past, Jet tracked it down and confronted it.\

 Spike Spiegel is a tall and lean 27-year-old bounty hunter born on Mars. The inspiration for Spike is found in martial artist Bruce Lee who uses the martial arts style of Jeet Kune Do as depicted in Session 8, \"Waltz For Venus\". He has fluffy, dark green hair (which is inspired by Yusaku Matsuda's) and reddish brown eyes, one of which is artificial and lighter than the other. He is usually dressed in a blue leisure suit, with a yellow shirt and Lupin III inspired boots. A flashback in Session 6 revealed it was his fully functioning right eye which was surgically replaced by the cybernetic one (although Spike himself may not have conscious recollection of the procedure since he claims to have lost his natural eye in an \"accident\"). One theory is that his natural eye may have been lost during the pre-series massacre in which he supposedly \"died\". The purpose of this cybernetic eye is never explicitly stated, though it apparently gives him exceptional hand-eye coordination - particularly with firearms (Spike's gun of choice is a Jericho 941, as seen throughout the series). In the first episode, when facing a bounty-head using Red Eye, Spike mocks him, calling his moves \"too slow\". At first, this seems like posturing on Spike's part, but even with his senses and reflexes accelerated to superhuman levels by the drug, the bounty cannot even touch Spike. A recurring device throughout the entire show is a closeup on Spike's fully-natural left eye before dissolving to a flashback of his life as part of the syndicate. As said by Spike himself in the last episode, his right eye \"only sees the present\" and his left eye \"only sees the past.\" Spike often has a bent cigarette between his lips, sometimes despite rain or \"No Smoking\" signs.\

      description = "Faye Valentine Birthday: August 14, 1994\
 \
 One of the members of the bounty hunting crew in the anime series Cowboy Bebop. Often seen with a cigarette and in a revealing outfit complete with bright yellow hot pants and a matching, revealing top, black suspenders, white boots, and a long-sleeved red shirt worn normally through the sleeves, not to mention her signature headband, she is unusually attractive, sporting a bob of violet hair, green eyes, fair skin, and a voluptuous body. Although appearing to be no more than her 23 years alive suggests, Faye is actually upwards of 74-years-old, having been put into cryogenic freeze after a space shuttle accident. During the course of the series (set in 2071), Faye manages to cross paths with Spike and Jet twice before she finally makes herself at home aboard their ship the second time, much to the consternation and disapproval of the two men, both of whom have their own reservations about women in general. Faye herself is brash, egotistical, and quite lazy, despite taking plenty of time to pamper and care for her own appearance. Faye has also been placed under arrest several times in the series and spends much time in handcuffs on the ship. She, at times, expects the boys to take care of bounties for her, while she sits by idly to reap the benefits and eat all their food, another source of conflict.\
 \
 Seemingly little more than a thorn in her partners&rsquo; sides, Faye is actually a well-rounded member of the team. She can handle herself exceptionally well for a woman of her slight appearance, displaying at least once in the series (in \"Cowboy Funk\") that she packs quite a mean punch. Adept at flying, Faye has stood her ground just as well as Spike has in an aerial dogfight in her ship Red Tail, at times even against Spike in an aerial dogfight. She also excels with guns, and is first seen in the series completely disabling a ship with a Heckler & Koch MP5, though she is immediately apprehended afterward. In the movie, she is seen with the same gun, in addition to her normal companion: a Glock 30. Where Faye really shines, however, is with her mouth. She has an almost unstoppable attitude, and even her sometimes innocent smile can be seen as dangerous. Sarcastic and presumptuous, she rarely appears weak or in need of support. She brags and takes care of herself, never trusting others, cheating and lying her way from one day to the next.\
 \
  She is a woman who is skilled at getting what she wants; however, her indomitable exterior hides a more delicate interior. Upon awakening from her 54-year cryogenic sleep, not only was she saddled with a massive amount of debt that she had no means to pay, but she was also diagnosed with total amnesia, a stranger in a mysterious world that she was not a part of and did not understand, surrounded by people who claimed to be helping her but were only there to take advantage of her naivet&eacute;. The surname \"Valentine\" was merely a name given to her by the doctor who woke her; the circumstances of her accident, her previous life, and even her real name all remain a mystery, and are only gradually revealed as the series progresses. It has been hinted that she came from Singapore on Earth, and was the daughter of a very wealthy family, as the city's famous Merlion Statue features prominently in scenes of her childhood, and that memories and a film from her childhood showed her living in a large mansion. In an early episode, she states that she is descended from Roma people, but she may well have been lying. Utterly betrayed by someone she thought she could trust after waking, Faye found herself burdened with even more money to pay, and the situation resulted in the hardening of her personality to an extreme degree. She even says in Session 11: &ldquo;we deceive or we are deceived&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;nothing good ever happened to me when I trusted others.&rdquo; \
 Throughout the series, though she retains her sarcastic demeanor and unpleasant nature up until the very end, it is easy to see her grow as a character. She learns to value her comrades, coming back to the Bebop when she realizes that it is the only home that she has left, naming it as the &ldquo;only place I could return to&rdquo;. She grows to understand the disadvantages of being a loner, and that even though her \"family\" is somewhat dysfunctional it is still a place where she will always belong.\

 Ed could be considered a \"free spirit\"; she is fond of silly exclamations and childish rhymes, easily distracted, and the show's primary source of physical humor.\
 \
 Over the course of the show she rarely walks anywhere, preferring to run, crawl, flip, roll, walk on her hands, or even just saunter. Ed is always barefoot. In one episode, she considers putting on socks and shoes, but quickly removes them, as even wearing socks hampers her, and she falls over seconds after putting them on; she also appears to be exceptionally strong and flexible, being able to support her weight on her arms for several minutes at a time, and to scratch her nose with her toe.\

It is obvious that Ein is abnormally intelligent, as he is able to answer the telephone, drive a car (just the wheel), use the SSW, play shōgi, and generally do a number of other things that an average canine should not be able to do, but he never talks in a human language during the show. He does, however, speak in Session 18 \"Speak Like A Child\" after the credits Ein tells Spike \"Next Episode: Wild Horses\". He is able to \"speak\" to other species, as demonstrated in Session 17, \"Mushroom Samba\" (he spoke to a cow with a subtitled bark of \"Thanks\", to which the cow has a subtitled moo back of \"No problem\"). It is likely that Ed is the only crew member with any idea of Ein's capabilities, as the other crew members are quick to dismiss Ein, and never seem to acknowledge him as more than a pet. Ein initially takes a shine to Jet, but when Ed joins the crew, he comes around to her as well. Frequently the two trade roles, with Ein expressing very human sentiments via facial expression and Ed regressing to a feral state. He went with Ed after she left the crew, probably because of his attachment to her.

It takes its toll on the user though and over extended use causes delusions of grandeur. The drug is administered by a hypospray to the eye.

    People who know me know that I'm not a fan of episodic anime series unless they're either one season (12-14 episodes) long or a slice of life series. Why? They have a tendency to get boring, or repetitive. But all rules and preferences have exceptions. You know what? Cowboy Bebop is that exception.\
The story is set in a space western setting - a genre and setting I'm loving more and more for each show I watch that falls under the genre. We follow two bounty hunters, Spike and Jet, who own a ship called the Bebop. They travel the Solar system, chasing wanted criminals to\
          \
        earn money. Along the way, they also pick up two women; the debt-laden Faye Valentine and the playful kid and computer genius Edward (yes, Ed&rsquo;s a girl). \
Each episode brings about a new bounty which they chase after, and while that doesn't sound too exciting to watch 26 episodes in a row, you'll end up loving the show. All the different events makes for a certain degree of unpredictability, and you'll sometimes wonder how things will end. However, that alone is not enough to give the story the rating I've given it. So why have I given that rating? Let's continue...\
One of the things that elevate the show a bit above the rest is the manner in which the main cast's pasts are explored. It's not like one flashback episode and you understand everything about how they are today. In one episode you might get one piece, and then the next one in another episode, and it's not until the final three episodes of the show that everything falls in place. This way of executing it makes you want to watch another episode, so that you can find out more about the characters (some may say that this falls in under 'Character', but the manner in which the pasts are explored are more 'Story' than 'Character', IMO). Now, that's so far a 9 for the story. Why did it deserve a 10?\
The answer is easy: the way they executed many scenes in the show. The contrasts which you get to see between, music, the setting of scenes and what's really happening just gives the story that extra edge deserving of a perfect score.\
The characters are all really good and interesting fellows. Though they every now and then reminded me of characters from other shows, they preserved that originality which gave a feel that they were, if not completely, then at least a little bit more real than most characters out there. The way their pasts intertwine with the future and how everything ends with them confronting and settling open ends from their pasts is also something that's impressive to watch. I don't really have anything more to say than 'perfect'.\
The animation is, for a 90s anime, stunningly good. The detail put into backgrounds and surroundings is really good, and I also love how good lighting effects and shading are at times. All of Ed&rsquo;s strange movements are animated really nicely too. If there's something negative, it's the somewhat dull coloring (compared to today's standards), as well as poor effects when traveling in hyperspace.\
The soundtrack is also astounding! The music used for the show is so incredibly varied, and while keeping mostly to the more jazzy tunes, the soundtrack visits so many genres that it's hard to not like at least a few pieces. What I also loved is the way the music was used not only as a medium to go with and amplify the mood, but also as a contrast to what's happening in several scenes. All in all, it's really amazing. Don't have anything to say against voice acting and other sound effects either.\
All in all Cowboy Bebop is an anime that&rsquo;s in the top tier on the greatness scale, and a show I believe every anime fan should give a try.\

    Cowboy Bebop is one of those series that is just impossible to criticize. Not because it has no flaws, but because it has rabid fans who will defend it to the death. It has obtained the mythical “classic armor,” which is an abhorrent carte blanche, bestowed upon only the most overrated of anime, that is used to automatically defend against any sort of legitimate criticism. Cowboy Bebop certainly has good qualities, and it is relevant in how it influenced western perception of anime, but it wasn't quite groundbreaking or revolutionary in and of itself. You could argue that its audiovisuals were in fact groundbreaking, but\
          \
        I think a work needs more than superficial qualities to be truly revolutionary or great.\
\
Cowboy bebop borrows much from western media and pop culture in general. his show pays homage to or references, subtly and overtly, things as disparate as Antonio Banderas, Bruce Lee, John Woo, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Convoy, Biggie Smalls, Donald Duck, various mythologies and folktales, The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, Bill Evans, Stray Cats, Alien, blaxploitation films, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Queen, George Clooney, Led Zeppelin, Django and other spaghetti westerns, Herbie Hancock, American and Japanese professional baseball, Yellow Magic Orchestra, Jean-Luc Godard, Batman,  B.B. King, Beverly Hills 90210, John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, The Unabomber, Heaven's Gate and Marshall Applewhite, Kiss, film noir, The Beatles, Sleeping Beauty, Bonny & Clyde, Ziggy Stardust, Charlie Parker, Woody Allen, Star Trek, Cool Hand Luke, and Taxi Driver. I kid you not. And that's not a complete list. References in character design and dialogue are forgivable, but when it straight up copies scenes and plots then I think it can be held against the show. I feel like I've seen Cowboy Bebop before, it's just been packed into a pretty package. I enjoyed a lot of these homages, but that does not excuse the marked lack of creativity. The mere evocation of a masterpiece does not make a masterpiece. Quentin Tarantino is an example of someone who uses pastiche and cultural references well, and most importantly, his references and homages don't make up his entire videography. There is far too little originality in Cowboy Bebop. \
\
The fact is that Cowboy Bebop is the epitome of style over substance. I can appreciate it for its audiovisuals, but, to me, a show needs more than that to be a true masterpiece. Make no mistake though, it does have some of the best audiovisuals I've ever seen, and could arguably be considered a must-watch for that alone. The OST is good (despite also being a tad overrated,) the art is great, and the animation is extremely fluid. It should also be noted that Cowboy Bebop is one of the few anime that holds the distinction of having an English dub superior to the original Japanese. The atmosphere that the audiovisuals achieve is their greatest quality, and is distinct in almost every different setting. This is not done well in most space travel anime, and I have to applaud Cowboy Bebop for that achievement at least. \
\
The main storyline consists of about 5 episodes, the rest of them being episodic individual stories. This wouldn't be a huge problem, but the episodic stories were hit or miss, and they never measured up to the main plot. Some of the non-main episodes focus on a character and their past, and this is good, but most of them are completely pointless and could be removed without anybody noticing. One of them was about fighting an alien-fungus-fridge-monster, it was an interesting and silly parody of Alien, but it contributed nothing to plot or character development. Considering how character driven this show is, that's a problem. There was also an entire episode paying homage to blaxploitation. Seeing as the allusion was presented in a more original way, and the episode showed a lot about Ed's character, that one was not only forgivable, but it was one of my favorite episodes. Like I said, hit or miss. There is an episode about catching a super-dog. There is an episode about a virus that turns people into monkeys. There is an episode where they chase a bomber (Woody Allen) with some help from a transsexual looking trucker. At least 4 episodes were easily 10s, but more of them were closer to 5s. The first 4 episodes were particularly weak, which is a huge problem in a 2 cour anime. The anime may have had a good conclusion, but the sub-par exposition cannot be ignored. \
\
The main crew was made up of interesting and entertaining characters, and they prevented the episodic nature of the show from being a complete flop, although there were some unanswered questions about Faye's past in particular. Actually, strangely enough, the unanswered questions contributed to the splendid atmosphere. Everything had a rich backstory, but few flashbacks and no infodumps. This helped give the show its characteristic nostalgic atmosphere. One complaint I would have is that the main antagonist is simply not compelling, his motivations are somewhat unclear, and he's just one dimensional. He also uses a katana, even though it’s the future, and somehow still manages to kick ass. He’s just very cliché and lame. The antagonist in the movie was very well done with his depth, motives, and parallels to Spike, and that makes me wish Vicious got the same treatment, as it would fit his character far better, and his character is far more important. \
\
One thing you should understand is that the characters are often good examples of clichés done well. Jet, for instance, is the typical hard-boiled former cop, but he is also the most empathetic of the crew. He is a foil to Spike and is hard working, but they also parallel in many ways. Ed is the teen genius/tomboy and hacker with little depth, but she also serves as a foil to Spike and many of his views on life. Faye is like a mix of all of the other characters' worst traits in terms of personality, but she still manages to be a sympathetic character. In fact, even though she keeps up her unpleasant exterior and despite her being the anime's main source of fanservice, she arguably experiences more development than any other character. Still, they lack any sort of real innovation, in anime or otherwise.\
\
Despite all my criticisms, Cowboy Bebop is cool. It's very cool. The characters and aesthetics were compelling (for the most part) to the point where I even enjoyed some of the admittedly weaker episodes. I can't give it a 10, it's simply not a masterpiece. I can't give it a 9, it's not truly great. I can't give it an 8, it's too flawed and unoriginal. I don’t want to give it a 7, it was just too inconsistent. I have to settle on a 6.7 or so, which could be rounded either way. That said, an average of my story, art, sound, and character scores did give me around a 7.2. \
\
Cowboy Bebop is enjoyable and it has wide appeal; I would probably recommend it to just about anybody. It was up and down in terms of quality, and it was similar to a slice-of-life in its episodic and relaxed nature and its lack of an explosive climax, but it was good. I liked how the anime takes place after the \"important part\" of the main characters' lives is over, and nostalgia becomes a huge theme, seeing as it was the first anime I ever watched and it thus evokes a huge sense of nostalgia for me anyway. I loved the laid back atmosphere. The problem is that after looking through all of the episodes and rating them individually, I realized that the majority of it was nothing special. With a little restraint and reworking, Cowboy Bebop could have been the masterpiece that it is widely regarded as, and it does hold a special place in my heart regardless, even if that is only due to it being my first anime. That bias is probably why I choose to round the score to 7, rather than to 6, despite the fact that the latter is typically the better practice. \
\
I am always willing to defend and justify my scores so leave me a comment if you disagree, and tell me why I’m wrong. I say that because this does seem to be a pretty uncommon score, even among those whose opinions I have great respect for. Keep in mind that a 7 is a generous and good score in any case. ",

    Only a few anime series or movies could be considered true classics, and one of the most notable shows to fall into this category is iconic not just for its style, design and animation, but also for the depth of its characters and its music.\
That anime is Cowboy Bebop.\
Story\
Cowboy Bebop is told as a series of standalone episodes, each of which is only really connected to one another by the characters, with very few of them directly following on from one another. This method of storytelling is now termed as &ldquo;episodic&rdquo;, and while the format is now commonplace in anime, this series set the standard\
          \
        in its usage, and many purists believe it to be almost flawless in its execution of this storytelling style. \
Sunrise, the production company behind the show, used this format as a tool to develop the characters in the show, and whilst many episodes are unique in terms of story content and plot, there is a strong connection to the rest of the series due to the strength of the characters, something which also applies to the movie Knocking on Heaven&rsquo;s Door.\
One of the big advantages to the show's storytelling method is that it allows the viewer to jump straight into the story at almost any point, however it should be noted that many shows that adopt the episodic format are often let down by poor character development. The fact that the series manages to develop its characters, and develop them well, is a testament to the strength of the individual episodes as standalone stories, and the personal history of each character (which becomes clearer as the series progresses). In essence, Cowboy Bebop is a more about the characters themselves and their relationships with each other, than it is about their &ldquo;adventures&rdquo;. There are a number of episodes where the viewer may feel a strong connection to the characters, their history,mannerisms, pet peeves, etc, something which is difficult enough to accomplish in a normal sequential story. Achieving this in an episodic story is a mark of the quality of the series.\
\
Art/Animation\
The animation in Cowboy Bebop is amongst the best seen in anime, and even though it is now over a decade old, it still manages to hold its own in terms of animation and character design with more modern action oriented shows. Sunrise, who generally do an excellent job on animation, really pushed the boat out with this series, and when compared with other shows that were released around the same time (Outlaw Star for example), it can clearly be seen that the art, animation and character design in Cowboy Bebop is something special. The animation during the numerous action sequences is especially impressive and the character movements are free-flowing and naturalistic.\
The art, while not vibrant with flashy colours, portrays the feeling, attitude and environmental influences for the characters perfectly. The numerous locales which the crew of the Bebop visit are rendered in stunning detail, adding a surreal sense of realism to the show, whilst the character designs were a work of brilliance, and allows each character a mark of individuality even before they spoke.\
Sound\
The quality of the soundwork used in Cowboy Bebop is what really sets it apart from other anime series. The music was composed by the world renowned Yoko Kanno, and performed by The Seatbelts, a band specifically formed by Kanno to perform the music for the series. The music is a strange mix of blues, classic rock and jazz, and while at first this may seem an odd choice for a sci-fi series, the music works extremely well in the setting as it reflects the generally lackadaisical attitude adopted by the crew of the Bebop. Even today, the soundtrack for this anime is unique in terms of style and composition. The opening theme, Tank!, has become one of the most influential pieces in anime history, and one of the few anime based music tracks to be appreciated by music lovers with no background in anime or manga.\
The sound effects in the series are also well done. The various locations are vibrant with background noises, from the hum of the Bebop's engines and the sound of gulls by the sea, to the hubbub of a crowded street. The many gunshots and explosions are clear and sound almost as though you're standing right in the middle of the wild gun battles. \
Whilst the Japanese voice actors do an excellent job with each of the four main characters, this is one of the rare anime shows out there where many prefer the English cast over the original Japanese. Cowboy Bebop is one of the few anime in existence where the English dub is equal to, if not better than, the original Japanese version.\
Characters\
Cowboy Bebop has some of the most original and memorable characters to appear in anime. Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed are four of the most enigmatic individuals to found in the medium, and upon seeing them, the viewer will probably wonder how they work together when all of them come from diversely different backgrounds with opinions that clash with one another. \
Spike and Jet are most definitely 'The Odd Couple' of sci-fi anime, or indeed any genre of anime you care to name. Their conflicting personalities bounce off each other like peas on a drum, and once Faye is added to the mix it becomes a potent brew of character interaction. It is through this interaction that the viewer is more able to empathise with each character, and the slow but steady revelations about their pasts, told wonderfully through flashbacks and reunions, have far greater impact because of this empathy. The characters are so well defined that many scenes which would normally appear mundane in other anime are just as memorable in this series as the action scenes (one springs to mind - Spike and Jet eating eggs after Faye, Ed and Ein leave the ship).\
Enjoyment \
Cowboy Bebop is a sci-fi western with equal parts humour and seriousness, and is already considered by many within the anime community to be a classic. There is a level of sophistication in both the story and its characters that is rare for a show, regardless of whether it is an anime or not. The great cast, the heavy drama tempered with bouts of comedy, the excellent music, all serve to cement its place in the hearts and minds of anime fans the world over. It is a testament to its quality that there is only one show, anime or otherwise, that can be held up as a fair comparison (Joss Whedon&rsquo;s Firefly). This is considered by many to be a &ldquo;must-see&rdquo; series as it is a testament to what can be achieved in anime with the right ingredients. \
The only downside to this anime would be the lack of a continuous story. Because of this, the series lacks the 'epic saga' feel upon which many sci-fi stories are judged. However, the depth of each character, together with the strength of their individual stories, is more than enough to carry this series.\

    Cowboy Bebop was one of the first anime that truly impressed me. \
One of the first anime that convinced me the anime genre as a whole had something going for it, that anime has qualities that separate it from other forms of entertainment.\
It is a show that has withstood the test of time and is often viewed as a masterpiece by many. With such popularity and praise there is bound to be a group of the opposite extreme that dislike the show. Now I bear in my mind that although this group is a minority their points are valid. As a reviewer I look at\
          \
        all angles and try my best to keep bias at an all time low.\
Having said that, regardless of my attempts to locate the flaws of this show my overall consensus is that Cowboy Bebop is in multiple ways a masterpiece.\
Here Goes The Review (Spoilers are at a Minimum)\
Story~9.5\
When most people think about what society would be like by the time space exploration is achieved they imagine a society that is more organized, coherent, and advanced. This is one of the key misconceptions that cause Cowboy Bebop’s story to shine.\
We start our episodic space journey in an environment that is futuristic yet in many ways primitive. Watanabe Shinichiro’s depiction of the Cowboy Bebop universe seamlessly fuses the attitudes and tensions of a western shooter with the atmosphere of vast unexplored space. Due to the inability of the police to handle all criminals in such a large area bounty hunting is encouraged through media. Our four main characters (discussed more in the character section) just so happen to be bounty hunters that are all unwillingly bound together by greed, revenge, coincidence, and or desire. Furthermore, little to no background information is given about any of the characters from the beginning. Each character has a past that is hinted throughout many episodes. Slowly, the audience learns of the sins, misfortunes, and tragedies that quietly haunt those aboard the spaceship of Bebop.\
And so this is the world us, the viewers, are thrust into and what an amazingly unique barren world it is. Being for the most part episodic, viewers may be deterred by the looseness and seemingly pointlessness of certain episodes. Be aware that although episodic, each episode develops the characters and is key to forming the bonds that will ultimately culminate the multiple climaxes of the story.\
Art~9.5\
Do not let age fool you. Despite being over a decade and a half old the animations in Cowboy Bebop are amazing in providing the dangerous rugged environment of criminal filled space. In fact, the 1998 art is more of a positive than a negative. Gone are the crisp saturated art of modern day. The outdated animations contribute greatly to the classy western style of the anime. Everything from the smoke of cigarettes to guns ablazing are portrayed brilliantly. The choreography of martial arts and space flight is done in a fluid and smooth fashion. The characters look great and production never seems to dip for a single moment.\
Three simple words can summarize the art: Rugged yet Classy~\
And so in trying my absolute best to pinpoint the flaws of the art I am both reluctant and glad to announce that I have failed in doing so. Cowboy Bebop’s art is amazingly well done even for today’s standards. Knowing in the back of your head that this art originates from 1998 is just icing on the cake.\
Sound~10\
Earlier in my review I talked about how with much praise and popularity ultimately spawns a group with ideals of the opposite extreme. I wholeheartedly believe that it is safe to say that regardless of your ideas about Cowboy Bebop, everyone can agree that the music in this anime is absolutely amazing. So amazing that without the music I believe that Cowboy Bebop would never have achieved the success it has had to this day.\
Never have I come across another example such as Cowboy Bebop where the music is such an integral part of the show.\
From the Blues riffs of slide guitars to the unmatched soul of harmonica solos, the music in Cowboy Bebop does its job 110%. To say that the the music is fitting would be an understatement. Cowboy Bebop’s music boosts the atmosphere and situation of every scene to its highest potential and provides a convincing atmosphere like no other.\
The dub of Cowboy Bebop is the arguably the most highly praised dub ever produced in the anime industry. Watanabe Shinichiro himself has even stated that he believed the English dub surpasses the Japanese dub, a feat that is notoriously rare. Every character’s voice is portrayed brilliantly with every word filled with real human emotion. Convincingly raw and powerful, I have yet to stumble across another instance where the voice acting was this well done. I honestly can not think up a single flaw of the voice acting even while keeping bias at a minimum. The English voice acting is truly a one of a kind in a world of horribly ear wrenching dubs.\
The OP and the ED of Cowboy Bebop are probably one of the most popular Opening and Ending Themes of all time. The OP (\"Tank!\" by The Seatbelts) is a jazzy explosion of adrenaline. Listening to it is a joy and pumps the viewer’s eagerness to watch the episode. It keeps you on your feet and is in many ways the most famous trademark of the Cowboy Bebop series. The ED for most of the show (\"The Real Folk Blues\" by The Seatbelts feat. Mai Yamane) is equally as amazing but instead of pumping the viewer’s eagerness the ED in turn helps the viewer digest what was just displayed on the screen. Listening to the ED causes heartwarming scenes to be that much more heartwarming while heartbreaking scenes to be that much more heartbreaking. The Real Folk Blues is a beautiful jazzy blues inspired song sung over with Mai Yamane’s powerful voice. The ED only changes twice in the anime, each change being only for one episode. As a reviewer I would not feel right about spoiling the timing of the ED changes because they are in my opinion some of the most powerful moments of the anime. And so this last bit I shall let the viewer experience.\
Character~10\
Cowboy Bebop has one of the most memorable casts of any show I have ever watched. They are eccentric, unique, strong willed, and powerfully convincing.\
We have Spike Spiegel who is a male bounty hunter in his late twenties that is trying to escape an inescapable past; Jet Black, the father like figure of the spaceship Bebop who has been stricken by unjust tragedies; Faye Valentine, the strong independent con artist who is kept in the dark about her own life; and last but not least Edward, the androgynous female teenage hacker with a background as confusing as herself. \
As mentioned earlier they are for the most part unwillingly bound together by greed, revenge, coincidence, and or desire. This is what is so great about the characters in Cowboy Bebop… they all start off the show hating each other!\
The reluctant and slow change of their relationships is humorous,real, and convincing.\
The climatic points of the show are the episodes in which bits and pieces of each crew member’s past is slowly revealed. We get to see and feel what they were hiding and the raw emotions that they feel. Each character is its own little mystery that keeps the audience in the dark. \
Easily the most impressive aspect of Cowboy Bebop is the portrayal of the characters. The crew deals with grief, anger, sadness, and all else in their own unique ways and rarely deviate. How Shinichiro portrays this uniqueness is simply amazing. The characters NEVER falter and always stay true to themselves. As the episodes roll by, the audience starts to understand why each character acts the way they do and can relate. This understanding makes it unbearably easy for the audience to become emotionally attached to each crew member as we share their pain and memories.\
All in all, the characters of Cowboy Bebop are outstanding. Their strengths overcome their flaws when united as a whole. Beautifully drawn and creative, Shinichiro has invented a golden cast.\

Even after watching dozens of anime after Cowboy Bebop it still strongly remains one of my few masterpieces. \

    Cowboy Bebop was originally an anime series created by Shinichiro Watanabe in 1998. It consists of 26 episodes, a mini-sode, and a theatrical movie. It was released in America in 2001, and is one of the few anime franchises to be more successful in North America than in its native Japan. I have seen the 26 tv episodes and the movie. I already know what a lot of you are doing right now after glancing at the numerical score I gave; you're hitting up the comment box on my profile and writing these exact words:\
\"Fuck you! Cowboy Bebop is a classic! You're not allowed to\
          \
        criticize it!\"\
The more astute viewers will note that I scored the series a 6, but the movie a 9. I kind of like Cowboy Bebop. It does do some things very right. It had the potential to be one of the greatest franchises ever. Alas, while its production values are unmatched, the writing . . . doesn't always match up with the production. Because of this, the series ended up being a style-over-substance experience for me, but why was that?\
The premise of CB is that in the late 21st century, mankind has started living in places in the solar system besides Earth. In this future are bounty hunters known as Cowboys. Cowboys do whatever they can to make cash to keep the food stockpile stocked and their spaceships running. The show follows one such group of Cowboys who pilot a ship called the Bebop. In the beginning, we meet Spike Spiegel, a former gangster, and Jet Black, a former cop. As the series progresses, the Bebop also has Ein, a super smart dog, Faye Valentine, a woman on the run, and Edward, a really, really, REALLY weird hacker girl. Cowboy Bebop has been described as a series that has a continuous plot, and has standalone episodes at the same time. Having seen the series, I can tell you that technically, most of the episodes aren't standalone, but many of them are only connected by the core characters.\
Here's where one of my problems lie. When Cowboy Bebop is good, it's really good. The setting is very mature; it never condescends to the audience. The action scenes are superbly well done, the dialog is believable (though cheesy at times), and the atmosphere really pulls you in. How many episodes are actually really good? Seven. If you count the movie as an episode, that brings it up to eight. Eight out of twenty-seven episodes were good. The rest were not.\
The problem with most of the episodes is one of two things: one, it's really boring, or, two, it's so clichéd, you will be able to predict exactly what happens by the end after the first two minutes, or both. I have to be honest, a lot of the episodes of CB are just plain boring. If this wasn't a \"classic\" and a more ordinary anime series, a lot of them would be branded as what they truly are; filler episodes. And if it's not boring filler, it's hackneyed.\
Watanabe is known for being a huge fan of American cinema, and that's obvious in CB. Unfortunately, he ripped off a lot of American movies virtually piecemeal. Now, you may not suspect it, but I am more knowledgeable of American cinema than I am Japanese animation. To describe it as best I can without spoiling, if you have seen at least one movie directed by Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez, John Woo, and Michael Mann, then you have already seen Cowboy Bebop in another format. This is actually a clever trick though; most anime fans reject Western pop culture, and may not notice this when watching CB, so they'll think it's \"fresh\" and \"original\", when it's fact, it's actually MORE clichéd then most anime. But hey, when CB is exciting and isn't (too) blatantly ripping off Hollywood, it's worth watching.\
At least, when the worthwhile characters are onscreen. I like the main character Spike a lot. He is the embodiment of cool, like a 21st century version of Steve McQueen. He's cool, but he's very human too. He's reckless, he makes mistakes, but he knows how to charm people, and he also knows how to beat his targets. I also like Jet. He's a constant worrywart, which is a funny contrast to his rough appearance. Some of the incidental characters are memorable too, (but usually only in the good episodes and movie). Something else I liked was the Bebop crew was not always a stable group, or nakama you could say. In most anime, when the heroes band together, nothing ever separates them. That doesn't happen in CB. Sometimes, the crew gets in arguments, and sometimes, one of them will leave the Bebop for a time, and so on. It's a touch of realism I appreciate.\
However, some of the characters didn't click with me. I never really cared for Faye. I don't dislike her, but I don't really care for her either. Edward is amusing, but she feels out of place in a series like this. The incidental characters in the less memorable episodes are just that, unmemorable. However, what I'm about to print in the next paragraph will anger thousands, possibly millions. (And maybe make hundreds say \"Right on!\") Mind you, it's just my opinion. Everything I print in these reviews is just my opinion; you don't have to take it personally, but the following opinion of mine needs to be said:\
Vicious is one of the lamest villains ever.\
The main antagonist is a man known as Vicious, someone who's still a part of the gang Spike came from. He's cunning, ruthless . . . and is absolutely lame. What's his motive? Does he just want power, or to mess with people? Even if so, why is he so boring to watch? The villain from the movie was a lot more interesting. Overall, you got two really good protagonists, some interesting chemistry between the protagonists, one-shot characters who are either interesting or not, and a forgettable antagonist. Yay.\
And I haven't even touched upon the ending yet! Short version, I don't like CB's ending. (More flames incoming! Duck and cover!) Now, the ending is not quite as bad as the ending for, say, Akira, or the anime version of Chobits. It does have a sense of finality to it, something most anime endings don't have. However, I did not find it \"legendary.\" I found it disappointing. First of all, the ending is extremely predictable. It's virtually telegraphed to you before it even happens. Not only that, when I saw it, my reaction was, \" . . . that's it? Seriously, that's IT?\"\
But I better move on to CB's technical aspects before I get too letdown. Its artistry leaves no complaints. CB is probably the best-looking pre-digital anime I've ever seen. Even if you were to remake the series with digital enhancements, I doubt you could make it look better than it already is. Sumptuous backgrounds, top-notch character art, animation that ranges from above-average to really good, no off-model shots, this is a visual feast. The movie looks even better. It's obvious a lot of care was put into the visuals of CB. My only being the primitive CGI, but you get used to it.\
And now we touch upon CB's greatest aspect; its soundtrack. It's the sort of the soundtrack that makes you go, \"Ah yeah, baby!\" This is why you watch CB, the music. The music is the magnum opus of Yoko Kanno. A combination of jazz, blues, and rock, but it isn't just any old jazz, blues, and rock, it's GOOD jazz, blues, and rock. Everything from the opening, to the incidental music, to the endings, you get music that will set your soul on fire. The only anime I've seen whose soundtrack could rival CB's is Death Note's. Something I noticed about CB's soundtrack is the music sounds more like music from albums rather than typical soundtrack music. Another smart move; most people are accustomed to listening to music from CD and MP3 albums as opposed to soundtracks, so when they hear CB's music, it'll be more familiar-sounding than most other anime soundtracks. Regardless, even if you hate CB, you gotta score this music.\
CB is also famous for having what is perhaps the oldest English dub for an anime series that is considered god-like. I saw this on Adult Swim, and I can safely say, this is another masterpiece from Bandai and Bang Zoom. Every character sounds like how you would imagine them to, and the voices are neither wooden nor over-acted. All the different accents the characters have sound really cool too. I did sample the Japanese dub on the movie, and I will say, Spike and Jet sound really good in both Japanese and English, but I will never get used to Faye's Japanese voice. Yeah, this is one you gotta see in English. (Though in retrospect, the Japanese performances aren't bad, it just doesn't click like the English dub)\
While CB is still often regarded as a classic, I'm not the first to criticize it like so. There has been some backlash against CB in recent years. Some people complain it's not \"Japanese-y\" enough, that it's too Western. I mentioned that earlier, but there is another anime I've seen, Baccano, which is also very similar to American movies, but it was consistently entertaining, and not as predictable as CB, so I did not mind. Others have mentioned the same things I have, that it's boring, the plot isn't strong enough, it's style over substance. This isn't a disaster by any means, but I do have to say that, outside of the production values, CB is one of the most overrated anime I've seen. It's not one of the worst, certainly not, but it's not quite the experience I was promised either. To put it in other words, there were some episodes that I would score a 4 out of 10. And yet, there are some episodes, including the movie, that I would score a 9 out of 10. The 6 overall is just from mixing the good episodes with the bad.\
I like to imagine that in an alternate dimension, CB was an OVA series instead of a tv series. All the episodes I do like, (# 2, 8, 12, 13, 17, 20, and 22) were released on separate OVAs, as well as a few others to bridge the plot gaps. Then a theatrical came out (Knocking on Heaven's Door), and then another to end it all (The Real Folk Blues, albeit with a revised conclusion), and it would be grandiose. Alas, I don't live in that universe. Hey, Shinichiro Watanabe likes drawing influence from Hollywood, right? What's something it's doing a lot of right now? Continuity reboots? He could still do that. I can dream, can't I?\

    Cowboy Bebop is an episodic series. By episodic, I mean that one episode doesn't necessarily lead or follow the next one. With that being said, don't expect a lot of \"plot\" in this series. You watch Cowboy Bebop for the characters, plain and simple. Spike, Faye, Jet, Ed, Ein are what make this anime arguably one of the most memorable series ever produced. The music is awesome (especially if you're a fan of Jazz), the animation is top notch (considering when the series came out), and the enjoyment value is second to none.\
While a lot of people want that \"similar episode\" feel, if you're the\
          \
        kind of person that enjoys a fast paced anime (with each character getting his or her own spotlight), this is for you. If you're not the type to enjoy fast paced, bounty huntin' fun, and rather you like deep thought provoking, dark, mysterious shows...don't watch Cowboy Bebop. Vicious (one of the characters) may be able to bring a little of that sinister side for you, but this isn't that kind of show.\

    The most overhyped and overrated anime of all time in my opinion. The first 20 or so episodes are pretty much random bounty hunting episodes then near the end of the series they try to throw in some ridiculous plot involving a 'Syndicate'. The animation and art was subpar, the sound and music were very nice though. Overall Cowboy Bebop is disappointing and very much a forgettable series. If you want to see a good series from Cowboy Bebop's director Shinichiro Watanabe check out Samurai Champloo \

    Cowboy Bebop has something that the anime world has seem to have forgotten in a coinpurse somewhere: balls.\
I don't mean just any kind of balls. I mean huge, sweaty, hairy testicles that swing back and forth like wrecking balls at the sheer hint of thigh movement. The atom-slicing power of these balls could level Detroit in a single blow. I'm not talking about the steroid ravaged, \"mom where's the protein\" balls of TTGL or G Gundam either. Those are anime you put on right after you inject yourself with bull-shark testosterone and deadlift 440 lbs. No, the balls Cowboy Bebop slaps on the table are\
          \
        of a different caliber; a different breed entirely, than the balls other anime, good and bad, have displayed in the past. They exude confidence without devolving into double-down, Long Island guido douchebaggery---they stand ice-cold in their manliness but aren't afraid to deliver one powerful scene after another. They aren't concerned with pretentious, Freudian mindfuckery, and they're past the \"edginess\" of gore, tits, and embarrassing profanity. There's no shitty gimmicks or pandering, and they don't let themselves fall victim to the stereotypes of what anime is supposed to be. Like Goku and Vegeta, or white people in Baltimore, they are the last of a dying breed.\
Cowboy Bebop is an anime in the most basic sense of the word. In reality, it's a 26 episode, moving piece of artwork, taking influence from cultures in vastly different parts and time periods of the world. It's film noir, Chinatown style. It's The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, with Clint Eastwood's patented ice-cold asswhippery and Sergio Leone's masterful spaghetti western storytelling. It's 1930s New Orleans, Louisiana. It's Star Wars. It's Enter the Dragon. It's a culmination of the spiciest cultural influences from the far east to the shores of the west, and it's honestly the best experience with an anime you will ever have. Some people have a bone to pick with the episodic nature of the plot, but pay no mind to them. Each new episode is like a blank slate, individually developed and shaped into a unique piece; a miniature story that calls upon a fresh set of inspirations to give it a flavor all its own. The overarching plot of the show is subtle but existent; it draws upon all sorts of themes and motifs like love and revenge, and is quietly woven throughout the series until it finally takes precedence at the end. Despite this, the transition from standalone episodes to the overall story feels natural. Some shows force plot elements onto you like an American businessman on a young Filipino girl (ever see the second arc of Death Note?), but the progression here is cool Lester smooth. You can choose to take in the show however you want to---you can relish in the individual beauty of each episode or you can view the show as one coherent story, continually building off of itself. Either way, you end up with something that's completely genuine and one of a kind---there's no other anime like it.\
While Cowboy Bebop isn't really associated with VIP quality artwork like it is with VIP quality soundtracks, Bebop has literally some of the best artwork in anime, ever. For some reason when you bring up the artwork from any pre-2000s anime, people get all condescending, like anything released before 2001 was drawn completely in purple crayon by Ms. Johnson's 8:30 AM kindergarten class. I've lost count of how many times I've heard stunning 90s animation cut down as \"dated\" by people that praise the emotionless, passionless digital animation of today. If anyone ever tells you Bebop's art is anything less than outstanding, punch them in the uterus for me. The animation is spectacular---the movement is surprisingly natural and the action is fluid. Watch a few of the fight scenes and you'll see why the creative staff of Naruto were reduced to ripping off one from the Cowboy Bebop movie, frame for frame. A lot of the character designs did away with traditional anime characteristics: bodies are proportional, even going so far as to downsize their usually massive eyes to a smaller, more manageable scale. The designs themselves are a treat to look at, and they fit the personalities of the characters pretty solidly. The action scenes themselves are varied, ranging the gauntlets from fistfights to dogfights and everything in between. If you don't think watching losers getting their shit wrecked is awesome, you will by the end of this show. Fuck, even the CG is good, if a little rough. The amount of detail Sunrise put into the animation is just, totally astonishing---even with the technological advancements of today it still takes a dump all over most of the artwork that's been put out in the past decade or so.\
Now, again, Cowboy Bebop is associated primarily with its soundtrack. There's a particularly good reason for this, and it's because it's literally the best soundtrack you'll ever hear. While most anime, especially today, resort to typical gutter trash j-pop, the music of Bebop is an ensemble of jazz, blues, classical, funk, rock, with a little pop and even a little heavy metal. You get a nice introduction to what's in store from the OP---Tank is a kick in the ass and its only amplified by what's probably the best opening in all of anime. After an entire episode of fucking outrageous tracks, you close with The Real Folk Blues which is beautiful and totally melancholy. You will want to own every OST by the end of the show; other shows might have good music but I don't think I've ever seen a show with a soundtrack that's just as good if listened to like a regular old album. From Space Lion to Ask DNA, Yoko Kanno constantly hits it out of the park, and without her Bebop wouldn't have that signature vibe it's so well known for.\
Also, the English dub is the best dub ever made. Period. If you watch this subbed you might as well kick yourself in the balls and set your computer on fire because you're depriving yourself of what is some of the best voice acting anime has ever seen. As much as I respect the Japanese voice actors and don't want to minimize their work, I don't even know what the hell they sound like because the dub is that fucking good. Trust me, even if you spit on dubs like they're a woman on the Maury show or a degree from ITT Tech, you need to give this one a chance. There is no weak link among the voice actors; every voice fits its character perfectly---every performance is Oscar worthy in its own right. It's honestly god-tier.\
As for the characters, well, without them the show is nothing. Literally, the characters make this show. If you swapped them out for any other cast, the result would be a vastly inferior series about a group of douchebags on a gay spaceship who hang around shitholes and fuck with losers all day. Instead, what we're given is probably one of the most dramatic and artistic character pieces ever put to film. Each character feels like a living, breathing person, with their own faults and imperfections and checkered pasts. They don't just feel like plot devices for carrying a story along. The way they interact with each other and grow as people throughout all their exploits feels authentic and real, and their development over time is part of what makes Bebop so classic. Like real people, they constantly fight and bicker amongst one another but it's that bickering, and the experiences they have together, that draws them closer as a group. It's this approach to characterization that really pulls Bebop together as a whole---each character has their own story to tell and slowly, as you work your way through the series, you find out what those stories are. You have Spike, the smoothest, most ice cold motherfucker this side of the Milky Way, who brings a little humanity to the \"live life in the fast lane and kick a shit ton of asses while you do it\" lifestyle that he leads alongside his life partner Jet, who despite his ruggedness really serves as kind of a father figure to the group. Faye's past envelops her otherwise forward and strong personality, and Edward is just straight up goofy, but in an endearing way that actually makes you smile. Their trials and tribulations amongst each other and others from both their past and their present are entertaining, engrossing, and touching---again, without them, the show wouldn't be nearly what it is today.\
I think the sheer quality and accessibility of this anime gives a lot of people the wrong idea, because I constantly see people recommending this as a great \"first anime\" for trying to get people into the medium. Cowboy Bebop was one of the first anime I saw, but I think using it as an introduction sends people the wrong message about what they should expect from most of the anime they'll see. Cowboy Bebop is a pinnacle in visual entertainment precisely because it's able to shed the typical \"skin\" of an anime and develop into something much deeper and more culturally rich. There's a lot of great anime out there, and the more anime I watch the more of it I discover. But starting with something so dissimilar to the majority of what anime is will give people a skewed perception of what anime should be right from the start. I guess this is the only way to get some people to sit down and actually watch a cartoon, but for others you're setting them up for disappointment down the road.\
Enjoyment? It's the best anime I've ever seen. That's the only way I can describe how I feel about it. It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry (keyword you, I don't have tear ducts so I can't cry. Tragic accident, I don't want to talk about it). It'll make you think, it'll make you feel. It might give you a boner. It's untouchable. It's ice cold. It's a classic.\
It's the best anime I've ever seen.\

    So, I know almost everyone loves this show to death, but honestly I in no way can understand the hype. Cowboy Bebop is, probably, the worst anime I have ever seen in my life.\
Story - 1\
First of all, there is no story. The show is episodic, which isn't always a bad thing, but Cowboy Bebop does each individual episode's story so poorly. Every episode basically goes the same way. The crew catches a cheap bounty showing how \"cool\" they are. Then, one of the members meets some suspicious stranger, who, surprise, ends up having a bounty on their head. As the episode moves on, we\
          \
        learn that the criminal isn't actually a bad person, and that they've just been put in a rough situation. A final confrontation takes place, and the criminal dies at the end. Every now and then there are special character episodes, which change up the formula a little bit, but then the consequences to these stories never show up again. \
Art - 6\
Art was really bland. The colors are boring. Animation was smooth. But then again it's easy to make animation smooth when almost nothing happens.\
Sound - No Score\
I don't listen to music because I spend all my time watching anime, so the whole music aspect of the show was lost on me. \
Character - 3\
The characters are so boring and simple. Spike is the typical \"cool\" character because he never has to put any effort into what he's doing. His backstory, which is seemingly one of the big pulls of the show, is so cliche that it becomes boring and a waste of time. I would criticize Jet's character but I really don't know enough about him because he's never developed, except for one random character episode that is supposed to make us feel sorry for him or something. Faye is just for fan-service and is boring. Meanwhile Ed is just there. She doesn't contribute anything except weird comic relief. Overall, the characters are so boring and the relationships between them are even more boring. The characters rarely actually interact with each other. The only time I was ever actually interested in the characters was around episode 10 during Spike's character episode. There was clear tension between the members of the crew, and that actually had me interested. However not only did this tension come out of nowhere, it also disappeared just as instantly as it was created. \
Enjoyment - 1\
Not a fun show at all. The action scenes are all incredibly boring. First of all they are just slow, and coupled with the fact that we know nothing serious is going to happen to the characters, there is zero excitement. \
Overall - 2\
cowboy Bebop is a bad show, and as I said earlier I cannot understand why people love it. Every element of the show is boring and cliche. People might say that it is unlike any other anime out there, but in reality it shares far more than it may seem. Like most anime, every character has a \"tragic\" backstory. These backstories also are randomly introduced and randomly vanish over the course of one or two episodes. Also this show is filled with fan-service, which people seem to just not have a problem with in this anime for some reason. Cowboy Bebop is only unique in the sense that no one on the show does anything unique or interesting.\

    Cowboy Bebop is, in effect, an episodic, slice of life sort of series revolving around our Space Cowboys (and girls) Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed. This review is here to tackle some points about the series I feel are worth mentioning, as I know it's all been said before.\
Now Cowboy Bebop has it all; great characters with good backstories, smooth animation, amazing music and lots of humor. So why don't I love it? Quite simply, Cowboy Bebop was a frustrating experience for me! I watched the series on and off over a couple of months, far longer than it normally takes for me to finish\
          \
        a series this short. I found it very off-putting that, with such interesting characters, the creators chose to spend so much time doing nothing with them! \
As others have mentioned, each episode is a hit or a miss. Some tackle the main characters, mix in some plot, throw in new characters or ideas and are just amazing overall. And then others are meandering and pointless. \
Now this is found in any slice-of-life series, it comes with the package. But in Cowboy Bebop it especially bothered me to spend an episode watching some character do something I could care less about when there are four amazing, interesting characters with stories that could fill several seasons sitting around and not getting anywhere! \
Vicious and Julia for example; why did we spend an episode watching Jet's old friend's daughter come to grips with her father's lack of affection for her? I honestly can't remember. And then you have Vicious and Julia's very few appearances despite being characters very important in the overall plot and intriguing characters in their own right.\
So before you hit the non helpful button, please remember that I do hold the series in high regard. It is a very well-made series that raises many interesting questions and concepts; and while some episodes frustrated me, others fascinated me. There's nothing wrong with the series, and I know many people like it's meandering nature and enjoy the lack of an over-arching plot (which, by the way, was rather tidily summed up in two eps at the end, nicely done). \
While my objective opinion is that it is a well-made series, well worth a watch, my subjective view wishes it was different, that it had been a story about Spike's past, about Vicious, about their friendship, about Julia's love and Jet and Faye's stories as well. It is because I loved the characters so much that I wanted more of them, wanted to see them more, know them more. \
Why are you still reading my review? Go check it out!\

    All things considered, there’s nothing quite like it when you come off an anime and realize how much it has built itself as this important piece of art that has since transcended its ever-present influence on other mediums. This particular show, named Cowboy Bebop, definitely lived up the legacy it deserves of being the pinnacle of late ’90s anime that would influence a wide variety of anime leading up to the new millennium. Even with all that has been all said and done, that’s not to say that Cowboy Bebop has its fair share of hiccups.\
But before I get into that, it is important to\
          \
        distinguish the inevitable nature that director Shinichirō Watanabe constructed from the ground up to make Cowboy Bebop’s world vibrant and distinct. Since Cowboy Bebop has separate plot arcs within each individual episode, with some continuity within its main cast, the show has a great sense of exploratory mystery behind every story being told. You have the sense of wanting to know of these actual people and locations because of how incredibly different they all are. They each have their own distinct look and atmosphere to them. As Watanabe is vastly known for, he loves to mix different types of genres into one show to make them feel unique in his eyes. Normally this could cause a show to lose some main focus as to what it wants to be, but Cowboy Bebop, thanks to its plot structure, paces these genres evenly to make us know the true identity of what it wants to be. Which is essentially a Space Western mixed with Neo-Noir elements in its tone; hence the show’s name.\
Along with mixing these genres, the sense of direction that encapsulates Cowboy Bebop as a whole transcends itself to a whole new level of creativity. The noir aspect to the show adds a lot more depth to its atmosphere from its attention-grabbing shootout scenes to the silent moments that hook you instantaneously. There are some comedy elements to be seen in Cowboy Bebop and they time it very well and give all the characters great charm to provide solid entertaining moments. They don’t just contain bodily comedy by any stretch, but instead, the writing is very sharp and witty whether you’re watching it dubbed or subbed.\
Memorable characters are in no shortage in Cowboy Bebop, at least within its main cast. Spike Spiegel, Faye Valentine, Jet Black, and Edward are the quintessential quartet to be studied if you are wanting to replicate a great cast such as this. They are not just good because of their excellent character growth, but the amazing chemistry they all have whenever any of them are on-screen together. At first they all act very indecent to each other. It isn’t until over the course of several episodes when they truly try to care for one another, yet they still feel the slight edge to go on their own for better or for worse.\
Spike is often regarded as the best character and they aren’t entirely wrong in saying so. He has an alluring presence where he isn’t just some strong individual who can handle himself in any given situation or this normal everyday person. He is simply both in some aspects. He has the wit and personality to be both of these types of personalities and you want to root for him because of his likable persona. Of course, it would be a crime to not mention the Dubbed performance by famed voice actor Stephen Blum who manages to make Spike have a lot of suave with his extraordinary voice. And for that matter, almost all of the English dubbed voice actors manage to make Cowboy Bebop one of the few instances where the dubbing is just as good, if not better, than the original Japanese voice acting.\
Faye Valentine provides some of the funniest, sarcastic humor to Cowboy Bebop. You could easily chalk her character archetype as a way to push a female character in a largely male present cast to let the males have their way with her body. However, they manage to make Faye into a girl who doesn’t take any kind of crap from anyone and has full-control over anything that she finds wrong in her own mind. Then we have Edward, who is by far the most eccentric character of the show by the fact that she’s in her own little world where nothing seems to make her overly pessimistic no matter how grave a situation might be. What makes her fascinating to watch is her growth as a person, while at the same time viewing her child-like charm in the same way we would have viewed Edward’s way of thinking as a child. Every time she’s on-screen, there is a good chance anything is possible in terms of comedic dialogue being thrown out,  and they are all fantastic to listen to. Lastly is Jet Black, who’s the most logically, down-to-earth character in the show, other than maybe Spike in most cases. While he may be the lesser of the three other leads, there is no doubt to be made that Jet has his fair share of memorable moments that grows him into a true three-dimensional character like the rest.\
Now with this being said about our four main heroes, the rest of the side characters that crop up in these plot arcs are not anything spectacular or memorable in the slightest. Even the main villain of the show doesn’t really leave much of an impression in being a noteworthy villain as originally anticipated. This could be forgiven slightly, considering they have only one episode to build them up, but that is not to say all of them are not noteworthy with the Dr. Lobbes character being the best of the bunch. Considering that he was in one of the best episodes that wasn’t the last three episodes that succeeded it.\
Around the time when Cowboy Bebop first aired, anime recently had begun somewhat of a transitional period where it started to incorporate very challenging, philosophical themes into its narrative. The other two that come to mind are Neon Genesis Evangelion and Serial Experiments Lain. That’s not to say anime did not have anything like this before, but Cowboy Bebop and the rest of the shows I mentioned really pushed it of the stream-of-consciousness into the anime community. With that said, Cowboy Bebop seems to be the one that is the most subtle way of detailing its philosophical themes involving existential concepts. This is both a service and disservice to the show’s credit.\
The reason being is that although it is very admirable for Bebop to showcase its themes in a non-preachy scenario or be muddled into strange concepts that contradict each other, it subtly limits it from doing anything with most of the narrative plot arcs. You can basically watch Cowboy Bebop and have all of them fly over your head and you would still have the same experience, but once you do notice them, there’s not a lot of meat to them for our brains to digest or comprehend. Obviously the finale of the show has a great implication of putting them all together but in the long run, they don’t really add up to anything, other than trying to throw out whatever philosophical theme that might seem the most probable in these given situations.\
While that aspect wasn’t necessarily one of the show’s best highlights, the actual plot that carries the main narrative is relatively serviceable and brings up one of the most poignant finales that I’ve ever seen in anime. When you feel the growth that all of these characters go through, you never want these characters to go away from one another because of how amazing they play off one another. In fact, once I saw them go their separate ways for a moment, without spoiling any of the important details, I almost felt upset that they even had the inclination of wanting to do so in the first place. Because of the amount of care given to make the personalities of these characters genuine and delightful, the melancholic nature near the finale feels very sincere. If that is writing that could not be considered great by that fact alone, I don’t know what is.\
I’ve always held the belief that Yoko Kanno is one of the best composers to be working in anime to this day, and Cowboy Bebop reigns as the best coordinated orchestration that she’s ever done. The opening itself garners some needed praise not only for its recognizable melodies and instrumentation but how it captures the feel and tone of Cowboy Bebop as a whole. What really fits Yoko’s style of instrumentation and Watanabe’s creative vision is how they both have the same way of mixing different styles of music and genres that make them feel very on-point to the direction of the art-style and the score that goes with it. Yoko’s amazing blend of jazz, normal orchestration, guitar rock, and occasional electronics are what create the ultimate soundtrack that would be worthy of being listened to without the need for the show’s visuals to accompany it.\
Does Cowboy Bebop deserve the amount of perfect accolades that it has been given for the past decade or so? In most aspects, it certainly does. There is simply nothing out there that is quite like it in terms of authentic style and flair that is on-screen at any given point in time. It manages to perfectly pace the witty humor from the deep drama that engulfs each character and the confrontations they have to face, one way or the other. If anything, the characters are enough to warrant a watch from their amazing chemistry and the plot can be well-serviceable for anyone willing to experience it. It’s a show that literally goes off with a bang and soars ever so gently off into the blissful reaches of the heavens. In great character stories such as this, this space cowboy is one that can prove himself worthy of being called such a title.\

    \"Cowboy Bebop\" reeks. It really does. It reeks of originality, it reeks of attitude, but most of all, it reeks of perfection.\
I'm not gonna bother writing about how cool the main protagonist Spike Spiegel is, or how colourful the rest of the cast are - those are established facts and have been discussed to death already, so I'm gonna write about what makes \"Cowboy Bebop\" different instead. Almost everything about it is unusual. It's a clash of a huge number of often contradicting styles that, on paper, looks like disasters waiting to happen. However, the reality is that \"Cowboy Bebop\" takes everything in its stride\
          \
        and pulls off the stunt with flying colours. It catches the attention straight away with its strikingly retro opening sequence reminiscent of a typical jazzy 70/80's TV series. The feel of the anime itself is a seamless marriage of anime sci-fi and American westerns, backed up by some slick jazz/blues (as well as other African-American influenced) sound track. Even discounting these obvious western influences, it's still very un-anime like in a lot of respects - the art style goes for what I would call stylish realism, it's very slightly comically oriented, with no giant eyed cuteness or super distortions in sight. The humour it uses is also mostly toned down, subtle, western humour as opposed to the in your face, over the top slap stick found in most other anime. And yet, at other times, its anime roots shine through brightly - for example the character design of Vicious, with his katana and grey/white hair, is about as anime as you can get (well, maybe he could do with longer hair, like Sephiroth's from Final Fantasy VII).\
Even in its content, \"Cowboy Bebop\" breaks new ground. It doesn't go for a long continuous plot, but instead opts for the episodic format, but with one flagship storyline spanning 5 episodes that pops in during various parts of the series. This doesn't sound special by itself, but what is remarkable is the sheer diversity found in the episodes. It proclaims itself to be a work that \"becomes a new genre in itself\", which might sound arrogant to the point of delusional. But this bold, swaggering claim actually has a ring of truth to it. \"Cowboy Bebop\" is like a huge number of genres combined, and yet doesn't fully fit into any particular one simply because it's composed of so many. Like one of those annoying people that you used to know from school who is good at everything, whatever genre \"Cowboy Bebop\" touches turns to gold. The comedy is hilarious, the action is edge of the seat stuff, and the horror themed episodes do manage to create a kind of unsettling atmosphere of anticipation and suspense. I think almost everyone will find something to their taste. Moreover, since I haven't anything like this done before, and anything that comes after that dares to attempt anything that's even remotely similar will be seen as copying (for example, even though \"Samurai Champloo\", produced by the same person, is an undoubted success, it had no where near the impact of \"Cowboy Bebop\"), \"Cowboy Bebop\" has effectively cemented itself as a unique experience in a class of its own. \
Quite a few of the episodes in \"Cowboy Bebop\" reveals some of the characters' backgrounds, but they don't reveal everything. For the most part, only subtle hints are given, and you're left to join up the sparsely distributed dots using your own imagination. Usually I hate this kind of thing, but you know what? In the special case of \"Cowboy Bebop\", it somehow WORKS. In this case, less is more, the show's incomplete state feels just right, and the tantalising bits of clues and short flashbacks piece together into a enigmatic, fragmental past that adds to rather than detract from the flavour of the anime. There is no better example of this than during the flagship storyline where we catch a glimpse of Spike's mysterious past. In fact these episodes deserves special mention - they are clearly meant to be the diamonds amongst the gems. In crafting these episodes, the creators obviously asked themselves the question: the short stories' collective strength lies their variety, so what can we do with this central attraction to make it stand out? The answer was obvious: it was to make it into something that's the very definition of awesomeness. And boy did they achieve it. The general gist of this story is Spike settling scores with Vicious, an old enemy from his little known past. It's a classic set up that's been used many, many times before, and on the face of it, \"Cowboy Bebop\" doesn't really bring anything new to the table. But saying this segment of \"Cowboy Bebop\" is just another one of those show down between nemesis stories is like saying J. S. Bach is just another Baroque composer. Bach was not known as an innovator, and distinguished himself as the greatest composer of his time simply by being so much better than everyone else. In the same way, \"Cowboy Bebop\" took a much used idea and, despite not doing anything that's different, produced something that's on a completely different plane to everything else. Everything about \"Cowboy Bebop\" is already smooth and polished, but in those episodes the production somehow manages to climb up yet another level, and every single fiber of it is executed to perfection.\
That Spike vs Vicious segment of \"Cowboy Bebop\" is so good in fact, that viewers often mistake it as the only story \"Cowboy Bebop\" is trying to tell, and thus the other episodes naturally gets mistaken as fillers, and this is one of the most common criticisms levelled at \"Cowboy Bebop\" - it's composed almost entirely of fillers. But I think this is missing the whole point of the series. Just like a serious show should not be faulted for not being funny, \"Cowboy Bebop\" should not be faulted for being episodic, but should be judged based on what it's trying to achieve. What it is trying to achieve is variety, and thus purposefully avoided the continuous story format. Those \"fillers\" are essential building blocks towards achieving this aim, and so shouldn't really be regarded as fillers at all. Real fillers would be like in \"Full Moon wo Sagashite\", where they actually got a continuous story to tell, but instead of telling it chose to go faffing around on mostly unrelated mini adventures that nearly put me to sleep. The key question is does \"Cowboy Bebop\" deliver what it's trying to deliver, and there is no doubt in my mind that is does.\
It's generally acknowledged that \"Cowboy Bebop\" is not a deep anime, so the fact that shows up at the top of so many critics' list arguably makes it the biggest triumph for a style over substance anime. The show's ending theme is called \"The Real Folk's Blues\" (ironically, it's actually a rock song) - rather appropriately, I thought, because this series frequently give rise to some of the most contemplative, melancholy moments despite not being terribly deep. These kind of moments often left me with a feeling of immense fulfilment as the end credits starts to roll. Perhaps it's this engimatic quality that lends it that special aura. It may not be my personal favourite, but unlike, say, \"Elfen Lied\", I can certainly see why it deserves to be labelled as the greatest ever - I, for one, am not about to argue against it.\

    \"Cowboy Bebop is a generally overrated Anime that now is mostly famous due to its continues element of referencing Western pop culture, high-quality OST and well animated action sequences, however doesn’t offer neither too much in actual substance nor actual characterization worth mentioning in its episodic narrative\". \
This aforementioned statement has more or less become the popular opinion regarding Cowboy Bebop, a highly popular Anime TV-series, which’s first episode aired in April 1998. Being part of the \"trio\" with both Trigun and Berserk (excluding the heavily controversial Evangelion for now), it’s one of the first Anime-series which did grow a considerable large fanbase in the\
          \
        West in the 90’s, without being a Fighting-Shounen aired on evening’s time like DBZ or essentially being a Mahou-Shoujo like Sailor Moon is. Naturally, a show with Bebop’s setting, style and overload of original soundtracks in English was bound to appeal to a Western audience at least in some way and as time stands, Bebop managed to stay stronger as its two “brothers in arms” trying to conquer hearts of potential Western fans for a long time now and established itself as a somewhat cult-cartoon, even only be it in the US. However, as time progressed and Anime become much more popular caused by online streaming, heavily increasing the knowledge and accessibility of numerous different titles, the show did tend fall out of peoples’ favourites of both casual Anime watchers and fans of critically acclaimed Anime with surprisingly common reasoning, especially because the things I’ve mentioned in the first paragraph. As much as I think that some of these statements have at least a grain of truth in them (while I take them with a grain of salt), they’re either minor criticism or undermining the huge power it has in both its overarching theme-exploration and its ingenious use of an episodical narrative, not taking away any quality from it, but rather carve it in stone. Even though a lot of people are not digging each show of the aforementioned trio for some totally legitimate reasons, it’s almost impossible to take away the most important aspect within each of them, landing a much bigger hit on a more mature audience, than the other popular Anime during these times did. Berserk’s slow, but superb incorporation dark, fantastical elements into its gritty medieval setting, Trigun’s good balance of comedy and darker story elements and Cowboy Bebop’s…well I’m about to show you my personal take on this series’ qualities, as I try to play along those lines of its Jazz.\
\
1. Pushing The Sky\
\
Being listed as one of the most influential \"Space-Western\" up until this day, the setting of Bebop hovers both lots of potential to either exceed peoples’ expectations, or to majorly disappoint them when looking for the wrong thing, namely the show being a Space-Opera in a classic sense, inevitably hinting at Legend of the Galactic Heroes. As the series prolongs, it’s more of a mixture of multiple genres, which evidently can have a quite diverse feeling to them. For example, \"slice of life\"-esque episodes are getting mixed in with clearly experimental episodic stories + storytelling. By stating that fact, it’s even more remarkable that the series is able to pull off these kinds of tone-shifts with such ease and fluency, while still providing something of value for each individual episode, be it in story-telling, character-insight or excellently creative directing, a challenge most Anime not only have trouble accomplishing to begin with, but don’t even come close to the quality it facilitated. \
The lack of a progressing story in Bebop is easily justified by it using the episodic-style to its absolute advantage, implementing a highly interesting factor for its characters among numerous other masterfully executed aspects, which will be tackled a little later in this review. While the series offers a kind of coherent main-storyline, which gets its first big reveal in episode 5, most of the other episodes have a tendency to classify themselves in one of two categories with partially fluent borders, while the first one dominates in prevalence: Either as an exploration and continuation of already introduced themes (f.e. the famous “being stuck in time”-conflict) like “Waltz for Venus #8” or a refreshingly light-hearted, facetious and \"tribute-paying\" episode like “Cowboy Funk #22”. While the thematic value of each individual story might just vary for every viewer, these episodes have the capability to really hit hard and build up on already introduced conflicts, making it really questionable if those episodes really should be called mere “side-stories” to begin with, since their coherency in exploration is absolutely on par with the main one. \
Of course it helps, that competently executed episodic storytelling is often the cream of the crop I’m searching for in this medium, upping the value of the series even more for me personally.\
The Bebop crew visits different planets, gets engaged into different ship-battles, meets different people of different beliefs, kicks different villains’ butts and manages to pay homage to so many different titles of Western pop culture it’s insane. Starting with more obvious ones like Spike’s incredibly similar style of fighting to Bruce Lee, which feels almost like a \"flow of water\", to minor references of Blade Runner (episode #7, character named Decker) and many more. I honestly don’t want to list more of them, since I’d be lying if I say that I did get them all by myself, but more importantly because this aspect has been endlessly covered already and being used to define the homages as one of its biggest strengths, while it only is a minor one. It’s true that these aspects accompanied by the stylistic ass-kicking both the crew and their villains receive over the course of the series offer the simple assumption, that the show is not more than a merely rule-of-cool type of show, which has become some kind of tainted term in the anime community, at least from my perspective. Cowboy Bebop undeniably borrows a lot of ‘rule-of-cool’, however is able to provide much more than that, creating an immediate oxymoron going by its popular definition. It’s more of a stylistic approach by the show's director Watanabe, or by Anime in general, to pay respect to both the popular action and the classical film noir genre in the West, creating both a unique and refreshing appearance in the Anime medium.\
\
2. Words That We Couldn’t Say (Major Spoilers ahead!)\
\
Probably the second most important, or even the most important aspect why Bebop qualifies for all the praise it gets, is the handling of its cast with utmost care and competency. Combined with the ingenious audiovisual storytelling, it’s what the show’s identity defines in hindsight. Without it, breaking the general idea behind almost every (non main-story related) epsiode apart is quite a breeze and would go something like this: \
1. The crew set their sight on a new high-reward bounty.\
2. They make a plan on how to catch the bounty alive.\
3. Something goes wrong, their target gets killed or escapes.\
Of course this is, as mentioned before, a heavily watered-down version of how its episodic storytelling actually works and is functioning as a criticism, that is quite common to hear: “The individual stories are too repetitive” is one of these classic examples I tend to hear a lot, especially in recent times. It might be a legitimate reason to severely decrease one’s enjoyment of a show, but won’t work well as hitting criticism for the show, since the simplicity of said episodes served as just the right set-up to dive into the characters’ behaviour, which is connected deep within Bebop’s unarguable main thematic: All characters of the the crew suffer from not being able to advance in their own future, since they’re plagued by their past bringing them down. This becomes clearer the longer the series progresses, studying on how they firstly act as “apathetic outsiders” when confronted with stories and emotions of strangers (even their own bounty), but over the course of the episode they see them as projections of their own problems and happenings in the past, finally making them feel empathy and acting \"out of character\". Clear hints for that are scattered all over the series, for instance when the crew is letting their prey escape, Jet being lenient on Spike after their big dispute and then not even bringing in ther bounty, even when they would need the cash so desperately. \
Balancing all of these aspects undermines another big strength of Cowboy Bebop: It manages to convey all the aforementioned without ever feeling preachy or washy in its runtime. When looking on how well it all wrapped up, Watanabe just has to be the main suspect responsible for all the aspects to run like clockwork, displaying few hints here and there in several episodes, making effective use of subtext in dialogues, heavily including the OST in its storytelling and therefore finding the perfect balance between style and substance, Watanabe managed to fit it all in. \
Furtherly examining and putting singular characters into spotlight is a very interesting task in this series, especially when talking about the crew of bounty hunters themselves. \
When starting with the protagonist of the show, Spike Spiegel, we already found ourselves a true gem to analyze, probably even exceeding the other two incredibly interesting crew members of Bebop. Spike is a former member of the \"Red-Dragon-Syndicate\" and now an independent bounty hunter. A feud inside the syndicate, involving an only hinted triangle-conflict between Spike, Julia (Spike’s light of love) and Vicious (the main antagonist) led to violent confrontations within the Syndicate, mainly involving Spike, Vicious and his adherents. Spike makes an (ultimately futile) attempt to fake his own death, Julia manages to flee and Vicious stays within the syndicate in an aspirational position. \
Spike’s central-conflict of the show is exemplary for the very similar conflicts of his comrades: The inability of moving forward or changing his perception of life itself, because of him being tied to the crucial events of his past, even when absolutely trying to forget or starting to deny that said fact. Probably the most tragic one of the bunch, Spike’s past does have the highest ability to come back for him and most cruel, just when he was able to move on it did strike its last fatal blow. Viciously being robbed of his loved one, the sole light in his past was the ultimate nail in the coffin for no return. The crows, both Vicious’ symbol and for all the hardships Spike has been through in this past and still clings upon to resolve, is an interesting thing to talk about, as they’re seen multiple times before Spike is engaged in battle with Vicious (episode #5 church scene) or a crow is shown waking Spike up from his dreams, after he was being shot by a subsequently revealed tranquilizer. Furtherly supporting the crisis Spike goes through during his journey, are the little bits we get to hear from the way he’s talking to others about his past, clearly hinting at the happenings in the syndicate (“I was killed once before…by a woman”) or his overall futile actions to resist being dragged down into stagnation from his backstory (“It feels like I’m watching a bad dream I’ll never wake up from”). \
Jet Black, the seemingly rather reserved \"head’ of the crew, also gets explored rather fantastically, when thinking about how little screen time his conflicts did have in contrast to Spike and Faye. Jet is a former member of the ISSP (Inter System Solar Police), positioned at Ganymed (a moon of Jupiter). He joined the Bebop after he left the ISSP due to an incident, involving him losing one arm and had it replaced with a mechanical one.  Jet acts as an adequate counter-pole for Spike by comparing their past alone. But not only do they really differ in their backstory and journey to the Bebop, they also greatly differ in personality. While Jet still has not lost his ability to care for others not involved in his own backstory to that severe amount as the for example Spike did, his reserved deep care for his comrades also shows more through actions than through words. Albeit he frequently warns the crew from taking any reckless actions, he usually falls back into a played facade of apathy shortly afterwards. This attitude often dissolves with him doing someone a favour/kind gesture at the end of an episode, even though that someone usually disagreed with Jet's beliefs and plans. The interaction between Spike and Jet on the run to its finale is one of the most noteworthy examples of “show don’t tell”, when talking about the atmosphere created by the audiovisuals, or one of the best examples of conveying emotions through simple dialogue and analogies I’ve seen in the medium so far. \
Adding the third member to the bunch, a lot of people seem to prefer Faye’s backstory over every other in Cowboy Bebop and they do so justly. While it might not be my personal favourite, since I found Spike’s to be even more engrossing, Faye is the only member who goes through ‘by the book’ development during her conquest to retrieve her lost memories.\
Faye is 23 years old, cold-hearted on the surface, depraved and one clever and dangerous individual to be reckoned with despite her very femininely attractive physique. Over the course of the series we get to learn, that Faye’s memories has been completely erased due to the 54-years long cryogenic sleep she’s been put through. This cryogenic treatment was undertaken, in order to save her life by waiting until the medical technology was advanced as much to treat her fatal injuries, which would’ve caused her death back then. That functions as a very interesting setup to see Faye’s actual development caused by the retrieval of her memories in bits and pieces, in contrast to Spike and Jet’s development basically finished before we jump into Bebop’s storyline. Furthermore, her chase after a place where she truly belongs does prove to be really difficult, since her relatives are nowhere to be seen and her former home planet Earth is now uninhabitable due to the devastation from numerous meteor strikes while she was sleeping and harbours an initial disdain towards the crew of bounty hunters. The show manages to explore the core-conflict splendidly, creating both heart-breaking moments (e.g. the end of episode #24 “Hard Luck Woman”) and a tremendously emotional climax out of the pretty basic setup, which ensnarls itself deeply with Spike’s conflict in the concluding episodes. This might as well verify once again, that simplicity in a show’s basic conflict can very well lead to superbly connected theme exploration, in Bebop’s case in a very subtle but discernible manner. I very much appreciate Watanabe’s attempt to neither try to look incredibly smart or complex at any point in its runtime as well, since it would take away large bits from the qualities Bebop set itself up through its overall “rule-of-cool-ish” style on the surface and subtle hints on the thematic depth of characters’ backstories. \
While Ed is lacking in the character-section there’s an argument to be made, that she is not as important of a character, because of her lacking in character-depth in relatively to the rest of the bunch and that is entirely true when only talking about her as a character and not how her eventual farewell from the Bebop crew influences both Spike and Jet personally. While I can definitely agree on her lacking as a singular character in comparison, I simply cannot agree with the criticism, that there’s a lack of character chemistery, since it’s the show’s intention to make especially Spike’s and Faye’s relation to every crew-member as cold as impossible, as them being stuck in the past life and not being able to indulge themselves into new, close relations is basically the main theme of Bebop entirely. \
\
3. Gotta Knock A Little Harder\
\
As fans of the series might have all already noticed, I tried to name my headers for each individual section of my review after actual songs in the Cowboy Bebop OST. While I tried to use it only as a creative and a bit more stylistic approach to properly segment my review, Bebop does not only use it stylistically or “just” to provide atmosphere, how virtually every other audiovisual medium tries to use it. No, it incorporates the music directly in its storytelling actively, leaving it to the tracks to tell a story, leaving it to the music to...convey a message. Yoko Kanno and her particularly for this occasion formed band ‘The Seatbelts’ did create a total amount of 6h worth of an incredibly diverse and magnificent soundtrack, to both harmonize with the visuals and multiple different conflicts of the individual stories to create the right mood for e.g. melancholic (‘Adieu’ playing at the end of episode 8), unsettling (introduction of the ‘Pierrot Le Feu’ in episode 20) or light-hearted/relaxed moments (the crew chilling on the ship after a done job etc.). As I already said, by the sheer amount of diversity Cowboy Bebop offers through its runtime. The OST has to not only have a solidly high budget and talented musicians to create such a high diversity of tracks in terms of feeling, tonality etc., it also has to keep a distinctive identity through the runtime of the show, if at all possible, rather than a garden variety of different, non-comparable single tracks, that make the not only the OST’s, but also the show’s identity to slowly drift into the whatever-territory for me. Bebop managed to keep its distinctive identity though, much, much better than I initially expected before my re-watch, since they managed to keep a prominent focus on Jazz, with little outliers to count, that didn’t complement the complete work at all. To pick some of the most talented musicians to be featured in numerous Anime soundtracks, known for her huge talent to cover lots of different genres, Yoko and her crew were almost definitely the best choice, especially for a show that reliant on effective usage of its OST on one hand and very solidly matching singular tracks during action-scenes and what not. \
Incorporating its soundtrack effectively in its storytelling, be it with lyrics, merging with the visuals to effectively use nonverbal communication between the viewer etc. is a task only a few shows in the medium have actively tried, and it's even more of a rarity to find a series which did actually execute this efficiently. However, even then I’d be lying, if I said any show deserves the #1 spot other than Bebop. Along with the characters it’s definitely my favourite aspect about the show, because it knows to effectively pull the trigger in key-moments, during its continues character-conflicts and builds a strong foundation around those moments through several hints in dialogue and even simple postures and gestures being used to tell more about ones’ feelings in several occasions, furtherly accompanied by the score. The series just does understand people too well, to intersperse that much attention to detail in the mentioned gestures/postures and mimic to show a character’s condition is something live-action movies tend to do very well, but Anime regularly struggles with. The most noteworthy moments I remember would be the all so famous church scene in episode #5, when Spike faces the ghost of his past, Vicious, the first time over the course of the story. The played song when Spike approaches his future battleground, “Rain”, manages to both set in the right tone through instrumentals and manages to tell a story on its own, deeply connected with the main theme of being stuck in the past, as it even gets specified in the lyrics itself. To furtherly raise the stakes of how good the audiovisuals act together in this episode alone, is Spike’s falling sequence, where we get to see bits and pieces of already in episode #1 foreshadowed the happenings around Vicious’ and Spike’s bitter dispute and the bloody feud resulting from the growing rivalry in the syndicate. \
Ed leaving the Bebop crew in episode #24 has also been a masterfully executed, melancholic bit of the show, with the crew members’ downtrodden sadness of another member leaving, while the other one seemingly doesn't come back anymore. Again, this is most importantly conveyed through gesture and music alone, as we see Spike and Jet to superficially process the shock through as simple as to forcefully eat the eggs Jet wanted to cook for the whole crew, as they were revoltingly going down their throats. The interconnectivity between the beginning of episode #12 (Space Lion, Part I) and ending of episode #13 (Part II) usage of the same track, the end of episode #1’s villain, Jet chasing the criminal boyfriend of his ex with a swift tune more than an exhilerating track in episode #10 (Ganymede Elegy), the music box at the end of episode #8, the both unsettling tragic conclusion to episode #20 Pierrot Le Fou (furtherly supported by the grotesque imagery in the theme park) and the final two episodes in general are even further display of the OST greatly interacting with Cowboy Bebop’s narrative in key character and story-moments.\
\
4. The Real Folk Blues (approaching the finale)\
\
As I’ve already mentioned several times how the finale is absolutely terrific, however I still have yet to explain why it hit me as hard as it certainly did.\
Episode 25 starts off with Vicious’ attempts to bring down the established leadership finally being shut down, the elders taking appropriate action and arresting Vicious, soon to be killed anyways. Furthermore, Spike and Jet get attacked by pursuers of the syndicate, fatally wounding Jet on one of his legs. Faye, on her own journey, meets Julia on her way, also being persuaded by the syndicate’s desperate attempts to tie up loose ends. Faye manages to escape with Julia alive, learning this Julia is indeed the line of light Spike so desperately seeks and gets the mission to tell Spike, that she’ll be waiting ‘there’. Back at the ship, Faye arrives just before another attack of gets launched at the crew, with Spike seemingly accepting his upcoming death, but when Spike hears that Faye had met Julia and now delivers a distinctive message to him, it sparks his survival instinct in an instant. \
As there are many aspects to focus on in this episode, my preference might just be how Spike and Jet interact with each other, since this is probably the most telling when talking about the emotional conditions these characters face themselves in having. Firstly, Jet’s severe injury and probable inability to advance the Bebop through the hardships to come that have already started, raises even more doubts in Spike’s mind to finally give into his past chasing him down, mostly implied through posture and overall silence/consternation Spike gives off the definite feeling of having. Jet did both notice Spike’s state of mind through his entire journey, as he’s unwillingly relentless and is almost acting “out of character” when his bits and pieces of his backstory come to shine through, and the sudden change for the worse, when Ed left and him and Spike getting attacked in a mundane situation and tries to both give an analogy in what kind of situation Spike is stuck in and he was stuck in before, before he learned how to let go. Jet’s words do reach spike, but his inability of letting go still goes on, while his will to life was fading away ever so slowly, reaching its maximum when another attack of the syndicate gets launched at them, right after Faye makes her comeback to the crew (“Oh well, it was going to happen sooner or later”). However, Faye mentioning the possibility of meeting Julia once again, at the said venue that was planned in the past before Vicious interfered, does give Spike hope once again, not only perceptible in mimic, but also the general comeback of his attitude of “pushing through”, when directly confronted with problems unleashed by his past. The final push Spike needed to get his will back was Jet, furtherly encouraging him when he’s seen the spark of life coming back into Spike by the sole mention of his beloved one (“Go grasp that thing that you have lost”), all meanwhile Vicious manages to take over control of the syndicate by the means of a double-coup, setting up the stage perfectly for (one of) the most memorable finales in anime history. Along with Julia’s death in episode #26 and the confrontation of Spike and Faye right before the final showdown, adding their individual progress, but greatly differing conclusions both characters have made for themselves, the final episode delivers a conclusion which does not disappoint in any way and reaches a catharsis that feels both personal and incredibly uplifting, considering the events leading up to it. \
\
5. Conclusion:\
\
Over the course of this review, I mostly did praise Bebop above and beyond heavens and while I still tried to reflect a lot of reoccurring points of criticism based on the fact, that these rather serve as minor criticisms or even nitpicks, because of how incredibly much the show exceeds them in other (and even related) levels. There’s still a somewhat fair point to be made for most of them, since they can greatly influence a show’s personal appeal and investment, basically the name of game for Bebop. Although the argument of inconsistent quality can be dismissed by the show’s episodic nature, it’s true that there are similar anime (like Mushishi) in terms of narrative, which are a little more consistent over the course of their runtime, but also never reach the greatness of Bebop’s best episodes and interconnectivity, making it even more difficult on how to evaluate “quality” in this precedent matter. \
With all things said and done, I may just come to the general conclusion, that Cowboy Bebop is an absolute must-watch for fans of episodic-storytelling, westernly-influenced style, incredible character-depth being explored in a more than interestingly unique way and both, one of the rawest emotional experiences and the most excellently cathartic ending in Anime I've seen so far, almost certain that I could change the last four words to \"of all time\" as well.\

    Story, Character, and Enjoyment: 10/10 Drama Llama? \
Cowboy Bebop is probably the most amazing anime I have had the privilege of watching. Even now, seven years after watching it for the first time I am having difficulty putting it into words. What is so unique about it is how the episodes don't link together, but instead mainly focus on a character or two. Director Shinichiro Watanabe did such an amazing job flushing out the characters whether the current episode shows them living their day-by-day life in the present, or delving into a certain characters unique past it really makes the Cowboy Bebop universe seem tangible.\
          \
        Unfortunately this is also Cowboy Bebop's downfall. Not because it's bad, but because so many people pass this by thinking it has no story. To those that think this is the case I encourage you to go back, and watch the whole thing. Not only does this anime give you the most amazing character development it manages to weave in a story along the way right under your nose. Until the last two episodes hit, then you will understand what it was all about. When it was all said and done for me my first time through, and the series came to an end, I felt like I had just witnessed my best friend get run over by a bus. Most people probably think that sounds terrible, but it takes something truly great to yank that much emotion out of you.\
Animation: 10/10 Keepin' it real.\
CB's animation is truly something to behold. It matches very well with the character development in making the whole series seem tangible. Character proportions are well regulated, and maintained through the whole thing. Which is very important to me in an anime. It does a much better job then huge block buster animes being released now, e.g. Naruto/Bleach.\
When you speak about animation of CB you definitely have to speak of the action sequences. The gunfights, and hand-to-hand combat are superb. Spike constantly gets injured also making it seem much more realistic, and interesting. The best part though about them is there is hardly any bullshit talking interrupting   the action. I don't know about you, but I hate when two characters stop in the middle of a fight to drink some tea, and have a ten minute conversation, emo flash-back included. I could go on and on, but then what would be the point of you watching it.\
Sound: 10/10 The hills are alive...\
Tank! is absolutely the only anime music I will ever have included in my play-list.  Which says a lot, because normally when I start an episode of something fresh off the torrents I pretty much skip past the opening theme. That being said, CB is deeply rooted in Jazz music, but it all sounds beautiful when played side by side with the anime. I've never been much a musician, but I do know what I enjoy, and what I don't enjoy. It all sounds excellent, and I'm not a big jazz fan at all.   Not to mention Yoko Kanno mentioned to slap some Pink Floyd into episode 20, Perriot le Fou. Don't believe me? Go pop in Dark Side of the Moon, and skip to track 2.\
Overall Cowboy Bebop is one big tribute to many cultures. Whether it be John Woo style gun fights, the Indian sitting in his tee-pee with his playstation, 1337 haxxors, or the Japanese's immense fear of dieing. There is a lot that Cowboy Bebop parodies while still managing to keep itself original. I'm tired of all the dime-a-dozen anime characters. E.g. the clumsy yet dormant super powerful main character, or the silent bad ass who's family died, and is in all reality an emo kid screaming out for attention. I've seen both these character types a hundred times over. This is why I idolize Cowboy Bebop, and truly believe that it is the best anime of all time.   ",

    I hear so often from ppl saying Cowboy Bebop is the \"absolute best\" anime ever made. maybe 10 years ago, but Cowboy Bebop is soooo far from that title now. So my post here will be blatantly contrasted from this point of view to compensate, rather than being more of a middle ground review that i otherwise might have written.\
I think most ppl are still inflating the ratings on this series due to it being a landmark or a breakthrough. it can hardly be argued to keep it in that position after so may great other animes have come out. Take Samurai Champloo alone, which\
          \
        is done by the same director, has the same format, and even uses the same type of character molds. that is clearly way more amazing (not just cz of modern graphics but in many many other respect as well) than CB. \
 It's not \"so cool\" it's as typical as an anime can get. People say just chilling out in space, and doing fun episodic things is so amazing and novel, but it's totally not! it's the most overdone setting ever. I just don't understand why ppl think it's so new. Despite all that, if a series is still enjoyable, then hey, what works works, but Cowboy Bebop didn't blow me away in this department either. My level of enjoyment was pretty average, if not below. \
and no, the charcter development is not outstanding either. many other animes do a way better job. that buff older guy is hardly developed. only the girl is somewhat interesting. the younger kid is just weird that it makes her seem a non-person. Spice and Wolf, K-On, Lucky Star, Samurai Champloo, even Bleach for many of the characters (not all) have better character development than Cowboy Bebop.\
setting original? give me a break! space travelers. bounty hunters? how more commonplace can you get?\

Samurai Champloo has a similar format as this but actually IS \"so cool\". the atmosphere, the aura, the music actually is great. cowboy bebop is a pale attempt that doesn't cut it the way Samurai Champloo does\
cowboy bebop fans, there is no way this series deserves to be on the pedestal that it has been placed on surprisingly. There's nothing unique about this, there's nothing ultra novel about it. Why do you insist that it is?",

    I was scared to touch this anime. Despite the reviews, despite my friend's sage advice, despite everything, I resisted for months. I didn't want to dive into something that showed only on Adult Swim at 2 in the morning on weekdays. It didn't seem like the kind of show I wanted to watch. I want to see the latest and greatest, the anime that grab the headlines, that are here and now, that are modern and are visually appealing. Cowboy Bebop didn't seem to me like it fit into any category I ever liked either. Western styled mixed with space drama? How can that even\
          \
        mix? Old style animation from the late 90s? Kinda makes me think of Hey Arnold and those other shows. It just didn't seem to fit the mood I currently reside in. And then I picked up the first episode. And I am a changed man. \
First, some background: it's a simple enough story. Spike and Jet, two oddities that somehow coexist inside the same spaceship, are partnered together in the pursuit of so-called bounties (fitting the western theme), and thus are called bounty hunters. Along the way in the beginning, they pick up some more companions to put the word \"rag-tag\" to shame: Faye Valentine, a debt-ridden woman who has forgotten her past, Ed (Edward), the pre-teen genius girl with computers, and Ein, the genetically enhanced and intelligent Corgi. The five travel the stars, attempting to gain bounties, but the results are....somewhat mixed.\
Story: 9/10\
I was skeptical. I truly was. I never liked western films, and I never cared for the themes and such of the Ol' Wild West. But the meld of science fiction with modern amenities really hit home. I could actually relate to the story, and oh what a story it was. Besides being such a motley bunch, they often were never agreeable and seemed to barely hold the peace in Jet's ship Bebop. But something about the way the story was told, how each character's mysterious past seemed to interfere with the present. Half of the series wasn't really fighting for bounties, but trying to bury or avoid their individual past without notifying or effecting the other persons aboard the ship, to no avail. It was interesting, then, when the past comes back to haunt you: nothing is as it seems on the surface, and when the past scratches at its coffin, you better be there with a nail or sig-sauer. \
Art: 10/10\
I must say, at first it was hard to....understand and perceive the old-style animation. This made me want to turn it off and watch the anime of today. But you got used to it real quick. And I must say, for something almost two decades old, it's gorgeous. The lighting, the style, the drawings, the shades, the colors, the environment...It was hard not to notice the variety of places the art alluded to, and of course the western touch with the deserts and saloons and gunfights and such. I loved every bit of it, and remember, I hate the west. The spaceships juxtaposed next to the average car and the old-fashioned lighters lighting old-fashioned cigarettes created this interesting mood and ambiance, one I hadn't felt....ever. It was surreal.\
Sound: 9.5/10\
Alright, before you blast me with why it isn't perfect, it wasn't. But it was damn near perfect. Jazz? Blues? Fast-paced music? Are those ENGLISH lyrics? Yes they all are here, for you, the watcher, to enjoy. Every major scene had a fast-paced song, and many a time it was in English. The producers and editors and such probably drew much of their inspiration from the American West, and it showed well in the sound. The OP was fast-paced and well executed, and the ED was nostalgic sounding and epic. But I didn't get too focused on the petty ending and beginning; it was the background music I'm talking about. Beautiful, beautiful salute to the American west and native American music. I couldn't get enough, especially when the main characters are so motley, the odd choice of music just made the mood that much better. And why stop there? The voice actors should be praised, no given medals, their acting was so good. It wasn't even the way each character spoke, but when each character decided to show his or her true nature to the viewer before quickly covering it up; beautiful just beautiful. \
Character: 10/10\
Oh how I would rate this higher if I could. I've never had such deep characters before, such amazingly portrayed people. Pretend each character is a book: Spike would be a carefree one, its leather new, its polish gleaming. Jet would be gruff and rough on the edges, worn from time. Faye's would be delicate, with an evil-looking cover that betrays evil, and so on. But as you delve deeper in the story and therefore each character's secret past, the books become much different: Spike's becomes worn and rough, like Jet's, frayed on the outside, with a hole punched straight through the middle. Jet's would be more worn, yet have a soft spot in the middle. Faye's would have a huge question mark from chapter 1 to somewhere around the middle, then soften into a golden hue. Seems stupid, but I ain't spoiling anything. But honestly, each of these characters deserves his or her own biography; each story, so different from each other, yet they all come back to haunt them in the present. And as each character deals with their ghosts, they must make a tough decision: to let the ghost keep haunting them, or to finally put it all to rest? If you don't like extended analogies, then go watch Cowboy Bebop and skip my review. Time's a wastin'. \
When I think of Cowboy Bebop, I don't think of old, garish, rubbish pictures of grainy animation and slipshod storylines made to fit the mass audience it tries and fails to appeal to. What I see now is a masterpiece that will last the ages - and I should have known better if an anime gets a English adaptation and is shown in America for over a decade it should be pretty freaking good. And I finally digress; if I am not able to convince you to watch the show by now, I have failed as a reviewer because, if anything, this was the best show I've ever watched. I can't say that for anything else, because I'm one of those people that says everything is his favorite show. But this easily trumps all that. See you later, Space Cowboy. \

    \"Well here’s another great moment in the legend of Spike, famous bounty hunter and dog walker.\"\
-Spike Spiegel\
Due to my increasingly robust backlog I rarely take the opportunity to rewatch an anime. For the sake of Cowboy Bebop, one of my few critically acclaimed series, I decided to make an exception. My re-analysis was sparked by a conversation I had recently with a friend, in which she asked me what I loved so much about the series. For some reason, I couldn't rattle off a list or even a few distinct reasons as to why I hold the series in such high regard. This led me\
          \
        to grow curious of my thoughts if I gave it a re-watch. This was my gateway anime, the series that truly drew me to the medium in the first place, and I find it only fair to remove the nostalgia goggles for a bit and give this series a second look. Did it stand the test of time? Is it still a 10 out of 10? Well, there's only one way to find out. I'm reviewing this from a purely critical standpoint so it may get rather lengthy. Minor spoilers ahead.\
Although it debuted in the late 90s, I was first introduced to Bebop about a decade ago, the summer of my junior year in high school (I realize I just dated myself). Up until that time I had always looked at anime as gimmicky or childish, cartoons lacking intellectual plot lines and flooded with girls sporting cat ears, with ultraviolent shock factor. When I had discovered Adult Swim on Cartoon Network, I was ecstatic. I would willingly stay up into the wee hours of the morning powering through shows like Bebop, Outlaw Star and Samurai Champloo, expanding my anime resume and loving every second of it. I think specifically in Bebop's case, the anime is subconsciously praised more for what it accomplished rather than its content. It helped spark a western anime revolution with entertainment fans in Europe and North America, creating a series approved by both avid anime connoisseurs and casual viewers. Not only did Bebop succeed, but it did so without tasteless fan service, harems, bad English voice acting or most anything else Americans commonly complain about in anime. In retrospect, I am so grateful to this series for opening my eyes to the medium and showing me how enjoyable anime can truly be.\
When it comes to plot content, Cowboy Bebop is actually kind of bare-bones. The over-arcing storyline serves more as a backdrop then a focal point of the series. Spike Spiegel, a lethargic space bounty hunter stricken by the grief of losing his lover collects rewards from nabbing various criminals around the galaxy. His partner, Jet Black acts as the perfect balance in personality to Spike, exuding wisdom as well as common sense. They encounter a seemingly insurmountable amount of bad luck, pick up more crewmembers and come to terms with the ghosts of their past. Those ghosts are perhaps stronger for no one other than Spike, who has thoughts of his mistresse's killer looming in the back of his mind, waiting for a final battle with a one time friend spanning the length of the galaxy. Spike even sports a fake eye, a testament to his imperfection.\
Throughout Spike and Jet's escapades in space, Cowboy Bebop explores a plethora of themes including loss, existentialism and loneliness. Each episode ebbs and flows with distinct tonal shifts accompanied by peppy jazz medleys along the way. The editing is quite fluid. I've always enjoyed the way this era of anime (Serial Experiments Lain, Visions of Escaflowne etc.) would create points of pondering or intellectual thought and didn't just slam the subject matter in your face. Although the anime is episodic in nature, this almost works to its advantage, adding snippets of various symbolism in its environment and dialogue. Even more cheeky episodes like the one where the crew discovers psychedelic mushrooms, help to illustrate the boredom one must face in the life of space. There are even moments where characters seem to be intoxicated or having some sort of transcendental experience, crafted almost entirely by the mind's ability to meander basically anywhere. Viewers have the unique ability to witness these themes vicariously through the crew and sympathize with them accordingly. This is definitely a quality of the anime I didn't appreciate the first time I watched it, but now that I'm older I do.\
Another portion that works towards Cowboy Bebop's advantage is the lack of internal monologue with the characters. Instead of overtly telling the viewer what each character is thinking, the writers leave the inferring to our own minds. It's what some critics like to call the \"intelligence test\" with movies and TV alike. Sometimes monologues can detract from a series if not done properly or too often by taking the viewer out of an analytic role. Similar to this is how the entire environment is constructed. Everything feels very matter-of-fact, much like you're just dropping in as a fly on the wall with little or no introduction to the setting. The narrative is never ruined by a character abruptly stopping to explain something, which would be entirely unnecessary based on how well everything is illustrated in Cowboy Bebop. It gives you a warm fuzzy for how real life in futuristic space would be like. Even as the show concluded, with the lead character's fate being in question, there was no long drawnout speech, just the ending scenes for the viewers to decide the overall outcome. Bebop ends up being that show that can either be watched all at once or at a 1 to 2 episode a night speed. It's perfect to enjoy after a long day at school or work or just wanting to relax and enjoy some good quality entertainment.\
In a perfect world an anime would balance intellectual and story driven elements with finesse. Unfortunately, this is one area that Cowboy Bebop suffers. If you don't appreciate the characters or get interested in the symbolism side of things, there isn't much else left to keep the anime afloat. Lucky for me I was able to appreciate the references and themes more this time around, so it didn't putter out or feel boring to me. There were instances where I became distracted, which were annoying, causing me to skip back and there aren't a lot of times where I was glued to my seat with excitement. It's one of those shows where you have to sit back and just take it all in, which isn't necessarily for everyone. The episodic approach offers multiple vignettes where a story is built up and concluded, all in 20 minutes.  This is a difficult task to tackle, which often lead to creating many one-dimensional villains and making me feel quite unattached from their cause, whatever it may have been. The ending also appeared to be more of a plot convenience than a justifiable conclusion.  It's almost as though Shinichiro Watanabe (director) ran out of storyboard and decided to put into place a rather cliche' ending on the series. These negatives stand out like a scratch on a new car, as they prevent the series from truly being a masterpiece. Most people would be apt to forget about these points however, since the general consensus is that Bebop is the pinnacle of Japanese animation.\
The characters and Cowboy Bebop are undoubtedly one of the stronger points of the series. Watanabe did a great job of portraying the characters as relative opposites, in both demeanor and appearance. Spike is clean-cut with a dry personality, while Jet is patriarchal and political with a more rugged attire. Apparently Watanabe originally designed Spike to wear an eye patch, but the producers wrote it off early in development. Honestly, Jet serves as the entire parental unit a board the crew's ship. He's responsible, he cooks and is in charge of overseeing all the major repairs the ship undergoes. Faye, described by her Japanese voice actor as an \"ugly\" woman, does a fantastic job causing trouble and avoiding basically any responsibility for it. However, her enigmatic past makes her rather redeemable as a character and leaves a large area open for interpretation. There really isn't a heavily endowed, brain dead dame in Bebop. Speaking of enigmatic, the androgynous Ed has some mysteries of his own... or should I say \"her\" own. Dopey and unpredictable are just a few words to describe the hacker. Apparently, Ed's personality was crafted based on Yoko Kanno, the notorious composer of Bebop's OST. She must have been one interesting woman. Oddly enough, Watanabe originally proposed Ed as a male, but was gender swapped to even out the sausage fest. And let's not forget the most adorable anime pet in existence, Ein... the laziest/cutest data dog in the galaxy. Each of the characters exhibit some robust skeletons from their past and experience obvious signs of boredom and abandonment along the way. Spike's intriguing involvement with his rival Vicious is fueled by rage and revenge, two qualities not normally promulgated in Spike's personality. At the same time, It's a relationship I feel could've been expanded upon a little more. There are too many anime that falter when giving proper depth to antagonists, and Cowboy Bebop succumbs to the same issue.\
If you hadn't already realized, the music is vital to Cowboy Bebop's storytelling and scene progression. Jazzy, upbeat tunes are juxtaposed with hand to hand combat and perilous situations, but everything seemed to click. Yoko Kanno had worked wonders with Sunrise Animations, and Bebop is quite possibly her magnum opus. It's one of the few anime soundtracks I could listen to standalone, without people questioning what the hell I was listening to.  It truly sounds like tracks out of a movie. Both the English and Japanese voice acting is impeccable, with props given to our lord and savior, Stephen Blum for his portrayal of Spike and Melissa Fahn as Edward. The OP is iconic, with superb, James Bond-like animation and the ED never really aged poorly for me. Overall, many present day anime could learn a thing or two about Bebop's music and how important it is to the series.  Without the soundtrack, this anime would \"ok\" at best. Animation has already been covered briefly, but I reiterate how well the artists created such a vivid depiction of space and the future. The character models were all very unique and their faces were emblazoned with personality.\
Although I still very much appreciate this anime, I didn't enjoy it as much the second time around. Maybe it was half out of expectation or previous involvement, but something didn't feel as interesting to me. Still, I would urge just about any anime fan to check out the series if not already done. If for no other reason than to experience how great this time period was for anime in general, and how it paved the way for the growing industry. Like I previously stated, most people my age hold the series in such high regard due to pure nostalgia or how it opened their eyes to the medium of anime, I know it did for me. It's a series you can sit down and talk about even with non-anime fans, and believe me that's hard to find. I would prefer the series not be remade, as Watanabe suggests, but would be interested in a western, live-action adaptation. I think a successful American release of Ghost In The Shell will open the flood gates for future adaptations. As always, thanks for reading the review and be sure to check out my other works!\

    Title: Cowboy Bebop\
Manga, Anime: Cowboy Bebop has two manga incarnations to its name.  The first, with the same title as the show, is a manga adaptation of the anime, with story by Hajime Yamate and art by Yutaka Nanten, and ran in Kadokawa Shoten's Asuka Fantasy DX magazine from April 1998 to April 2000.  The second, titled Cowboy Bebop: Shooting Star, is a retelling of the anime, done by Cain Kuga, and also ran in Asuka Fantasy DX during 1997.  Both have been licensed Stateside by Tokyopop, and the release date for the third and second and final volumes for both were\
          \
        August 20th, 2002, and June 10th, 2003.\
The anime itself ran for twenty-six episodes, though it originally had a disrupted run on TV Tokyo from April 3rd to June 19th, 1998, before airing in full on a disrupted broadcast schedule on the satellite network WOWOW from October 23rd, 1998 to April 23rd, 1999.  It was produced by Sunrise (famous for their work on Inuyasha and the Gundam series), and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe (famous for his work on Macross Plus and Samurai Champloo).  It was licensed Stateside by Bandai Entertainment, and the box set of the Remix episodes (which was also the version I watched) was released on February 5th of this year (2008).  There is a movie that was released not long after the series ended, which I will cover later in the review.\
Story: It's the year 2071 AD, and mankind has colonized the entire solar system.  Spike Spiegel is a Cowboy (this era's term for bounty hunters) who works with Jet Black to track down bounties and struggle to live off of them.  Along the way, they pick up a few extra people and their pasts are bought to light.\
Cowboy Bebop is, for the most part, a bounty of the week episode, with some minor continuing threads.  All in all, it's done pretty well, with bounties delving into the pasts of characters, and being just interesting in general.  The characters are an interesting bunch of people, with Ed taking the cake as crack in human form.  :P  \
Some will complain that the plot in the last two episodes comes out of nowhere, but they're a bit inaccurate there; the threads have been building up in episodes here and there throughout the show, though they are admittedly a bit scattered.\
Art: The show's a bit dated, obviously.  But, compared to other shows that were airing around that time (Ruroni Kenshin, Beserk), the animation is pretty good.  The designs for characters are very well done, and the designs for the ships and all the backgrounds in particular are amazingly detailed.\
Music: Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts did the work for this soundtrack, and it's absolutely amazing.  There's so much variety in all the variations on jazz and blues that they do for this, and it's amazingly catchy.  This was one of the first soundtracks I actively noticed in a show and tried to find.  \
They also did work on the OP, 'Tank!' (which Baccano! takes a cue from) and ED, 'The Real Folk Blues', both of which are instantly memorable and fit the series quite well.\
Length: I liked sixteen out of the twenty-six total episodes, and the series probably would've done well to keep those episodes in the long run and cut the rest.  Still, all in all, that's a pretty good percentage.\
Seiyuu: Megumi Hayashibara (famous for her roles as Rei Ayanami in Evangelion and Atsuko Chiba and Paprika in Paprika) plays Faye Valentine in this, and Jouji Nakata appears in a minor role.  I admire Ed's seiyuu for being able to capture the sheer crazy of her character.  All in all, a pretty good job.\
Voice Actors: Cowboy Bebop was one of the first anime I watched, back when it was regularly airing on Adult Swim.  When I went back to watch it, I found that, all things considered, the voice actors did a pretty good job with their roles.  The voices weren't quite the same, but, all in all, still fit the characters pretty well.  One of the better dubs I've seen out there.\
Dub: Looking back on the dub, it was one of the better dubs I saw back when I was first getting into anime.  A few lines of dialogue were altered in the English version, and some minor edits were made so that it was able to air on TV, but compared to DiC's butchering of Sailor Moon, it was a pretty good job.  If only they could've all been this good.\
\
Overall: A well-done show, with an episodic plot that delves into it's character's past that sporadically builds to the conclusion, detailed animation, amazing music, and a pretty good dub.  \
Definitely in my top ten shows; a must-watch.\

    I have been putting Cowboy Bebop off for a month or two, watching an episode here, watching an episode there, dropping it, putting it on hold, picking it back up again, etc. It's a little hard to get into considering it is solely character driven from the first episode on, and since you don't even find out...anything...about the characters until the tenth or so episode, there isn't much to work off of in the \"do I or don't I\" character like/attachment department. \
Story-wise, Cowboy Bebop doesn't actually have any past 4, maybe 5, episodes overall. It is episodic, some of the 20 minute plotlines a\
          \
        hit, and others a miss. Some are character-based, some are silly (the fridge will get cleaned out more often now if I have anything to say about it), and some are serious. Once you finally hit the actual \"story\" of Cowboy Bebop near the end, it is amazing how well they managed to set it up and run it so smoothly without much priorly given information. \
It took me until the last day I decided to just sit down and watch the last seven episodes to decide if I just meh liked, or loved, the characters. I've settled into a happy medium. Everyone down to Ein have a sort of apathetic depth that makes them feel all the more real. They have flaws, they have personalities, they work well together. Sometimes it's hard to remember they are fictional because of how naturally they act. \
Overall, Cwboy Bebop delivers enjoyment of  not being a \"this is what we learned today\" anime, but also not a shallow, \"who cares\" anime. It has a level of depth where it gives off a \"this is what's going on and we don't care if you have an issue with it\" feel, something that made it boring, or extra good, depending on my mood. It's a good one to try and see, and it's also a good one to watch over a period of time, and give a couple of chances. It definitely has a bit of everything, from silly to downright creepy, and even if you don't like it as a whole, you will probably find at least one episode that suits your tastes. \

    At its core, Cowboy Bebop is the story of Spike Spiegal, Jets Black, Fay Valentines, Edward, Ion, Vicious, and Julia. But that's where the whole anime, in itself, drives a whole lot more in its 26 episodes. It leads us through a universe somewhere around 2080s space - I'm not sure, because in one episode one of the characters died in 2071 - where we still have the planets of the Milky Way, but because of the presence of orbital gates and space travelling and colonization, all the planets are now in themselves environments with interactive stories to tell. And yes, a lot of stories\
          \
        happen in either the planets (Jupiter, or Mars, or Earth, or Pluto), or their moons (like Titan, for instance).\
For instance, Cowboy Bebop doesn't refer to either Spike or Jet, but rather the spaceship they use which has been named \"Cowboy Bebop\". Now, unless you had seen all the episodes, this small little thing might have been missed out. Its not a spoiler by any means, but it is stated to illustrate how the anime is presented.\
While it is preferred to watch Cowboy Bebop in sequence, the episodes themselves are arranged like vignettes with only the characters forming the core bond holding them together. All of them. In the case of Cowboy Bebop, the best thing are well developed characters, even when they occur for one episode only. They not only interact with their environment (like bounty hunting, or hacking systems, or going to bars to drink, or even casual conversations between non-interactive characters who are very minor, for instance), but even amongst themselves are very... organic.\
While the fight scenes and battle sequences in Cowboy Bebop are limited, they are nevertheless well handled. My personal favourite fight scenes are from the ending moments of \"Hard Luck Woman\". But in terms of personal favourite episodes, I'd choose \"Pierre le Fou\", \"Cowboy Funk\", \"Mushroom Samba\", and \"Heavy Metal Queen\".\
In terms of characters, however, I'll be sadly blunt here, and by saying so I do solemnly want to inform everyone reading this review, that this is a massive spoiler, so be warned: Julia is a bitch. I'll not tell you why, but after seeing Cowboy Bebop, you'll realize this as soon as you reach the arc \"The Real Folk Blues\".\
Cowboy Bebop has its moments of contemplation, and it also has its moments of melancholy as well, but it does its best to integrate these alongside countless other emotions into the universe it is set in. Again, I repeat, the universe Cowboy Bebop is set in, is very dynamic, and in this anime it is very well executed.\
This is a classic by many significant anime standards, and it doesn't come as a surprise why most traditional anime fans tend to bash modern ones. Its a timeless tale, and it is presented well. And it deserves to be recognized.\
All in all, a deserving watch.\

    I'm not one to jump on the hype train. I try to not get high hopes for anything, because usually you are going to be let down. I've heard the praise for this show so many times over the years. Google \"Top Ten Anime Series\" and almost every list will have Bebop in it, usually at #1. So I went in hesitantly, and I've gotta tell you...\
Cowboy Bebop is a goddamn masterpiece.\
Each episode is usually standalone. That right there tends to steer a lot of would-be viewers away from this series. Even I was a bit hesitant to plunge into a show with an episodic\
          \
        structure. But I'll tell you, this show really pulls it off. There are a few episodes that connect together, but for the most part, it's a standalone affair.\
The series follows the bounty hunting crew of the good ship Bebop in the year 2071. It depicts their daily lives as bounty hunters, as well as giving us insight into their pasts. Most episodes or \"sessions\" as they are called, tend to focus on the crew attempting to secure a bounty. This might sound a tad bit repetitive, but I swear it's not. The sheer unpredictability and creativity that is put into each session assures the audience that things will never get boring.\
The strength of the show really isn't in its plot, though. It's the characters that drive the series forward. They are all incredibly well developed, which is an amazing feat due to the episodic nature of the show. Each of the four principle characters are completely different, and they all feel real and authentic. \
Them all being squeezed into one ship creates a brilliant stew of character interaction. Their ideals and viewpoints clash on the regular, which creates some interesting scenes. They also bond over time, even though some of the characters try their best to hide it. \
Their pasts are also heavily explored, as one of the recurring themes throughout the show is that your past will always catch up with you. This applies more to the central character, Spike Spiegel, more than the rest however. Each member of the main cast gets a few episodes specifically focusing on them, adopting a flashback format. These are generally the best episodes of the show, in my opinion.\
I fell in love with these characters, and it was heartbreaking to see them go through so many ordeals. Spike, Jet, Faye, and Ed won't leave your mind for a long time after you finish the show.\
The art and animation are incredibly good for its time. There are some series now that fail to reach Bebop's level of artistic beauty and fluid animation. For example, Trigun, which came out around the same time, is nothing compared to Sunrise's work on Bebop. The art isn't too flashy, but it perfectly creates a realistic space western feel. You feel like this world has been lived in, and things aren't always pretty. The character designs in particular are impressive, as each member of the cast has a different and recognizable look. \
The animation is flawless. Absolutely flawless. This is expertly conveyed in the action scenes, which have a naturalistic and fluid feel to them that is rarely achieved in anime. The only flaw on the art and animation fronts is the computer generated graphics that are used several times during the show. They look out of place and don't really meld well with the environments, but hey, the show came out in 1998! I think I can cut it some slack. Still worth mentioning though.\
The soundtrack is where this show excels at a level I don't think I've ever heard before. The mix of jazz and blues, with a little bit of classic rock thrown in brings the show to life. It fits the mood of the show perfectly, even though it might sound odd for a science fiction show. It works, though, I swear it. As a testament to its greatness, I'm listening to the soundtrack right now, as I write this review. Props to Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts, for real. I mean, \"Space Lion\" is one of the greatest tracks I've ever heard.\
The English dubbing of this show is in a class of its own. It fits the show perfectly, with each cast member giving it their all. I don't know how good the Japanese audio track is, but it's going to be hard to beat this. It's fucking unbelievable. I mean, Steve Blum kills it.\
This show is considered a classic today. I had heard all the praise. Not once did I buy it. I went into this show thinking that it probably wasn't going to live up to its praise. I was wrong. Dead wrong. \
The sophistication of it's themes and characters are unrivaled in anime. The beautiful art and stunning animation. The wonderful soundtrack. The great ending. Oh yes, the ending. It's a stunning conclusion that managed to wow me and break my heart at the same time. This is animation at its finest. \
For reference, here are my top five favorite episodes:\
5. Waltz for Venus/Pierrot Le Fou \
4. Hard Luck Woman\
3. Ballad of Fallen Angels\
2. Jupiter Jazz (Parts I & II)\
1. The Real Folk Blues (Parts I & II)\
See you, space cowboy.\

    \"And the work which has become a genre unto itself shall be called: Cowboy Bebop\" \
^ This sentence was showed several times during the episodes and it is already giving away about the uniqueness Cowboy Bebop carries. There are many unique anime in our anime world, but most of them fail to execute it well. However, fortunately that is not the case with Cowboy Bebop. It is a truly classic anime with incredibly awesome soundtrack and brilliant character development.\
Cowboy Bebop centers around a group of bounty hunters in a futuristic, space-western setting. The year is 2071 and the place is our Solar System, where various\
          \
        planets and moons have been terraformed for human settlement. Bebop is a spaceship where two bounty hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet Black are travelling around the space and hunting down their preys to earn money. Along the way their duo (2) becomes a quintet (5) when the engineered dog Ein, beautiful yet very complicated women Faye Valentine, and computer genius teenage girl Edward (yes a girl) joins their group, or I should say forced themselves in.\
This newly formed bounty hunter group is ridiculously unlucky since the day their duo became a quintet. However, this is exactly what brings the comedy. Their unlucky hunt probably is due to the lack of teamwork and recognition of each other skills. Even though they are all highly skilled in certain areas, they all usually go alone on the job which is what makes the series even more entertaining.\
Yes, the plot is not the main engine of Cowboy Bebop series. Every episode is a new story and rarely has any relevance to the past episodes. Sometimes they are dramatic, sometimes comedic and sometimes very serious. When the episode starts, you simply have no clue what theme and mood this time it will be and will they capture their prey or not, or maybe it will be one of those rare episodes when they follow the main story of Cowboy Bebop? In any case, all episodes are very enjoyable and unpredictable.\
Since the plot is not the main engine, then what exactly makes Cowboy Bebop series so amazing that it is usually listed in most anime top lists? Well that probably is characters and OST. Every one of the main character's have some really harsh past that they do not want to share with anyone at all. It is something they treasure a lot. All of this does not stop them from some really amusing interaction.\
As I mentioned already, they have some really harsh pasts. This \"past\" thing is what gives a lot of room for the character development. Their past is not revealed in one short episode and what is most important - the way their past is revealed. Usually past is revealed by jumping into flashbacks, however that is not the case with Cowbow Bebop. To see how it is done, you will have to watch it yourself, but I can reassure you that their growth as individual and as a team member is definitely executed extremely well and in entertaining way.\
Music is the other major factor why this series is so brilliant. Whole soundtrack is simply superb. This whole jazz music is fitting the story perfectly. I have never seen another anime that could go so perfectly in sync with its soundtrack. The last two episodes is kinda a showdown of the beauty that jazz can actually offer in combination with great story.\
What is really surprising that animation is rather good considering in what year Cowboy Bebop aired. Usually I am very picky on the old anime because I cannot withstand crappy animation and just because of this I avoided Cowboy Bebop too. Well now I can certainly say that either the series were so entertaining that I did not notice animation flaws or the animation was just simply good enough considering it was released in 1998.\
Overall, Cowboy Bebop is in the anime top tier list definitely for a reason. With its great amusing characters, beautiful and very fitting jazz music it also gives many short yet brilliant stories. I am not afraid to use this word to describe Cowboy Bebop at all - MASTERPIECE.\
P.S. I must praise the voice actors who dubbed it amazingly well. I do not know how was the Japanese dubs, but English were great.\

    Overview:\
Today I will look at what is probably the most universally well received anime by non-otaku and casual viewers. It is well known that \"film snobs\" don't have the same taste as average film goers. A film snob will say Citizen Kane or Tokyo Story is the best movie of all time whereas an average viewer will generally choose something like The Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption. With anime it is the same way. If Legend of the Galactic Heroes is the Citizen Kane of anime revered by all the elitist snobs, and all those people making a pathetic attempt to \"prove\" that they are\
          \
        intellectuals, than Cowboy Bebop is The Godfather of anime. It is THE anime of the common man.\
Story: 8/10\
Cowboy Bebop is largely episodic and many episodes stand alone, but it does have an overall plot that moves forward. The story takes place in a future where warp gates have made rapid travel between the planets easy and most of the solar system has been terraformed and colonized. However, a hypergate above Earth exploded and badly damaged the moon. This caused large chunks of moon to bombard Earth and devastate much of the human population, so few humans remain on our original home world. Our main protagonist is a bounty hunter named Spike Spiegel (extremely Jewish last name) who is visually modeled on the body of Lupin the 3rd with Bob Dylan's hair and face. You know, because Shinichi Watanabe is an insane person. Spike's partner is an ex-cop and jazz enthusiast named Jet Black, who is a white man obviously voiced by a black man. You know...because Watanabe is an insane person. On their many adventures they meet a Taiwanese scam artist who claims to be a Gypsy, a genetically modified Welsh Corgi, and an androgenous, genius computer hacker. The crew of the Bebop will take on any job no matter how dangerous, but something always seems to go wrong and they never get paid very much for all their efforts. We also find out that Spike once worked for a major crime syndicate and has a tragic past love with a woman named Julia and unfinished business with a vicious mobster simply named...Vicious.\
Characters: 10/10\
Cowboy Bebop has an absolutely amazing cast of characters. Spike is one of the most beloved protagonists in all of anime. He is a master bounty hunter and the baddest Jew in space! Jet's humor is a bit more dry than other characters like Edward, but now that I'm older I find myself liking Jet quite a bit. Faye is a voluptuous femme fatale that is quite amusing throughout the series with her schemes and antics, and Ed is...just Ed. With the red hair, gender ambiguity, obvious Asperger's, and being the world's greatest computer hacker and Chess Player, Ed shares a surprising number of traits with Lisbeth Salender of the Millenium Trilogy. Maybe Ed gave birth to Lisbeth after an affair with the short tempered and perpetually snarky Hiei from Yu Yu Hakusho? That would pretty much explain Lisbeth to a T. Anyways, the last character is the deliciously over the top villain simply known as Vicious. He wears a trench coat over a black military uniform, fights with a katana against opponents with guns, and always has an evil raven perched on his shoulder. What a fucking badass! When Vicious isn't carving motherfuckers up with his katana, he is smiling psychotically and scheming some devious master plan to screw yet another person over. Gotta love Vicious.\
Sound: 10/10\
This is by far the best Jazz soundtrack in all of anime, and perhaps the best soundtrack period. I personally like the Rurouni Kenshin/Samurai X soundtrack, but Cowboy Bebop is easily my #2. Even if you think you don't like Jazz, you will love this soundtrack. It's virtually impossible not to.\
Art: 8/10\
The art is somewhat dated since this show was made in the 1990s, but still holds up pretty well. It is animated a LOT less lazily than DBZ, Yu Yu Hakusho, Sailor Moon, and most other 90s anime. The character designs are interestingly enough largely based on Lupin the 3rd with Spike being given Lupin's lanky body, Jet has Jigen's beard, and Vicious has Goemon's hair and face. This was a fun and clever homage by the animators to a 1970s classic.\
Enjoyment: 10/10\
I rated it a 10 because it won't let me pull a Spinal Tap and give it that extra little oomph up to 11! This series has plane dogfights, epic shootout scenes, fist fights, swordplay, and any kind of action you can think of. The series also homages many classic movies and genres depending on what planet the crew visits. Hell, there is even a blaxploitation film tribute episode!\
Overall: 10/10\
Cowboy Bebop is not my personal #1 anime of all time, but it is definitely in my top 10. Even though there are series that are closer to my heart on a personal level, Bebop is probably the most flawless anime I have ever seen. There is literally nothing to hate about this series. The art, storytelling, characters, music, and direction are all so well done that I can't imagine anyone saying that this sucks! I am emotionally attached to a few series above Bebop, but I recognize that those series have some flaws and see why others might mock and ridicule them. To use a baseball analogy, Cowboy Bebop doesn't quite swing for the fences in that same way where it will either be a grand slam or a strike out. Bebop is that perfect line drive that may not knock it out of the park for you, but it will definitely connect and be a respectable hit! If you are new to anime or if you are under the age of 20 and have simply never seen this slightly older series, you should check it out!\

    I had the chance to watch Cowboy Bebop before. Why didn’t I watch it?\
After watching Cowboy Bebop, it was as if I went through an otaku ritual. I believe that every otaku out there should watch Cowboy Bebop – at least once in their lives – and realize how anime should be done.\
The story-telling, the dialogue, the feel, the emotions. Everything was just mixed right. Every episode was unique and almost perfect. Every episode started and ended in a way you didn’t expect. My personal favorite, was Session 20, Pierrot le Fou. That episode sent chills down my spine. I won’t tell why, just so\
          \
        anyone who reads this review would feel obligated to watch Cowboy Bebop in its entirety. Session 23 was not bad either; I love the intellectual conversations about who God is throughout the episode.\
The characters made this anime. I loved every single one of them (including the supporting characters) and their individual quirks. My favorite was Spike Spiegel, of course. I love it whenever he did jeet kune do, the martial arts system that was developed by Bruce Lee. It was just exciting to watch him fight. Jet Black was just as cool as Spike. I am fascinated at his bounty hunter skills, as well as his past. Any man with a past is automatically cool. I didn’t like Faye Valentine at first, mostly because of her voice, but after you get to know more about her (the anime will reveal her past), you’ll realize that she’s one strong woman. Finally, there’s Ed. She (It’s not a typo) is one wacky kid and surprisingly adorable.\
The voice acting really contributed to the characters personalities. Spike, without Kouichi Yamadera’s voice, would never be as cool as he is with him. Jet’s past would almost seep through Unshou Ishizuka’s voice. I already said that Faye’s voice, more specifically Megumi Hayashibara’s voice irritated me in the beginning, but she really brought out Faye’s personality. Aoi Tada’s voice made Ed even cuter. I also have to note that the banter and random discourse between these four are absolutely entertaining.\
Shinichiro Watanabe played a huge role in making Cowboy Bebop visually appealing. Watching the series was just so easy on the eyes – the scenes weren’t heavy or overloaded at all. The scenes went on smoothly, and each scene was lovely to look at. The colors were great, and the backgrounds were detailed enough. However, I did not like the 3D animation all too much cause I found it a bit too rough, but considering it was made in 1998, I guess it wasn’t that bad.\
Yoko Kanno was another factor that made me love this anime so much. She is one musical genius, and I love her work on Cowboy Bebop. I think there were new tracks for every episode, and each one complimented the scenes beautifully. Each one was different too – Tank! And The Real Folk Blues were jazzy and bluesy, but there were pop, classic, whatever tracks throughout the series too. While Shinichiro Watanabe was telling a story through sight, Yoko Kanno was doing the same through sound.\
Truth be told, I wasn’t enthusiastic in watching Cowboy Bebop in the beginning. That’s because I’m not really into sci-fi themes, but Cowboy Bebop was different. The thing I like about it the most is that it’s charisma transcends through time. In three words, it’s a classic.",

    *SPOILERS FOR COWBOY BEBOP IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY SEEN IT SOMEHOW*\
I'm sure that I'll hardly be able to add anything new here given that most of this show's praises have been sung more than the OST has been replayed by anyone who has seen the show, but what the hell? If Spike could go up against a Syndicate, then I can still find some things to say, at least presumably. Back to the preamble and enough of the rambling. Back in 1998, this wand the most popular show. Anime was just starting to really hit a boom with the US market, and back in the\
          \
        day, this was like, the show you'd always sneak out to your friend's house or purposefully break your 9:30 PM curfew to watch if you were a kid in middle-school. Nowadays, it's one of the most celebrated anime to date, with thousands upon thousands of loyal fans who always spread the series like a loud bang from a gun in a giant echoing hallway with people in it who somehow rejoice the sound (if you get the inside joke I made). Now why is that? What makes this series stand out as one of the few classic anime (10+ years old defines a classic if it's often considered great) to make it to the top 30, among the likes of Code Geass, GTO, Spirited Away, and Legend of the Galactic Heroes? What makes this to often be considered Shinichiro Watanabe's magnum opus? Well, let's find out, shall we?\
STORY: 10/10\
A large chunk of this series is set on individual missions for the Bebop crew to try and make some money off of, usually to fail due to unforeseen circumstances, like their bounty dying, or someone screwing everything over for them, or whatnot, and a lot of them are fairly episodic. Sure, a lot of them are used to flesh out bits and pieces of the Bebop crew in sometimes tragic ways, but there are just there to fill up the run time, at least that's what it feels like. The ultimate plot behind it is that Spike Spiegel was once part of the Red Dragon Syndicate, but after Julia starts falling in love with Spike, Vicious loves up to his name and takes everything over and chases after Spike, so in order to escape, he fakes his death and joins up with former cop, Jet, and together, become bounty hunters, or Cowboys, if you will. After some missions gone awry, a dog, a troubled gambler who was in cryostasis for 70 or so years, and a genius hacker who is also a little girl, all join the crew, to Spike's initial dismay. Before I dive into the real meat of what makes the narrative of the show so special, I have to call attention to their taste in music and culture as a whole, with each title being a reference to a song or even a style or genre of music, as well as episodes that are blatant references to certain types of film, like Mushroom Samba's blacksplotation or the city noir crime detective style of Ganymede Elegy. It's always fun to see a show's episode titles have that much care and style put into them, especially when there are series out there that put no goddamn effort into their episode titles at all.\
This series does a great job fleshing out the characters piece by piece, revealing how tragic their back stories are, like those of Jet up until his individual episode in episode 10 and Faye until hers in episode 18 with the video tape from her childhood, which has to be one of the saddest moments in the show. This series also likes to convey emotion more than anything else, specifically the various emotions you experience through life, without resorting to melodrama, which is rather refreshing for a show that relies mostly on pathos, with scenarios like the bell peppers and beef scenes surrounding a tragic case in the first episode, as to signify that this is the crew's way of trying to let it not get to them as they live another day scraping by; eating while trying to put everything past them in order to not be miserable, even after the crew splits temporarily in episode 23. Episodes 12 and 13 are where things start taking a turn for the darker, as after another square off with Vicious, we start truly learning of how badly everyone has it, except arguably for Ed. Admittedly, we already got to see it with Jet a few episodes prior, but that's 1 out of 3. The first time we really get to see the overarching narrative for Spike is in episode 5, and this is sort of taking a back seat for more adventures and scenarios that flesh out everyone. In episode 24, we finally meet Julia, and this is the point where everything comes spiraling down, as in the last 3 episodes, the crew eventually splits for real, Spike meets Julia again, Vicious truly takes control of the syndicate by force, Julia is killed, and Spike storms the syndicate to face off with Vicious once and for all before dying by saying us catchphrase to the cops that surrounded the building, culminating in one of the best ending in anime akin to the likes of Gurren Lagann, and again, Code Geass. \"You're gonna carry that weight\" has been ingrained in the minds of just about everyone who has seen this show since, like the characters, we gotta live with our life choices as some of them come back to haunt us, a message that's infinitely more poignant for adults as they've already started coping with this.\
CHARACTERS: 9/10\
The Bebop crew is widely considered to be one of the most iconic main casts in anime history, and for damn good reason, from their lavishly executed backstories, to their charismatic nature. The man who embodies this most of all is of course, Spike Spiegal, a total badass who hates kids, pets, and women with annoying attitudes. He kicks ass with style and smoothness akin to Bruce Lee (even paraphrasing him and having a similar fighting style), and generally comes off as someone you wanna see in just about any scenario life can bring, which this show is always more than happy to oblige. He has this sort of charisma ther just gels with his combat. It sucks that his past sucks, but that's a key part of the show; that your past will always come back to haunt you until you put it to rest. Jet Black is a former cop who cooks bell peppers and \"beef\" (cuz there is none), and is a very stern man who hates it when Spike goes off on his own, because it often screws with the mission, and with the money. It's always fun to see the two interact, and in fact, it's always fun to see him interact angrily with anyone, and that's surprisingly hard to get right. Then again, this is Cowboy Bebop.\
Faye Valentine is a gambler with an attitude, and a charming mistress who was in stasis for 70 years, uses gambling to wash it all away after the pain of being deceived by a man she was growing affection for in this new, advanced, and alien age. I think what really makes her the most depressing of it was is seeing what an adorable child she was and not only how much everything about her childhood home and friends have changed and disappeared, but just how much darker and more scheming she became. Ed is a hacker who, unsurprisingly, acts like a child, and even plays with the dog named Ein, since of course, he is one. All of them are really likable characters for different reasons, even of most other characters don't have enough screen time for us to really connect with them, especially when some of them die. Though, that's kind of the point. We see the crew having small interactions with these guys we'll rarely see again. Just like the crew, we're just people wandering into the tail end of their now tragic life stories, with one exception: Vicious. A renegade syndicate member who wants revenge and control, feeling betrayed by Julia's affair with his best friend Spike. A typical setup for the hellish rivalry between two friends. Overall, this still quite a lovely cast, especially the awesome and emotionally broken Bebop crew. If they didn't have such bad luck with cases, I'd bet lots of us would wanna join them.\
ART: 10/10\
Some of you may be (unjustly) disconcerted by how old and classic the artstyle is, but this is one of the most fluidly animated shows I've ever seen, surpassing the likes of FLCL, and for it to keep that up for 26 episodes, two whole seasons of anime, is damn impressive. The mid 80's to late 90's perfected anime shading, and this was one of the lucky series to recieve such treatment, especially when it comes to the small ship Spike often pilots. Hell, it looks more polished than most anime today, and it's been nearly 2 decades since this show aired. The show's rendition of the clsssic visual technique of Itano Circus (coined and originated by the legendary Macross franchise since its original installment), shown off in episode 4, is a sight to behold, as are the amazingly fluid fight scenes. Then again, considering how fluid Spike's Bruce Lee inspired fluid fighting style, it's only natural that the series would go that far. The character designs also look both impressively stylish as well as realistic, the latter of which is something you don't often see in anime. The OP in particular as this type of jazzy flare to the art that you'd never see in any other OP, and the ED has blue images, complementing the song's name. The explosions and action look very gritty, really nailing the impact of whenever someone chucks a gernade in the middle of a fight, and overall, this show is definitely worth watching for the crisp and fluid visuals alone.\
SOUND: 9/10\
The soundtrack was done my Yoko Kanno, and that just sells the show right there, doesn't it? A lot of the OST, while not inherently memorable, definitely captured whatever scenario the crew finds itself in during any given episode. Plus, with emotional songs like \"Green Bird\", \"Stella no Moor\", \"Memory\", Waltz for Zizu\" (hey, Digibro used it emotionally), and \"Good night Julia\", how can you go wrong? The OP, \"Tank\" done by The Seatbelts, is a very cool and slick jazz song that amps you up for the show perfectly. You might find it contradictory that I said a lot of tracks aren't that memorable, only to list a lot of really amazing tracks, but there are so many pieces in the show that for even a decent fraction if the OST to be amazing, is to show how amazing it is as a whole. The ED on its own is pretty good, but the moment your tears truly fall is when you hear the full version of the ED \"The Real Folk Blues\" by The Seatbelts FT. Mai Yamane, which is a beautifully done emotional song with a final 2 minutes they can release the feels epically. \
The dub is often heralded as one of the best of all time, and I can't really disagree. It's up there with the likes of Gurren Lagann in terms of dub, which is really fitting given how amazing both shows are. All of the voices sound truly real, more so than most dubs or most performances of any show, and it all gels really well. Steve Blum does Spike Spiegel, and if you're a straight girl, you probably felt pleasure from that fact alone given this man's voice. Everyone else does a really great job as well, and rarely does it fell awkward in the slightest. \
ENJOYMENT: 8/10\
Like I said, some of the middle episodes were almost fillery, and a bit boring (namely Mushroom Samba) but it was all worth it, not just for every episode that revealed much of any character's past, but also for the final few episodes. The show is smooth, and slick, like a good jazz song, and it often carried me through some of the weaker moments, followed by some really strong emotional moments. The show is definitely an entertaining one, and the badass yet tragic finale was definitely the highlight of everything. Looking back on and/or rewatching the show is when you truly appreciate the show's brilliance, and I wouldn't mind rewatching it sometime in the future.\
OVERALL: 9/10    RAW SCORE: 92/10\
This is definitely an impressive show that Watanabe worked on. It may not be a personal favorite, but I can easily see why someone would list it as one of theirs. It does a great job presenting the many different emotions of life, and does it brilliantly. Definitely a worthy show for anyone, especially one who loves to experience sci-fi. If you watch this show, you're gonna carry the weight, just like the rest of us. With all that said, I bid you adieu.\

    Introduction:\
On October 24th, 1998, Cowboy Bebop started its first full airing in Japan, it ended the next year on April 24th. It was later broadcasted in the United States as the first anime to ever appear on Adult Swim, and it still is broadcasted on a loop to this day. Now, as many of you probably know Cowboy Bebop is definitely a very popular anime, and it's no wonder it's still broadcasting today, even after most anime have left Adult Swim. Why is so popular though? Well the answer is simple, Cowboy Bebop is a very finely crafted, almost perfect creation that deserves every bit\
          \
        of popularity it gets. With that said, let's get started with the review.\
Actual Review:\
Let's start with a plot summary, Cowboy Bebop, follows a group of bounty hunters in the distant future who have various missions and members focused on each episode. There's Spike Spiegel, a cool and rowdy man who can fight very well, with a mysterious past to boot. Next, there's Jet, the founder of the Bebop crew and a former ISSP Officer, or a police officer if you prefer, with a missing arm and is the intelligence of the group. Then we have the lovely lady, Fei Valentine, a gambling, trouble making woman who has a mysterious problem. Lastly there's Edward, she's the crazy hacker from Earth who is the comic relief for a lot of the show, we will get to how that's a problem later.\
Now that's pretty much it for the plot, that may not seem like much, but it is a lot bigger in execution. Like in my previous review Samurai Champloo, the plot doesn't really have much of an overarching story, it's mostly vignettes and character pieces that delve deeper into the cast or are just fun adventures to watch. Unlike Samurai Champloo however, these vignettes do actually develop the characters and have some interesting themes or surprises in them. Some make you think, others make you laugh, Cowboy Bebop really just has a very large range of tone. This is probably one of the show's greatest strengths, it really knows how to use its characters and setting, it also takes them seriously allowing for a greater sense of immersion.\
This is of course all thanks to the direction and writing. This was Shinichiro Watanabe's first full director job and what a great job he did. Not to mention the gorgeous cinematography and use of lighting in the whole thing. There is rarely a sour beat in the whole show with only a few episodes being mediocre. Of course this is also because of the shows head writer Keiko Nobumoto, who has written other amazing anime such as  Wolf's Rain and Macross Plus. With shows like that under his belt it's no wonder the show turned out to have some very witty and engaging dialogue, filled with great character interactions and being able to create any emotion it desires.\
There's also the gorgeous music, which was done by the stellar composer and goddess of all amazing anime music, Yoko Kanno. The soundtrack can range from passionate jazz to quiet ambience of instruments. There's also the scene near the end of Episode 5, Ballad of Fallen Angels, where they combine amazing visuals and great music to make you go into an orgasmic bliss. Really it's some stellar work by an already amazing artist.\
Speaking of which both the openings and endings of the shows are also great. Tank!, which was also done by Kanno, is the opening for every single episode and get's me pumped to watch the show every time I see it. Not to mention it's hard not to tap your foot along to, it's probably one of the best openings ever conceived. The ending however, is a very passionate and beautiful ballad called, the Real Folk Blues. This ending while not my favorite is very good with a great vocals and visuals of Spike's past giving you a small glimpse of his character.\
With that said and done, the animation is also gorgeous. This show was produced by Sunrise and if you don't know much about their studio, they have produced shows such as Gundam and Escaflowne, which also looked great. Cowboy Bebop also was one of the last shows to be hand drawn, instead of being animated digital technology used today. However, it's just as fluid if not better than a lot of shows that come out today. Also fun fact: while this show was technically made by Sunrise, most of the staff who worked on it later moved on to make Studio Bones who's first project was the Cowboy Bebop movie. So make take that as you may.\
Then there's the world famous dub, which is even makes dub haters say, \"If I watch a dub, it's Cowboy Bebop.\" Every character has the right voice and it, unlike many anime at the time, takes itself seriously enough to make it seem realistic. Steven Blum is amazing a Spike, Beau Billingslea gives Jet the right amount of grumpiness and reason, Wendee Lee gives an amazing performance as the arrogant Fei, and Melissa Fahn gives the right amount on insanity and smartness to the character of Edward. Not to mention all the side characters have great casting to, which I don't think even happened with the best dubs back then. There are very few, if any, stumbles in this dub and it has become an example of what all dubs should strive for.\
So with all of these good things said about the show, does it have any problems? Well there are a few, but they are very minor so get prepared for some nitpicking. First off, Edward is kind of destroys the tone of some episodes. Now I'm ok with comic relief characters, really I am, but that's really one of Ed's only purposes. She is probably the least developed of the cast and while she does get a backstory, overall, she just kind of ruins some parts of the show. Not to say she like makes a whole episode of the show complete crap, that never happens, but she can seem just a little out of place in some of the shows 26 episodes. Really though, that's the shows biggest problem, besides that the other problems are mostly just extremely minor and won't ruin your overall enjoyment.\
Verdict:\
Really, there isn't much to say about Cowboy Bebop because really it's almost completely without flaw. There's no need to explain what's good about it because if there's something you don't like, there will probably be something you will like. There is nothing else I can say besides go see it, Bebop really deserves all the popularity and attention it gets. Before I go I'd also like to mention the Cowboy Bebop Movie, which is a basically just an episode of the show, but much longer and with equally great writing. I recommend that you watch it after you finish the series. Also this show was distributed by Bandai Entertainment, though there apparently going out of business, so you should probably get a copy before the show becomes really expensive. Then again, I doubt this show will stay unlicensed for long after Bandai's demise... So in the end, go see Bebop, you have nothing to lose except free time.\

    Let be the one that forces down the hammer of judgment on this Anime, because honestly it is one of the Anime (and i rarely do this) that i really do not advise you to watch, if you are the one the feels attached to the characters throughout the story-line (i hope you get me on that one).\
First of all i should say that in the animation, sound fields the Anime did pretty well considering the date in which the Anime was Aired. However i should say that the story-line failed miserably. It is rare for a 26 episodes Anime, to not have develop an\

        escalating intensity of events as the story goes on, yet Cowboy Bebop demonstrated the utmost failure a writer could achieve. At the beginning of the story till before the last two episodes the story would be running in a direction(really boring direction), however, and i do not know why, in the last two it goes in a totally different direction totally irrelevant to what you have seen in the first 24 episodes. The Characters also fail, in result of the writer unable to decide what he wants to show out of them. Again i really do not know why they expect people to applaud to the ending. They wanted to make the ending look epic, i seriously thought that in the end it will be all like a dream a Character is having, i was shocked when it ended. \

    If you've been a fan of anime for any length of time, chances are that you've come across a bunch of shows that people hail as nothing short of masterpieces such as Neon Genesis Evangelion. Now, whether or not those programmes are perfection is entirely up to interpretation but if there's one programme which has been lauded as as nothing short of a masterpiece ever since its creation, it's Cowboy Bebop. Such a lofty title is not without those who question it, and indeed there are people who happen to dislike Bebop for a variety of reasons. I personally don't think that Bebop is a\
          \
        masterpiece (and I do consider it to be overrated), but I do see where the praise comes from. In fact, I do believe that Bebop deserves most (but not all) of the praise that it gets. Let's go into great lengths to find out why.\
When it comes down to the actual story, it's rather disheartening to say that Bebop is lacking. The actual \"plot\" of the show is easily resolved within 4-5 episodes despite being 26 episodes long, so it might seem like there is a lot of filler. That's not really the case whatsoever, since Cowboy Bebop opts for a mostly episodic approach. With the exception of the 4-5 episodes where the plot moves forward, this is a show that you can jump into from virtually any point and wouldn't really get lost, provided you're familiar with the basic concept and the characters. In that regard, Cowboy Bebop may very well be considered analogous to something like Batman: The Animated Series in terms of both style and approach.\
Unfortunately, Cowboy Bebop is prone to the same problems that episodic shows of its nature tend to have. If you don't know what I'm talking about, allow me to fill you in. While episodic programmes are easy to get into if you're a complete newcomer to a particular show, the quality of each episode tends to vary quite a bit. Some episodes are absolutely amazing while other episodes are rather tedious to get through. There's also the matter of certain episodes being a bit formulaic in approach. For example, you'd think that a crew of bounty hunters would at least catch a break every now and then but that's not the case at all. No matter what the situation, it's like the Bebop crew would always be down on their luck despite how skilled each member of the team is.\
These might seem like relatively minor problems for a show that has a LOT of merits to stand on, but people often forget that this show is hailed as nothing short of a masterpiece. All it really takes is one relatively mediocre episode for someone with absolutely no prior knowledge of Cowboy Bebop to get a sour impression of this programme. So how would you remedy this? Obviously, you'd watch the episodes in chronological order, right? Uh... not exactly. The first four episodes aren't bad in the slightest, I fucking LOVE them as a matter of fact. But those first four episodes might not be the best introduction to a show lauded as much as Bebop is. If you really want my honest recommendation as to how you should view this programme, I'd say start out with Episode 5 just to get your general impression of the programme. If you like what you see, watch the first four episodes next and then keep watching in chronological order. The reason why you should watch it in that order if you're completely new to Bebop is simple: Episode 5 is a spectacular episode which contains virtually everything that this show is known for so if you don't like Episode 5, Bebop is most likely not going to be your cup of tea and if that's the case, watch Samurai Champloo instead.\
With all that ranting out of the way, let's talk characters. The biggest strength that Bebop has when it comes down to its characters is the fact that they're played straight. This might not seem like such an accomplishment, but keep in mind that characters meant to be overacted were more or less the norm back in the 80s/90s so for its time, this was a rather huge deal. Another thing that Bebop's lead cast all share (for better or worse) are dark pasts that with the exception of Faye, they all try to avoid confronting. Why is this a good and a bad thing? On the one hand, a dark past that slowly gets revealed throughout the course of the programme makes for some awesome plot twists and they are given a fair amount of foreshadowing so the reveal doesn't come off as an asspull. HOWEVER... the concept of a ragtag bunch of misfits with each member having a dark past is a trope which has become rather commonplace in anime/manga over the course of recent years so chances are that some might find it rather cliché which brings me to another point.\
While the leading cast of Bebop certainly does a good job of carrying the story without feeling like cardboard cut-outs a good majority of the time, the fact still remains that they all fall under common archetypes and it gets a little too obvious at times. If you've ever watched a little programme called \"Lupin III.\" you'll be quick to notice that Spike Spiegel bears somewhat of a resemblance to the much beloved Arsene Lupin III with a sense of humour to match (although nowhere near as exaggerated). For that matter, I guess you can say that Jet and Faye are more realistic versions of Daisuke and Fujiko if you want to keep making the comparisons (Jet/Daisuke being the voice of reason and Faye/Fujiko being the \"femme fatale\" so-to-speak). To be fair, I understand that Lupin III was one of the influences behind Bebop's creation. At the same time, I saw Lupin WAAAAY before I ever watched Bebop so the resemblance is rather uncanny to me. With that said, it's still nice to see an interpretation of Lupin, Daisuke, and Fujiko being played straight.\
It's not like they remain static throughout the entire ordeal. With the exception of Edward who's more or less just the quirky and hyperactive computer genius (that still gets a bit of time in the sun regardless), everyone gets a fair amount of development and time on-screen so they're more than just the common archetypes like I've mentioned earlier and in some cases, actually feel like real people rather than you know... characters. With that said, let's talk about secondary/tertiary characters. A good chunk of the episodes introduce a new character whom the Bebop crew ends up dealing with for 20 minutes before their story is resolved by the end of the episode and they are quickly forgotten about. I suppose in that respect, Cowboy Bebop is similar to Mushishi. \
Unlike Mushishi however, Bebop actually does have recurring characters and they do what they do rather well without becoming a distraction. Of course, that still doesn't change the fact that I consider most of them to be like the cabbage merchant from Avatar: The Last Airbender. The standalone characters in Cowboy Bebop on the other hand are hit-and-miss for me. This goes back to the problem that most episodic shows tend to have with varying degrees in quality. Sometimes, I got REALLY attached to the character(s) introduced in one episode and was disheartened to never see them again and other times, the character(s) introduced in another episode were so dull to the point where I felt like the episode was dragging on. \
When it comes down to substance, Bebop falls a little flat so you may be wondering why you should even bother watching it if it's not the epitome of perfection. The answer is very simple: Cowboy Bebop is among the most influential anime of the 90s and its influence can still be seen to this day. In its heyday, Cowboy Bebop achieved a lot of success due to various factors. From its Space Western setting to the well-choreographed action sequences, a soundtrack composed by Yoko Kanno consisting of mostly Jazz and Blues tracks to an amazing English dub where everything was played straight and was allowed to air uncut due to the fact that it was the first anime series that [adult swim] picked up (coincidentally on the same night the network made its debut), it seemed like the odds were stacked in Bebop's favour from the very beginning. Let's not forget the aesthetics because it would be a travesty not to do so. \
For one thing, this is the best-looking TV show from the 90s without a doubt, and to this day it still looks amazing. It's one thing for digital animation to be fluid, but to see that same sort of fluidity with cel animation where each frame was drawn by hand without losing any sort of detail whatsoever really just shows the meticulous amount of time and effort the blokes over at Sunrise put into the art and animation. That's actually kind of funny (in an ironic sort of manner) given that Sunrise was kicked off the animation team for Batman: The Animated Series because of the fact that nearly all the episodes that Sunrise took a part in had to be redone multiple times (or even re-animated in America) because of the fact that virtually everything was off model. I'm guessing that they were basically looking for a way to get back at Bruce Timm and Paul Dini for kicking them off the animation team, so they decided to basically bring out their A-game to their next project which just so happened to be Cowboy Bebop.\
Going back to the soundtrack, what I love most about it (aside from the fact that it was composed by Yoko Kanno) is the fact that the OST isn't an afterthought of any kind since there are multiple scenes throughout the show which forgoes dialogue completely and instead rely on the music to actually convey the moment. It's the little things like this that make it so much more difficult for me to pick who's my favourite composer since the only other composer I can think of who'd actually do such a thing would be Kenji Kawai given that there were similar moments in the Ghost in the Shell films. What's more is the fact that a combination of jazz and blues among other such genres really helped give this show a unique flavour which has yet to be mimicked. Say what you will about Samurai Champloo being a carbon copy of Bebop when it comes down to story/characters, but one thing's for certain: Bebop's style is something that Champloo just cannot imitate (and that's a good thing, since Champloo's got its own style which works amazingly well for it).\
Another thing that Cowboy Bebop has going for it? An absolutely spectacular English dub which is so good to the point where dub haters generally make an exception for this show. This goes back to how everything was played straight in Bebop from the get-go. In the past, English dubs of anime varied quite a bit in quality. Some dubs like the DiC dub of Sailor Moon changed up the dialogue so heavily edited for content and censored to high heaven to the point where it makes 4Kids' One Piece dub blush. Other times, dubs were actually pretty damn good (such was the case with Neon Genesis Evangelion and Yu Yu Hakusho) but were unfortunately butchered when they aired abroad due to the fact that those shows were airing on children's programming blocks and standards back then were much tighter than they are now. That was never the case with Bebop since it was aired on an adult programming block and as such, it was able to forgo most (if not all) of the censorship regulations during its broadcast on [adult swim]. Aside from that, we also had wonderful voice actors working on this like Steve Blum, Wendee Lee, and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn (fun fact: McGlynn also directed the English dub of Bebop) and a slew of many others, all of whom gave excellent performances.\
Aside from the visuals and the audio, what other merits does Bebop have? Well for one thing, its style is something that allowed it to achieve widespread success with Western audiences. It's impossible not to notice that a good majority of anime these days require you to have some pre-existing knowledge of Asian culture in order to properly understand what's going on. Haven't you ever wondered why films like Akira and Ghost in the Shell (and to a lesser degree, Studio Ghibli movies) were huge hits back in the day? It was mostly because these were films that nobody needed any knowledge of Japanese culture to enjoy. Yes, Akira and Ghost in the Shell both took place in Tokyo, but it was really the the concepts, the gloomy atmosphere, the action, the blood, etc. which drew in Western audiences. It was taking place in Japan, and yet it didn't really feel like Japan at all outside of naming conventions, but that's a minor detail in comparison to everything else. It helps that unlike the former two, Bebop actually had virtually all the signs, posters and such in-universe written in English rather than Japanese in the original dub. Don't even get me started on the subtle cultural references and its film noir overtones because if I did, you'd be here for hours reading this review.\
So when you combine all these things together, it's no secret as to why Cowboy Bebop is as lauded as it is now. I can certainly see why it wouldn't really be everyone's cup of tea (especially given some of the flaws I mentioned earlier). Regardless, its influence can't be denied. For all its worth, Cowboy Bebop is certainly a show that deserves most (but not all) the praise it gets. I get the feeling that if it had more of a plot to it and didn't rely so much on being badass and awesome to make people forgive its lack of a plot, it would definitely receive more praise than it already gets. The stage was set perfectly, so I question why Wantanabe and the rest of the Bebop team decided to opt for a mostly episodic nature when the ones where the \"plot\" actually progresses were nothing short of spectacular. Oh well, I guess it's too late to find out why... unless Wantanabe decides to do to Bebop what George Lucas did to Star Wars. Thankfully, Wantanabe seems to have more integrity than that.\
Anyway, that's it for my first review on this site. Please be gentle, senpai.... (>/////\

    Cowboy Bebop... widely considered as a masterpiece. I personally thought it was good, but I would have trouble placing it at masterpiece status.\
I decided to watch Cowboy Bebop because it was done by Shinichiro Watanabe, who also did Samurai Champloo, which is one of my all time favorites. If you watched Champloo, Bebop is similar in that both follow an episodic format, where there is some kind of a story or plot, but the story itself is not as important as the journey. In Champloo, this was the search for the sunflower samurai. I guess in Bebop the main plot focus could be considered Spikes\
          \
        backstory and the whole situation with Julia.\
Cowboy Bebop is about bounty hunters Spike and Jet and there adventures as bounty hunters and the other bounty hunters, Faye and Edward who they meet along their journey.\
Story 8/10\
Art 8/10\
Sound 8/10\
Characters 9/10\
I think the most interesting part of Cowboy Bebop is I guess the main protagonist, Spike Spiegel. Although I do not necessarily the episodic format to be a bad thing, I feel that it sometimes took away what was the most interesting part of the show, which for me was Spike's backstory. Spike is a very interesting character - he is very mysterious, not to mention that he is very skilled at his job.\
Enjoyment 8/10\
Overall 8/10\
Had some moments which where interesting/entertaining, however I have trouble recommending Cowboy Bebop as a masterpiece as some people do. Still a show worth watching if you enjoy the genre.\

    This is the best anime ever made.\
Why?\
Because it isn't anime.\
There aren't any anime conventions in it. There is no anime soundtrack. There are no schoolgirls, no tsundere, no moe, no giant robots.\
This is a TV show.\
Anyone can watch it and enjoy it.\
It has a plot, but it's also episodic so you can just sit down and watch it. \
It's about bounty hunters, something Sergio Leone made popular--and put to good use here.\
The characters are well put together with distinctive personalities (and an Homage to Lupin). Bruce-lee-esque Spike that looks like he's out of a 70s action flick, a Tarantino Movie, and stole his wardrobe from\
          \
        Lupin. Jet, the sensible foil to Spike--cop turned bounty hunter. Faye Valentine, the typical scantily clad woman. But her gambling problem, poignant backstory, and the fact she's out of place in the \"future\" world rounds her out perfectly. You could argue that the comedic \"Ed,\" a hacker child, is the least fitting out of the four, but honestly odd episodes like Mushroom Samba and when she searches for her father seem to redeem that. And finally there's Vicious, the cold hearted syndicate killer and perfect antagonist to Spike. His katana to Spike's guns.\
The settings are our solar system in the near future, with creative takes on each planet/moon--everything is beautiful and fitting, like Mosques on Venus, a sprawling Mars, crater-ridden Earth. Nothing extravagant, but the backgrounds are always there, noticeable, and fitting for the story. Shootouts in cathedrals, homage to kung fu, Tarantino, Leone. \
This is good because it's derivative of things that work. It has a great jazz soundtrack that doesn't fall prey to squeaky j-pop music and also matches the mood. The backstory is a simple one of the betrayal between men and women. The pacing is fast and uncluttered. \
And the ending is satisfying.\
This is also the only anime where the English dub is peerless and so much more fitting than the Japanese version.\
Watch it in order, or just watch one episode.\
If you have to buy just one anime for your collection, you can't go wrong with this--the replay value is excellent, like watching your favorite childhood action films on the weekends that you never get sick of.\
This is the exception to anime, not the norm. \
And something like this comes out every decade or two. It's impossible not to enjoy. If anime was more like this than the shit that's around now, it wouldn't be seen as a distraction for socially maladjusted shut-ins. \

    Let Cowboy Bebop serve as an example of why I consider praise for a series to be a spoiler in and of itself. For decades I have heard nothing but exaltation for Cowboy Bebop, and in the face of that kind of overwhelming critical and cult acclamation... it's hard not to be disappointed. If someone leads you to believe you will have your mind blown and your life changed, anything less makes the whole thing feel like they've made you put on a damp sweater. \
Maybe Cowboy Bebop is best considered within a particular social timeframe and cultural mindset. Maybe Cowboy Bebop is great because\
          \
        of the effect it had on a genre. Because I came to Cowboy Bebop almost two-decades late, however, none of that can bear upon my review of it. I can only review it as I experienced it. This is to say, I thought Cowboy Bebop was on the high side of okay.\
I like the characters. They're fun, they're interesting, they have some depth (but not a lot of growth). I like the world and the setting. The series passed the time. That's kind of where it ends for me. Perhaps it's a matter of taste, but I'm not very interested in episodic, short-term story telling and I wish that there'd been a series-long arc covering the dealings with the Syndicate to tie everything together. As it is, each episode is just a cast of characters doing a bunch of random crap and remaining unchanged as a result. This kind of storytelling is deeply dissatisfying for me--there's a reason why serialized dramas are ruling TV these days and why self-contained procedural dramas don't win awards. \
Ultimately, I was disappointed that Cowboy Bebop didn't strive to do more, to BE more, given the perfect cast, setting, and set-up for an engaging high-concept story. Bebop is a series that is better discovered at random--late night on TV or on a shelf in a 00's video store--than it is discovered due to its acclaim. It's better experienced for what it is than for what it could or should have been. \

    Shinichiro Watanabe's Cowboy Bebop is one of the legends of anime.  It's a program most anime viewers have heard of regardless of whether they've watched it in full or not and thanks to the multiple airings it's received over the years on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block it's a small number indeed who've never seen at least an episode.  I can safely say that before I purchased Bandai's recently released complete collection I'd seen most of the episodes on television in one order or another so I wasn't watching anything strikingly new but this does mark the first time I've watched Cowboy Bebop\
          \
        in full from beginning to end in the order it was intended and as a result I feel I'm up to the challenge of writing a proper critique of what I saw.  The back of the case for my complete collection informs me that Cowboy Bebop was 'voted (the) greatest anime of all time!'  Sale's pitches aside its an odd thing to say.  Unless you're a member of a doomsday cult I'd think it's safe to say we have a fair bit of time left till we have to decide what the greatest anything of all time was.  That said I had a lot of fun watching Cowboy Bebop and while I don't think it's one of anime's greatest contributions to visual media I can certainly see where it's reputation comes from.\
Cowboy Bebop takes place in the year 2071.  Decades earlier a system of gates was established to allow for easy travel throughout the solar system.  However, due to a fatal instability in the gate system that was ignored by the contractors, a disaster known as the Gate Accident occurred.  As a result of the accident most of Earth's surface was destroyed and humanity spread out to more habitable places on or around other planets.  This leads to a kind of neo-Wild West scenario with the central government and law enforcement agencies in a weakened state leading to a kind of lawlessness.  It is an institutionalized system of bounty hunters that picks up the slack and this is the concept much of the program centers on.\
The setting, as mentioned, is a kind of neo-Wild West in space, hence the 'Cowboy' half of the title.  Unlike Trigun, for example, which takes place in a setting that, steampunk elements aside, is virtually identical to that found in American Westerns, Cowboy Bebop plays out in a setting very much like the present.  Its science fiction but the world is nonetheless recognizable as being our own.  Some elements stand out on occasion from the rest of the world as though they were transposed straight out of a typical American Western with little thought to consistency with the rest of the setting (for example the occasional conspicuous presence of individuals dressed in ponchos and sombreros), but it all works nonetheless to create an intriguing world for the story lines to play out in.\
I tend to think that one the reasons for Cowboy Bebop's monumental success is the fact that it is a very fun, easy show to watch.  It doesn't make any demands on the viewer with its highly episodic nature and lack of any real overarching plot.  The closest Cowboy Bebop comes to having one is the story of Spike's past and even then it only occupies five episodes out of the total twenty-six. By and large, episodes either focus on the story of a specific bounty or on developing the main cast and their pasts and even though Spike's story is given the most attention it still suffers from the limited amount of time it receives.  In fact, if I were pressed, I'd have to say that the main story line is not exclusively about Spike's past at all but about everyone's.  The members of the crew of the spaceship Bebop all have troubled pasts which they all eventually have to face up to and that they will either overcome and move on or be destroyed.\
To it's credit Cowboy Bebop possesses a well-developed essentially likable cast of characters.  Spike, Jet, and Faye are all interesting characters and even Ed, despite remaining largely a question mark throughout compared to the rest, is still a fun character to watch.  Problems arise, however, with members of the supporting cast, specifically those involved with Spike's past.  His past is revealed with a wonderful sense of subtlety throughout via the use of flashes of memory, succeeding to tell a complete story despite the time constraints.  However Spike's old associates from the Red Dragon syndicate don't come out so well.  Julia and particularly Vicious receive very little development.  Some characters from stand-alone bounty hunting episodes are more developed.  Often the most understanding that is provided about these characters comes solely from Spike&rsquo;s reactions to them which, to be fair, often proves to be enough.\
On the audio/visual front Cowboy Bebop is quite the success.  Character designs by Toshihiro Kawamoto are consistently appealing and the animation is smooth utilizing a nicely done blend of two dimensional and computer generated animation.  For the purposes of this review I watched the dub for Cowboy Bebop which is regarded as one of the best with good reason.  All members of the cast fit their characters well and convey believable emotion when needed.  Yoko Kanno should need little introduction for her role in composing the soundtrack, focusing primarily on jazz while providing a fair variety of other genres throughout.  All in all a very high quality production even ten years later.\
Overall, for me, Cowboy Bebop isn't a favorite, my main gripe being my issues with the story line.  However, despite that it proved to be a very fun, perhaps even addictive show to watch.  It has a wonderful soundtrack and a cast of characters well worth remembering after the final credit scroll.  For this I award it an overall rating of 8/10.\

    What can I say about this that hasn't been said before?\
This was the show that got me into anime, which looking back at how much time I've lost to it since might not have been such a good thing. There's just something about this, it's easy to feel but hard to pin down. The characters have incredible chemistry, the english dub is one of the best ever recorded, the art style is beautiful and stands up well for it's age, and the soundtrack is probably the strongest I've ever heard. You can tell that the creators had a lot of fun making this because there\
          \
        are so many unique pieces that all fit together in the end product. It's sort of timeless, and I don't think it'll ever stop feeling cool. I keep this show about 5 feet from the DVD player at all times, and this is the first show I recommend to anyone asking me about getting into anime. It's not nostalgia, it's just great. Without a doubt, it was the best of 1998, which had Trigun, Serial Experiments Lain, and Outlaw star all come out then too. If you haven't seen it, but you watch anime, what is wrong with you? This is one of the biggest pillars in anime history, you owe it to yourself to see it.\

    I started because it's supposed to be a classic, but I was disappointed. There were certain aspects that I enjoyed, such as the music. There's a different style of music every episode, reflecting the theme and setting of whatever's going on, which is pretty unique.\
The main thing that turned me off was the story-line. There are a few recurring themes, but it is mainly episodic, with maybe one arc that lasts and entire two episodes. The individual stories of each episode are generally okay and sometimes go deep into the backstory of the characters, giving the audience a better idea of who they are and\
          \
        where they cam from. However there's just nothing to pull everything together. Each character has a few episodes to illustrate their backstories, but there's just nothing to pull it all together.\
Overall, I think it's worth watching. It's a classic, and it's only 26 episodes. I just think that it was so over-hyped (being a classic and all) that I was just expecting more.\

    What is the measure of a classic? \
The dictionary would suggest that a classic is: n. is an outstanding example of a particular style; something of lasting worth or with a timeless quality; of the first or highest quality, class, or rank – something that exemplifies its class. Something that stands the test of time, is remembered fondly, and has continued appeal. \
Historically, the world classic itself typically imbues a connotation of antiquity- Greeks, Romans, ancient literature, artwork, even music. It inspires originality and derives from that a long-lasting impact.\
The audience would likely suggest a less abstract definition and instead give examples. In film, you'd\
          \
        get a Citizen Kane or a Sunset Boulevard or a Rear Window. In television, a wider range of things.\
There are even such things as \"modern classics\", like my beloved Ringtone Rap.\
In anime, the definition of classic- well... that debate is still hotly contested. One name, that continually rises up through sifting of the ever growing mound of coarse sand that is anime however, is that of Cowboy Bebop. \
\
Bebop checks off all the boxes for an enduring, beloved series- it has the characters, it's easy to follow, it's got the tunes, a tightly controlled artistic direction that sets it apart from the rest of the pack, and most importantly- it's entertaining. There is a reason why certain shows like Seinfeld, Spongebob, Andy Griffith, The Flintstones, Friends, Star Trek, and many others continued to air on TV long after their expiration date: accessibility. Many of the longest running shows on television center on a long running, slow unfolding story arc, often involving a large family or group of them- such as Dallas, the Sopranos, or Game of Thrones. They tell interwoven stories with a myriad of characters over a period of years, and as such, length of the show is hampered only by the creative output of the creators. \
To create such a show that, within its relatively short length of 26 episodes (everything listed above numbers in the hundreds of episodes, or will, by the end of the run) manages to cover such a wide range of topics and stories in a self contained format is a feat indeed. One of the most common criticisms of scripted shows like this are their episodic or short arc nature. The people want a singular story to follow- a goal, a direction. Episodic series often feel uneven in tone and pacing, not to mention disjointed due to the constant shift and restarting that's necessary to keep the show accessible to new viewers who may not have seen previous episodes. \
Cowboy Bebop doesn't necessarily rely on viewers to have seen all of the preceding episodes to be able to enjoy any given episode, and to me, this is one of the great charms the show has- the ability to pick it up wherever, and enjoy it. I think this is also why it's had lasting success on Adult Swim since its original airing in 2001. Bebop is a lot of fun to watch, no matter where in the series you pick it up; and that enjoyability is due in no small part to the writing and direction. Certain long running shows can have very interesting plots, and be loaded with poorly written characters, but still manage to garner a large viewing audience who want to follow along- shows that have intriguing concepts, but poor execution. \
For an episodic series like Bebop to succeed, the emphasis doesn't necessarily need to be on making every single story plot the most interesting and wacky thing out there, but rather to be anchored by /characters/ you want to watch interact and react to situations. Indeed, it is characters that drive this story, and not the other way around. \
A show's greatest sin is to be unentertaining. If a show is \"boring\", it has failed at its' most fundamental level- being entertainment. \
\
Boring, Bebop is not. The characters are unique, and how they work, play, and fight together is decidedly endearing. Each character has their charm and their wit. Spike, the central protagonist, is a mysterious James Bond-esque man of many skills- particularly in combat. Throughout the show, there are several overarching questions about his past, which are revealed through about 5 episodes throughout. However, this kind of information about the character is really just a bonus, because it takes all of one episode to know what kind of character he is: the sharp dressing, sardonic, quintessential cool- cigarettes, guns and all. He's not without depth or flaws, however. There's more behind the man than the mask of calm, cool, and collected. \
He is set opposite the very antithesis of calm, cool and collected in Faye- a beautiful young woman with an equally mysterious past that's explored in several later episodes. She plays an important role in the team though, instead of just being the token female or there for fanservice. She's another multifaceted character with more than meets the eye, and frequently steals the spotlight. \
The trio is rounded off with Jet- the \"I'm too old for this crap\" retired cop archetype. Jet exists as the grounded personality between Spike's frustration and Faye's outbursts, and generally serves as the voice of reason between the two extremes: his crewmates, hothead and impulsive. \
Soundwise, the show is superb. I make no secret of being a fan of Yoko Kanno, but this is the show that catapulted her to stardom in the anime industry. It's got a fantastic blend of moody orchestral pieces juxtaposed with the titular bebop jazz. There's funk, there's electronica, and there's even an episode devoted to heavy metal. A more diverse soundtrack you are unlikely to find, and there will certainly be something for everyone to enjoy with such a variety of tunes. As far as the voice acting goes, Steve Blum, Wendee Lee, and Beau Billingslea all do fantastic jobs as Spike, Faye, and Jet respectively. \
The art, too, is fantastic for the time. In 2017, Bebop could be considered an \"old\" anime, clocking in at a geriatric 19 years of age. Don't let the number fool you though, as the hand drawn art maintains a great consistency in quality and fluidity throughout the show's run. The show features a great variety in locales, vehicles, and characters. Due to the episodic nature, very few episodes take place in the same locations, and a number of different themes in art direction show up in the show. There are full on neo-noir episodes, complete with the black and white look, detectives, etc. and other more darkly colored ones with slow fades to reveal a what looks to be a puddle is actually blood. There are a number of western themed episodes, mafia, casino, and others. Definitely no shortage of different motifs. \
One of my favorite episodes was the magic mushroom episode, where, due to a food shortage, Spike, Faye, and Jet all end up eating psychedelic mushrooms they've mistaken for portabellas, and it's up to Edward to actually track down some real food. Though it's a silly episode played for laughs, it actually succeeds in taking a needed break from the action. The \"Pierrot Le Fou\" episode, which reminded me heavily of the 1992 Batman Animated series, involves a superhuman test subject that resembles The Penguin, who loses his mind and goes nuts, attacking anyone and everyone. The episode is downright creepy, and Spike's showdown with him at the end is quite clever, and, as mentioned before- really seems like a Batman episode. \
That said, and being episodic, some episodes are a mixed bag. A few that are supposed to be touching just felt a bit out of place, and others that were more comedic in tone fell a bit flat when it involved someone other than the main three. The recurring \"Spike and Faye manage to screw up somehow and lose the bounty they're hunting, or they unexpectedly die\" gag wears thin pretty quickly, and the formulaic nature of the first few episodes gets kinda old, too. The second half of the show is definitely where it all comes together though, and the ending was rather unexpected for a show of this type, and succeeded in grabbing me by the heart. \
All that to say: Cowboy Bebop is exactly what I would consider to be a classic.  \
See you, Space Cowboy.\

    Since being a critic means writing tons of words, people often think of us as pretentious assholes who can’t have fun. Some critics swallow that crap and then write meaningless bullcrap instead of admitting they enjoyed a stylish, flashy story. The easiest way to recognize it is when a series is said to be about ‘existentialism’. That’s so general, but so useful. After all, that stream of philosophy is huge and you can insert anything into it.\
Since I don’t care about my image, I’m not going to claim Cowboy Bebop is about ‘existentialism’ when I can’t back it up. I have no shame in admitting\
          \
        I love a story that’s all about flash, action and amusing characters. That’s what Cowboy Bebop is and it’s proof that mere storytelling is an art too. There are a few touching moments and the last episodes push for something more profound, but until then there isn’t any depth. Why should it have any when “Mushroom Samba” is one of the best anime episodes ever?\
Watanabe taglined the show as “a new genre unto itself” and later called it an exaggeration. That’s like the fastest runner in the world saying he’s slow. Cowboy Bebop never runs out of steam or ideas. It always has a wide-eyed sense of wonder and always excited what other stories it can tell. Many of the tropes are recognizable, but nothing is a missed chance.\
The approach is akin to a band that tries a new genre with every song. People who complain about the episodic nature miss the point. The series has a wider reach than nearly every anime out there. Pretty much every episode is a whole different genre. The characters and art style are the same, but even the color schemes change. “Mushroom Samba” and “Cowboy Funk” are experiments with Comedy and have brighter colors. “Toys in the Attic” experiments with horror and is noticeably darker.\
Even pacing and side-character design changes. The aforementioned “Mushroom Samba” has far wackier character design than “Speak Like a Child”, one of the more introspective episodes. The series doesn’t simply borrow a lot from Western fiction but distills it to one show. It had mass appeal because it had a wide reach – whoever you are, there’s something to like her.\
Convincing the viewer that the world in your anime exists is difficult. Calling things ‘realistic’ or ‘unrealistic’ isn’t enough, since you first have to know what reality is (or, more correctly, how people perceive reality). The solid blocks don’t define reality. Spaceships and cities on the moon aren’t automatically ‘unrealistic’. If you told people from 1000 years ago that anime will exist they’ll think you’re possessed by a devil.\
Reality and real life go deeper than this. Reality is, among things, confusing and has a lot of sides. If it didn’t we wouldn’t need to create art. The most realistic anime are the most far-reaching ones. An anime is more realistic the more it can contain different moods and different people. It doesn’t matter whether you live as a drifter or in a small community – life has all kinds of things going for it.\
The show has bounty hunters in space, loud gunfights and a failed experiment that learned to fly. It’s still more realistic – and thus more alive than most anime out there. The variety in mood and texture of the events brings it to life. I couldn’t imagine a show having a fat balloon assassin feeling realistic.\
The cast is also a prime example of how to have an ensemble. Spike isn’t the main character. They’re all are. Their personalities aren’t simply different but connected, there is chemistry here. Jet isn’t just a contrast to Spike’s apathy, but a more warm figure for the damaged Faye and the young Ed. Spike’s apathy and cockiness is what puts him at odds with Faye but their greed is what they share and what unites them. Ed herself is a sun in the group of depressed individuals. The characters don’t act out of convenience but on their inner drives, and each of their reactions is uniquely theirs.\
Variety itself isn’t enough, of course. You need more than the basics of having different episodes with different styles and moods. The narratives are always tightly focused. The world is full of great anime, but few deserve the award of ‘no useless shots’. Except for the plot-heavy episodes (which don’t really work anyway), every shot equals progress.\
It’s worth noting that Cowboy Bebop isn’t a dialogue-heavy show. It borrowed this from the film noire genre. Unlike noire’s bad side, Bebop doesn’t rely on dark shots to let you things are dark. Rather, it doesn’t use a lot of dialogue because it doesn’t need to. The shots are informative enough, and so are never boring.\
The series’ only flaw is the grand story behind it focusing on Spike’s past. The series doesn’t exactly lose focus, but confidence. Up until then the defining trait was elegance. Everything was small, but it was enough that counted for a lot. Suddenly we have this huge backstory of broken hearts and smoking guns and overthrowing a criminal syndicate. The last two episodes, while having decent actions, end up mostly as a collection of serious dialogue and dark staring. It survives only on the show’s natural charm. This is one route that demanded a whole new way of storytelling. It’s nice of Watanabe to try but it didn’t work.\
Cowboy Bebop is a great anime not because it’s philosophical, influential or borrows a lot from Western fiction. It’s brilliant because it’s a masterpiece of pure storytelling. There are no useless parts in these 23 or so episodes. Each story is different both in events, pacing and mood. People who are uncomfortable with this will make stuff up about ‘existentialism’ but it’s their loss. Regardless of who you are, there’s something to enjoy here.\

    The story is pretty much episodic and not traditionally serial like the majority of anime. Each episode, they watch a show for bounty hunters that provide them information on the latest thugs that are out there ranging from petty drug dealers, to big time hitmen, and universally threatening terrorists. But I felt there are some certain episodes that the series could have lived without. Like episode 11 where a blob comes out of the refrigerator. \
What I really like about this anime is that it's very character driven. Like Spike despite having a very reckless nature and can crack wise jokes, tends to have a\
          \
        very indirect and not so straight forward personality if you try to have a normal conversation with him. He&rsquo;s not really anti-social, it&rsquo;s just that he&rsquo;s not a people person, and is really private. Ed is just this whacky genius kid and you have no idea what goes on in her head. Faye is the freeloader. And Jet is who you can say is the parental figure aboard the bebop. These personalities equal to some very great chemistry and very realistic interactions because of how the characters express themselves and their general personalities. \
In terms of art and animation quality, this anime was the gateway between the 1990s and the new millenium. It perfectly mixes CG and 2D art. One of the other animes doing it that around this time was Initial D, which wasn&rsquo;t really as amazing as Cowboy Bebop&rsquo;s but still cool. But Cowboy Bebop just perfectly blended it together and did not make you lose a certain grip of what you were viewing. \
The action of this anime ranges from John Woo style explosive stand offs, aerial dog fights, and martial arts. So you&rsquo;re getting everything in terms of action. A lot of scenes were influenced by Kung Fu and John Woo movies. Like the climatic battle in episode 5 is based on John Woo&rsquo;s the Killer, and all of Spike&rsquo;s movements when he does hand to hand combat is all based on Bruce Lee. His footwork, his stances, the way he lunges, all of it. And of course Spike is a student of Bruce Lee&rsquo;s martial arts philopshy, Jeet Kune Do, meaning the intercepting fist. There is one episode where he tries to teach a guy martial arts and he even uses one of Bruce Lee&rsquo;s famous and iconic quotes of &ldquo;be like water.&rdquo; \
The design is very distinctive and the characters are diverse but you see some references to other animes in it. Like Spike&rsquo;s clothing style and his color scheme does pay homage to Lupin III. And I can&rsquo;t say for certain, but Faye&rsquo;s design does remind me of Major Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell with her look and the hair color being purple. The space ships are quite original and have a great design to them. They have excellent frames where it matches their aerial agilities in combat or in high speeds. \
Thanks to the addition of Yoko Kanno, then expect top notch music in this anime in its own respective style in compliments to the atmosphere. The jazz and blues soundtrack is one of the other most associative qualities this anime has that makes it so great. It flows so well with the action scenes by making you sit back and enjoy the excitement, and yet it also reflects the easygoing personality Spike still manages to maintain in his fights against tomato can opponents. And sometimes, it will have some more powerful sounding songs like Rain that goes so well with the scenery. Tank, the opening theme gives somewhat of an old school feel to it like you&rsquo;re watching a 1970s action movie and the song alone is good enough to show you&rsquo;re going to see something that goes beyond your expectations. \
Both the Japanese and English versions are excellent. It really doesn&rsquo;t matter what version you&rsquo;re going to watch because both tracks just do an accurate job of making you feel the characters. However, my only problem with the dub is that the black co-host in the bounty hunting tv show sounds more like a southern white guy. But moving on, both Koichi Yamadera (the voice of Ryoga in Ranma, Togusa in Ghost in the Shell, and Kaji in Evangelion) and Steven Blum really bring out Spike&rsquo;s laid back, humorous, serious, and not so straightforward personality. \
Seiyuu legend, Megumi Hayashibara (the voice of female Ranma, Rei from Evangelion, and Lina Inverse from Slayers) and Wendee Lee approach Faye&rsquo;s character as being mysterious, captivating, broken hearted, and yet is somewhat of a motivator. \
And Unsho Ishizuka (the voice of Miyata-san from Hajime no Ippo, Sasaki from History&rsquo;s Strongest Disciple Ken&rsquo;ichi, and Bunta from Initial D) and his English corresponding actor, Beau Billingslea, both do an excellent job of portraying Jet as being somewhat part comic relief, but yet has a grouchy personality at the same time and brings out the big brother/father figure to the Bebop. \
In the past, lots of people have talked about a sequel. This anime does not need a sequel. The ending is perfect. The director should not have gone out and said there is no conformation or any implication of what the ending really meant. I really love 100% conclusive endings. I rank this the 2nd best ending behind Ashita no Joe. But on the other hand, I can understand making a prequel. I&rsquo;d like to know how a run out cop and a runaway hitman teamed up to become bounty hunters. Like make a story of how Spike and Jet met. Make an OAV about Faye during her past. I like to know more about the characters to get a better understanding of them, and I feel this series would be a bit more complete, not saying the series is, but some of the small things did leave me curious. \
So if you like martial arts action, dog fights, John Woo, Dog the Bounty Hunter, sci-fi, and space opera mixed with a story that doesn&rsquo;t really have to be linear, but driven more by the characters, than this is for you. It&rsquo;s very, very great, but short of perfect.\

         Cowboy Bebop is a household name to anime fans. Either you've seen it, or you've at least heard about it from your friends. Being one of the original anime aired in the US via Cartoon Network, it served as a gateway anime for many, a taste of what Japanese animation has to offer. Because of this, many people give it glowing reviews as a masterpiece, and a textbook example of what a good anime is. I am not of those people. I'm from the latter group of people, who heard the reviews about how good it was. So naturally, I\
          \
        had to see if the hype train was real, if it's really that good, or if people think it's better than it really is because of the sentimentality of it being(probably) their first anime. Here are my thoughts:\
Story:6\
     The story of Bebop is a bit convoluted, in the sense that it's a roller coaster of fillerish material and key plot points. What I mean by that is that the series definitely has its ups and downs, with the down episodes seeming to have no point to the overall progression(essentially filler), and the up episodes having lots of action and plot in a 20 minute block(these are of course, sprinkled throughout the 26 episodes). While Bebop does a great job of tying everything together into a cohesive story by the end, I found that in the midst of it, I could never expect what was going to happen in the next episode, which makes it hard to follow the story as you watch it. So overall, the story overall is good, but falls apart episode to episode. I wish the main plot was emphasized more throughout the whole anime, as opposed to the last 4-5 episodes.\
Art:8\
     The artwork in this anime is good, so much so that I was surprised when i found out it was 15 years old. Obviously it won't look as good as your 2014 summer anime, but the art style definitely complements the overall feel of the anime. I think if you redid the anime with modern animation, it wouldn't hold up well at all. You pair a sort of western feeling anime with a sort of choppy grainy animation, and it definitely works. No complaints here.\
Sound:10\
     What I said for the art holds even more true for the sound. In my opinion, the sound is what really carries this anime. The music in this anime is very jazzy, ranging from upbeat to emotional pieces, from the sultry orchestral opening to the subtle guitar/piano background music scattered throughout. I don't think the creators could have done a better job of pairing music with animation, because the music really does set the tone well. Even if you're not the type to actively listen to the music in your anime, I bet you'd be surprised by how easily you could pick out a song from Bebop if you heard it somewhere else. Hell, I bet if you gave me a piano I could learn the opening by ear, and that's saying something. It's that memorable.\
Character:7\
     The characters in Bebop are a likeable motley crue of varying personalities. No one is particularly fascinating(although the dog Ein is hilarious), but no one is particularly boring either. They're just a very normal, dare I say average, group. No Makoto-esque characters that make you want to swallow a spoon and/or yell at your screen(damn you School Days), and no *Insert stereotypical heroine from harem anime here*-esque characters with the emotional depth of a puddle. I will say that the characters are developed well throughout the anime, so the filler I mentioned earlier did serve a point. Although, considering your main cast consists of 4 characters and a badass dog, character development should be a given considering 26 episodes is significantly longer that your typical 12 episode animes, and you've got such a small cast to work with.\
Enjoyment:7\
     I usually judge my enjoyment factor by how many episodes I can watch in a row before I want to do something else, with 1 episode being painful to watch(School Days, Aku no Hana) and 5+ being \"Holy shit! Is it that late already?!?\"(A Certain Magical Index, Clannad). Bebop scores in the 2-3 range, usually 2. The reason I'm scoring that in the middle is because of the roller coastering(Adding that to dictionary) between episodes. You finish one episode that's awesome, and action packed, and makes you want to punch a stranger because \"fuck yeah!\".....and then the next episode is kinda boring. Usually I stop after a boring (and I'm using boring here to contrast the exciting episodes, not so much that the episode it self is terribly boring) episode, which is about every other episode.\
Overall:7(Worth watching once)\
     Overall, Bebop is a good anime. Is it worthy of the more recent Attack on Titan or Sword Art Online hype train that it still garners(For those of you who have been lambasted for not watching those while they were airing like me, you know what I' m talking about), I don't think so. It's worth a watch if you haven't seen it already, but it's not worth seeking out for anime enlightenment. It's not your anime Mecca, and I challenge anybody who thinks that it is to watch it again without bias, because I bet if you're one of the people who watched it when you were younger, you'll find that it's not as good as your remembered. You'll probably still enjoy it, but it won't seem as fulfilling the second time around.",

    'The work which becomes a new genre itself will be called Cowboy Bebop'\
Cowboy Bebop is one of the few shows which can actually be called Epic.  Not an epic such as the Homeric poetry but epic as Webster&rsquo;s Dictionary says &ldquo;extending beyond the usual or ordinary especially in size or scope.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s a word that shouldn&rsquo;t be used lightly.  Cowboy Bebop is the standard by which Anime should be molded after.  It achieves near perfection in creation and at the end there is a feeling of fulfillment.  No other anime has a more complete and satisfying ending.\
The story element is\
          \
        where many great animes get their strength from but Cowboy Bebop is actually weakest here.  The story is very individualized, rarely do the events of one episode effect other episodes.  Yet despite this &ldquo;episodic&rdquo; design, actual plot is occasionally used and by the end it feels like the plot has always been a part of the show like a shadow that had just been noticed.  \
In other anime I can&rsquo;t think of too many action scenes that can come even close to those in Cowboy Bebop.  Motion is almost always drawn smoothly and action scenes are incredible to watch.  As Spike says, &ldquo;like water.&rdquo;  The artists did a superb job in being able to create a certain mood through lightening and the vibrant/dull of colors.  The artwork altogether is incredible and visually everything feels natural.  \
The sound was particularly enjoyable.  There was a good amount of jazz music which fits Bebop well due to the uncertainty which is the foundation of jazz music.  I wasn&rsquo;t too fond of the opening theme though(I&rsquo;m probably the only one).  But in eps 5 near the end and at the conclusion of eps 26, the music is beyond incredible.  It honestly speaks about the show in ways words could never describe and help elevate Bebop to levels rarely achieved.  But like I said, for some reason I hate the opening theme.  \
Because the story is sort of &ldquo;weak&rdquo; the characters are the driving force of the show.  This is where Bebop is made.  The characters are all vastly different and don&rsquo;t really fit any particular clich&eacute;s, which is quite refreshing.  All you need to know is that you won&rsquo;t find more original and more entertaining characters anywhere else.\
If this anime doesn&rsquo;t speak to you or inspire you, don&rsquo;t worry because it is extremely fun to watch.  Bebop won&rsquo;t put you in stitches for the full 20 minutes nor will it try to force you to enjoy the show.  Instead it does it&rsquo;s own thing and you can&rsquo;t help but smile while watching.  The Bebop crew is just pure fun and I guarantee you will enjoy it.\
Conclusion:  Cowboy Bebop is not my #1 personal favorite show, but it is the most complete and perfect anime out there.  It is in all sense of the word, A Masterpiece.  Bebop may not be exactly what you want for an ideal story anime, but in no way does that take away from it.  The light hearted and random episodes are fun all the way through.  The characters are very likeable and create a great atmosphere.  The visual style and sound combine with the other elements in a perfect blend to make a perfect show (or as close as you can get).  This may not be your favorite show but you will not be disappointed and at the very least you will finish with a smile feeling as satisfied as if you finished eating a great meal.",

    There are quite a lot of anime that have a western setting, yet it is rare to see ones that contain the typical \"wild west\" feeling, much less portray in a convincing manner, in which viewers may associate it to adventure and mayhem, rash shootings and cowboys. While this may seem generic, Cowboy Bebop is a character driven story that came as a very pleasant surprise, as it managed to transmit magnificently such theme, with several tweaks to the setting itself. Furthermore, even when it was for the majority of the series of episodic nature, it managed to properly narrate a story with very interesting\
          \
        and varied episodes, whilst fleshing out its cast accordingly; which is difficult and rare in the medium.\
~Story~\
The story of Cowboy Bebop is centered on the members of the spaceship \"The Bebop\", Spike and Jet, a drifter and retired cyborg cop whose profession is bounty hunting for a living. They meet a lot of odd characters, in which Faye and Ed are one of the main highlights. As mentioned earlier, what is curious is the context of the series: it has its setting in the year 2071 in which humanity has left earth and settled themselves amongst the stars. What is more, it came together with the collapse of nations, and thus the emergence of disorder, violence, freedom and wild shootings -  it has the typical western \"cowboy\" feeling attached to it. It also shares it moments of comedy here and there, which are subtly and well introduced in several occasions without breaking immersion in the story.\
This anime is for the major part of the series of episodic nature, yet what is remarkable is the variety within these. Each has its own unique and intriguing story, be it the virus that turn humans into monkeys, the classic parody to the Alien movie, the wacky cowboy, you name it. What further enhances the experience is the fact that each episode provides a feeling of continuity, including great world building showing the viewer how 2071 is, in addition to developing and fleshing its cast accordingly along the way. Some may argue that there are some episodes of lower quality, as it can be hit or miss, yet I found it to be in general of high quality. This doesn't mean the anime doesn't have its share of serious episodes in which actual story progression takes place regarding the characters, in particular that of Spike. These are brimming with life, action and love, giving viewers insight in the characters: it is filled with tension and intrigue. It is worth mentioning that the conclusion of the series is arguably of the most satisfying ones in the anime industry.\
~Characters~\
Cowboy Bebop is a character driven story, and thus the characters are of great importance to the story to make it work properly, and the anime managed to achieve this masterfully. Although the characters may be considered as stereotypes, in this case it is apparent that these can be very interesting when approached correctly. First of all, it must be mentioned that most of the characters have a mysterious background which is not apparent to viewers at first, yet as story progresses, it is slowly revealed in several bits. Ultimately, most of these are portrayed to audiences in a satisfying manner, yet not fully clarified in some cases, which is left for the viewer to imagine. This may be lacluster for some, but in this case it actually works in its favour to maintain the intrigue and splendid atmosphere of the anime.\
The members of the spaceship \"Bebop\" are composed of intriguing and entertaining characters, almost everyone being developed and fleshed out. There is Spike, a calm and cunning, somewhat lazy guy, yet immensely likeable whose motives on staying on the ship are not quite apparent at first, yet with am intriguing past. Then there is Jet, the hard-boiled and hardworking cop, now retired from the profession for bounty hunting instead. Other character of interest is Faye Valentine, a tomboy yet cunning woman, to being at times quite arrogant; but this is all because of her brittle past, which adds to the credibility of her character. Ultimately there is Ed, a superhacker girl, an energetic careless person who acts very childishly; she seems to be there for comical relief, yet it is apparent that she is slowly developed and as well as cunning, albeit in small measures.\
Other remarkable aspect of the anime are the interactions with the cast: all of the characters have such diverse personalities that is bizarre to see them all together and interact each other; what ties them together are their common goals, be it revenge, greed, profit, convenience, you name it. The relationships are slowly developed according to their personal development, which was a nice touch to the show. As for the secondary characters and \"villains\" if you may, these are for the majority quite interesting with sometimes motives, or intriguing past that showcase the hardships of society. Some either serve to enhance the comedy, world building, or the story plot itself.\
~Animation and sound~\
The animation quality of Cowboy Bebop is fantastic, even when considering in aired in the late 90's. The actions scenes, for both combat and space battles, are very fluid giving insight of the whole battle scene to the viewer. In addition, the choreography involved is detailed and feels realistic, further enhancing the experience. As for the art style itself, it is befitting of the atmosphere with very detailed backgrounds; not to mention the great usage of lighting effects to the anime that serves to intone the various atmospheres. The character designs are well done as well, varied and intriguing, matching with the corresponding personalities. However, there were times in which some backgrounds/characters were not as detailed, yet this was a small issue.\
Concerning the music score, it is truly outstanding: the use of jazz, blues and classic rock may seem odd considering its setting, yet it fits magnificently with the atmosphere. Each piece is also adjusted to the various situations. The fact that there are 4 CD's with over 80 different pieces composed for the series shows the dedication the studio had for the anime. As for the voice actors, these performed their roles splendidly, matching with the different personalities and intonations used. What came to me as a surprise, is the fact that the english dub was as good (or maybe even better) to the japanese one, which is noteworthy. The openings and endings of the anime were well executed and befitting of the theme, such as Tank!, surely one of the most famous ones.\
~Enjoyment~\
Cowboy Bebop was overall a great anime, with fantastic characters and their respective development and fleshing out. The soundtracks used in addition to the animation enhanced the viewing experience greatly; the fact that the anime managed to convey an intriguing story despite being of episodic nature was a huge bonus as well. Some viewers may be bothered by this and find them lackluster, as it can be hit/miss for some; the fact that the story is nothing extremely grandiose can be an issue as well, yet at a personal level this was never the case. So do I recommend this anime? I wholeheartedly do to anyone of any demographic, as the characters in conjunction with the animation and sound certainly makes it almost a must watch.\

    (7.0/10)\
Cowboy Bebop was one of the first few anime that I properly sat down and watched. After the horrible atrocity that was Fate/Zero I asked my friend to give me something \"a little different\", perhaps a little more \"western\" in its storytelling. Mainly because I had some pretty ignorant assumptions on cultural storytelling back then. \
Well, he was nice enough to give me Cowboy Bebop. A show he described as, \"the most western anime ever.\" Cool. I sat down and watched it in about a week. \
I left with a few mixed feelings, but overall, it was a positive experience that I think many anime\
          \
        fans rightfully call a \"classic\" in the medium. Much like the show, i'll break up this review into small digestible chunks. \
__________________________________________________________________________________________________\
PART 1 : The Purpose of a Genre \
\
Television works in funny ways. Well, not really funny as much as generic, obvious, and pandering. Even in Japan, where the entire culture is different than America's, the way television (and film) is created is still similar. The demographic of the script is determined, the show/film gets its director and production company, it gets funded, and the shooting begins. That's one of the many ways something can get started.\
The key term here is demographic. Everything is made for an audience, and that audience is everything for what's being made. Put simply, if no one is watching and buying; then your product is caput. The way you make sure that at least someone will watch and buy is by determining something called a demographic. Which pretty much means the sex and age range of an audience. \
For example, a show like Sword Art Online is made with the 13-17 male demographic, however, it has reaches into the 18-27 male demographic as well. The show is adapted from the manga(or is it a LN i'm not sure) with the same key demographic. So a bunch of people come together and talk about what people in that age like. \
Titties : Check\
Loud anime yelling : Check\
Self-insert wish fulfillment : Check \
Flashy animation when fighting actually happens : Check\
...\
With these concepts they created the most generic and marketable show possible. Their show is the literal equivalent of oatmeal with nothing on it. Something that's easily edible. \
But the point is that these people created this show with this audience in mind. This means that the show excels (hopefully) at these certain things. If you need fan service to appeal to a bunch of horny teenage boys, then you try your best to make it be some really damn good fan service! If you need loud moralistic anime protagonist, you better get the most generic possible self-insert wish-fulfilling protagonist you can! \
So while this show may suck massive meat-wagons its still a show that excels at those things. \
...\
This leads me to Cowboy Bebop. A show that doesn't really excel at anything. A show that doesn't really fit in a base genre. Sure people sometimes call it a \"space opera\" but that's a horribly defined genre, in my opinion. It pretty much encapsulates every possible base genre. It has comedy, horror, drama, action, and mystery. \
__________________________________________________________________________________________________\
PART 2 : Lack of a Flavor is More of a Flavor\
\
So what exactly does \"it just kinda does everything pretty good\", mean? Well for one it means that I came out of the show thoroughly...fine. Nothing really stood out as mind-blowing or even great, but everything flowed decently well that I never really found the show to be a slog to sit through. The entire thing felt so harmless. \
Its attempts at emotion were fine, its action was generally pretty good, the detours into more experimental one-off episodes was fairly pleasing as well. It had a decently designed cast with a cute little dog cause signature pets are cool to have. It had a story that flowed well, although wasn't given enough time to actually become something special. It followed an episodic structure that felt good to watch but ultimately didn't add much to the show... more on that later. \
With this lack of focused genre, it really felt like the show was just middle-of-the-pack on everything. Which is why I can't really bring myself to criticize all too much. It quite literally does almost everything well enough that I don't have much to say on it. \
Our titular protagonist is a charming semi-douche that is ultimately more like-able and interesting than most anime protagonists. His companions are all fairly engaging too. Faye has a great character design, Jet has a nice presence, Edward is ultimately the comedic relief and so on. \
Point is, the show is just good. Throughout all the episodes, which play out very episodically, I found myself not having any disdain towards any of them. Sure most of them weren't all too memorable... the standouts being one with mushrooms, one with a fridge, and one with a fat man floating around like a balloon. But overall, they had some decent sci-fi storylines with decent execution. \
__________________________________________________________________________________________________\
PART 3 : Story Without Story \
\
So the one thing that bugged me about the show was its execution of the main storyline. While its episodic by nature, every half-way point we have a story-driven episode that revolves around our protagonist, Spike. I won't spoil what its about but it involves love and heartbreak, duh. \
So with these story-driven episodes, the show shifts from meandering fourth gear to a full-out lore-mode fifth gear. The switch doesn't often feel natural, but the episodes themselves are all generally pretty good. \
However, the biggest issue is that the writers don't give these stories enough time. I can think of a handful of disconnected episodes that could've been cut in favor of creating a more interesting and believable story. \
Since this whole story-arc literally takes only five episodes to resolve, the other twenty one episodes are just kind of there. Five episodes is hardly enough time to create any believable characters or engaging interactions that lead to a very bombastic conclusion in a way that feels emotionally powerful.\
Specifically, Spike's love from his past, Julia, gets a truly pitiful amount of development. This creates scenes that are meant to be emotional into yet another \"ok\" scene. It doesn't feel bad as much as it just feels \"ok\". \
But the reason I feel like i can't give a show a pass for this is because they played this entire thing out like it was supposed to be something bigger. A big arc. But they didn't give it enough time. Why do an episodic series of twenty six episodes and only give the story five? Especially if you only want one season? It felt like a nonsensical idea to me. \

Conclusion : \
\
Honestly, this review seems harsher than it needs to be. Saying the show is \"mediocre\" would mean its a 5.0/10. Its not mediocre. Its definitely above average, and the character interaction, for the most part, is good enough to elevate the show. \
It has some very well choreographed fight sequences and some very genuine moments. Its overall a very pleasant show to watch. For me, it isn't the untouchable classic that many may call it, its still a good time that i'd recommend to any fan of television. \
It may have not thought out its base storyline enough to make it something special, but some of the standout episodic episodes do more than enough to create a smooth and memorable experience. \

    I think its quite saddening that I don't have anything better to do than writing a review. On christmas! However, this really needs to be done at some point, and while other people are eating cookies, I'll do this one: Cowboy Bebop Review Mk II. New and improved, rated by my new guidelines!\
First of all, yes, I still dislike Cowboy Bebop, and even without rereading it I still remember the opening phrase from my first review. I'll refrain from it this time though, because at some point I stopped caring about whether I like that particular anime or not, I just want to give a\
          \
        fair rating.\
Story is for me defined by its Main Plot, the setting used, as well as the execution of the storyline.\
First, for the main plot. The most episodes are without any relevance to the main plot. They neither help to develop the cast, nor do they illustrate the setting. They are filler. Nothing more, and nothing less. And to be perfectly honest, I don't think its a viable option to spam filler after filler without even explaining what the anime is about. When I first watched this anime I lost interest after a mere 3 episodes and dropped it (For reference, by now I watched this anime like 3 times only for review reasons). But without filler episodes, what is actually left? A story which couldn't be more cliche. A story of two former friends, who fell in love with the same woman.\
Revenge, bloodlust... The usual stuff.\
As for the setting: To be honest, I don't have the most experience with science fiction, but I feel like this is one of the worst tries. The Ring travel system doesn't make sense in the slightest, nor do the spaceships. The first thing that comes to mind is Spikes space ship, the SWORDFISH II wouldn't be able to even navigate in space. Much less in the atmosphere. Well, crash and burn, Spike. I guess.\
Execution: I think I already mentioned that Fillers before the story isn't exactly the best way to hook the audience. As for the main story, I already said that it's a rather cliched one (everything beyond that would be spoiler). Well, you get the picture.\
So overall: We have a B-Movie storyline, sprinkled with fillers (1/3), a logically flawed setting (1/3), and a rather bad execution which never hooked me up (1/3). Overall 4/10 for the story.\
Next is the Artwork, which not just considers the Artworks for the characters, but also the background, as well as the fluency of animation (especially during battlescenes).\
To be blunt, compared to other anime of that time Cowboy Bebops artworks aren't anything bad. They do their job just fine without being groundbreaking or breathtaking.\
The backgrounds on the other hand are rather often undetailed, and I can even recall scenes in which parts of the screen were whited out (without being flashbacks). This leaves the animation, which is as always in Watanabes works, quite flashy, but only style and no substance. The choreography is pretty bad.\
Summing it up: The character artworks are up to par (2/3), while the backgrounds and animation are quite lackluster (1/3 for both). Overall 5/10 for art.\
For the sound I rate the voiceover (japanese dub only), as well as the OST/BGM, and the OP/ED. So, lets kick it off with the Voices. I don't really like the japanese cast, which, in my opinion, fail to express any feelings their characters might have. Without the video and subs I couldn't imagine whether the characters are sad, happy or whatever. Overall a pretty bad performance. The english cast on the other hand was pretty damn good, and I have to give credit to them, this is one of the best dubs I know. As for the OST I wondered why I couldn't remember even a single track. After rewatching an episode I knew: Because there is next to none OST most of the time. The few OSTs presented are more to underline the plot, but on their own don't really pack a punch. Lastly, the OP/ED Themes. I don't really like Blues to begin with, but I don't really feel like the theme fits Action-headhunter stuff too well. It felt more like some detective story or the like, at least to me. As for the ending 'The Real Folk Blues' fits way better and brings closure to each episode.\
Final scores for sound: Bad japanese cast which produces no feelings (1/3), next to nonexistant OST with forgettable tracks (1/3), and a mediocre OP, but okay ED (1/3).\
Sums up at 4/10 for sound.\
Characters should preferably have some catchy initial designs, good relations with their surroundings, and a good development. which is why I rate characters in there 3 categories.\
Initial designs: I don't think that Cowboy Bebop reinvented the wheel with their characters, but they fulfill their purpose. Jet as that cop who left the police to deliver justice on his own, the more or less sexy girl, and the easygoing main lead.\
Unfortunately I never felt like they had any relations with each other. None of their interactions with each other, but also with the surroundings felt real to me, because basically they had no counterparts they could greatly argue with.\
As for the development, quite honestly, I don't think that any of the characters had great development. Thinking bad I can't recall much of a development to begin with. The Spike from Episode 26 will act like the Spike from Episode 1. Or 4. Or which episode you want to choose.\
Same goes for most other characters, with only Faye being the exception.\
So overall the characters are rather disappointing, especially since they started with promising designs (2/3). But their Interaction was nonexistent (0/3), and the development was poor (1/3).\
Overall 4/10 for the cast of Cowboy Bebop.\
Enjoyment. Well, thats something everyone should decide for themselves. For me at least its a 1/10. Why? Because I answered these questions honestly:\
How much did I like the seen episodes (0-3)?\
How much do I want to see the story continue (0-3)?\
Would I recommend it to someone? (0=no, 1=yes)\
Would I watch it again, just for fun? (0=no, 1=once, 2=muiltiple times)\
Quite honestly, for me the obvious answer is No, no, and No! And No!\
Overall: Well 3,6 is pretty... bad. I don't like it, but if you do... Feel free to do so, thats called taste.\
Tl;dr: Forgettable story with lot of flaws and filler, acceptable artworks, rather weak OST and voiceovers, and a weak character development.\
I'm always open for feedback, thanks in advance!",

    Ok, I knew this was an episodic anime going into it. I'm not the biggest fan of those but with everything I've heard about the show and how great it is I decided to give it a go. First couple episodes were pretty good so I thought 'I can get through this.' Cut to ep. 15 and now I'm struggling to finish it. The sound and dub are amazing, I'm not denying that but the story suffers majorly here. There's no real over arcing story line other than Faye's story and Spike's and even then they are really only mentioned in the second half with\
          \
        everything else feeling like they're fillers. The animation was nice with it before the digitization age with it feeling dark and everything with no real noticeable flaws. \
When we first see Julia and thereafter, I couldn't of cared less about her even after everything. I knew nothing about her or anything. Spike's backstory was jammed into the last two episodes with a couple hints throughout the anime so when the final two episodes happened it just seemed out of the blue which might be why I was so annoyed at the ending. I thought that something else was going to happen and it didn't. \
I especially didn't care didn't care about Edward. When she left I couldn't help but cheer. What was the point to her character being on Bebop? I couldn't understand. Yes, she's a hacker but that's all. And the way she spoke rubbed me the wrong way and felt so childish and out of place in the show. Not to mention she wasn't there for very long so again, I wondered what her purpose there was. \
Faye was amazing. I know some people don't like her but I enjoyed her character especially after we learn parts of her backstory which made her more intriguing in my mind. Her character was consistent through the show but there was some character development which was nice (unlike Edward). I couldn't help but laugh at her and Spike going back and forth.\
Jet is an interesting one because even though he owns the ship Spike seemed to be the one in charge-most of the time. Jet will put his foot down and argue if he has to. There's a few other things that I can't think of right now but suffice to say I enjoyed him.\
Spike...pretty much a walking contradiction until the last couple episodes but I won't grip about that here. He can be ruthless but compassionate. He tells Faye to stop living in the past when that's all he does and so forth. \
The show down between him and Vicious felt cheap I'm not going to lie but it did. The very ending I wasn't expecting but again, I felt a but cheated with how quick everything went. If that story line was the over arcing one throughout the whole series and that finale was stretched to three episodes instead of two than I think it could have worked better and flesh out Vicious a bit more because I couldn't of care less when the fight was going on since he didn't really seem like a villain to me. Maybe it's because I didn't watch the movie but he didn't really do it for me as a bad guy. \
Overall, if you like Bebop that's good. I had trouble with it because it was so light humoured until the last couple episodes so the tone was everywhere and it was purely episodic. Not to mention some of the characters did it in for me so I can gladly say I watched it but probably won't be one I'll rewatch. \

    *Note just because I give it all 10s does not mean I believe that this is perfect. I just believe it is a masterpiece and I enjoyed it immensely.\"\
The 90s were a great time for anime. There was  DBZ, Yu Yu Hakusho, EVA, Sailor Moon etc. all were very good shows in their own right and garnered millions of fans worldwide. I am not here to talk about those, I here to talk about Cowboy Bebop, a timeless classic which was probably the reason why many people became interested in anime. Ah, I remember staying up until midnight, waiting for Cowboy Bebop to show\
          \
        up on Toonami. Ah the memories...............but I digress.\
Story- Now the revolves around a crew of space bounty hunters, whos main goal is to amass a large amount of money so they can live lavishly. It starts out with the main protagonist, Spike Speigel and his older buddy/pilot of their ship, Jet. Eventually, their crew expands to about 2 other people and also a dog. They go around the galaxy going on a bunch of crazy and wild adventures.\
The show is episodic. It is not like one hugeeee long arc about one thing; each episode focuses on a specific adventure that the crew goes on, or them trying to deal with their past. Sometimes you will see Spike battle a fat, sociopathic killer with amazing strength, and other times you will see characters reflect upon their past as a means of catharsis. But, at the very end you will witness one of the greatest endings in anime history. Ask anyone who has seen Cowboy Bebop, they will agree.\
Art- The art was very good for its time, and it even holds up well today. It is very crisp and you can tell from the detailed character drawings and ship designs. The show is also very \"western,\" themed, as in like Cowboys from the olden days. \
Sound- The soundtrack is amazing, it is a unique blend of jazz, blues, music-box etc. It is very eclectic to say the least. It is worthy of its widespread acclaim.\
Dub over sub for this one. This only do to one person, Steve Blum one of the greatest voice actors of all time. His performance as Spike is what made him what he his today.\
Character- It is probably one of the more popular casts in anime. First you have Spike, cynical, sarcastic bad ass with a shady past. Next, you have Jet Black, pilot of the Bebop and a grizzled ex-police officer. Third, you have Faye, sexy, and manipulative con woman. Fourth, you have Ed, the \
androgynous, whacky computer hacker. Lastly, we have the dog Ein, a Pembroke Welsh Corgi. This seemingly mis-matched group of rag tags, could not be more perfectly put together in my eyes.\
Overall I give this show a 10/10  because it in all honesty it is a great show to watch. I will say that some people may find it  to be boring, so don't  watch it if you don't like shows with a focus on dialogue. This is a show that you should recommend to anime newcomers.\

    Do you miss the days where outer space felt like a place where people went to work, did their laundry and lived their average lives, instead of a futuristic, chrome-plated, automated, flashing, beeping gadget? I certainly do. Titles like “Star Wars” made space feel like someplace that you might live someday, instead of a place where everything was shiny and new, and nobody ever had to do manual labor. Cowboy Bebop is on to something with the way it portrays outer space. At least, that’s what avid fans of the series may tell you.\
Being one of the more popular anime titles out there, does it\
          \
        really live up to all the hype? Hopefully, this review will answer some of those questions for you. Diehard fans of the series may not like some of the things that I’m about to say, just to give you fair warning.\
Story (4/10)—Whoa, hold on a second! Didn’t you just spend the first paragraph of this review praising the anime? Yes, people who inevitably will question me, I did. However, this particular chunk of the review won’t be so lavish with praise. \
Allow me to explain myself. The 4/10 makes it look like I hated this show. Let me assure you that I did not hate it.\
The story of Cowboy Bebop takes place, you guessed it, sometime in the future in outer space. It follows the adventures of a bounty hunter named Spike and his buddy, Jet, a fellow bounty hunter. While this sounds like a stereotypical journey through space boredom, it’s actually quite refreshing. Spike and Jet live in a space world that somehow reminds you of the old west. The entire start of the story just feels organic. You get a good sense of who the two characters are, and what they’re doing.\
So, why have I given the story such a low score? Well, quite simply, it was the startling lack of depth to the story that killed it for me. For the first several episodes, the show feels, well…episodic. There isn’t really a whole lot of story to connect the events of the first several episodes together. The only real common thread is Spike and Jet collecting bounty after bounty. Now, much to my surprise, this actually wasn’t a bad thing at first. I can deal with a few episodes where the plot isn’t apparent yet, if done well. And these episodes were! There were very good, and quite fun to watch! The atmosphere drew me in, the characters were intriguing, and the action was well-executed.\
However, as any viewer will, I eventually began to get curious about the past of the characters, and how they’ve come to be where they are now.  After a few episodes, you finally start to get a few painfully brief glimpses into Spike’s past as he comes face to face with an old enemy. However, this tension is quickly dropped in favor of some more episodic adventures.\
Fast forward another several episodes, and you get some more overarching plot involving this aforementioned villain. This particular adventure is split into two episodes, which got me very interested. However, the story drops the overall plot AGAIN and doesn’t pick it back up until the final two episodes. I really am not exaggerating, folks; aside from an occasional, brief flashback, the entire plot takes place in the space of about five episodes. \
So what are the other twenty-one episodes? Well, most of the other episodes are fun little adventures that involve some new villain every time, and put the characters in some sort of funny/amusing situation. Enough for some people, perhaps, but not for me. What really hooks me into a show is good, solid, well-planned plot. And Cowboy Bebop plain and simply failed to deliver. And on top of all that, the ending is…well, to avoid spoilers, let’s just say I didn’t care for it.\
Basically, I was sitting there frothing at the mouth, episode after episode, saying “Where’s the plot? When does the plot start to form?”. And then I was left with precious little plot at all, only to be disappointed by the ending. It’s like if you’re at a restaurant and they give you a salad, and I mean a really, REALLY delicious salad as an appetizer, but when you finish your salad and keep asking for the main course, they just give you more salad instead. Then, once you’re starting to get sick of salad, they hand you a stale pop-tart as dessert and send you on your way. What? Where’s all the good stuff that I came here for?\
That’s exactly how I felt at the end of Cowboy Bebop. I felt dissatisfied, and I felt like a great group of characters with good back stories, a very good atmosphere, an interesting villain, and some really solid action scenes had all simply gone to waste. I think that’s why I dislike the story so much. It got my expectations so high because the first few episodes were so good, only to disappoint me in the end.\
Art (10/10)—See? There WERE things I liked about this show!\
 Cowboy Bebop really is a gem among animation. Mind you, this anime was released in 1999, and the animation is STILL better than half of the stuff that’s released today. Every motion is fluid and smooth, and I never noticed any instances where the animation was lazy, or where the creators cut corners to save time or money. What really gets me is how some objects, like spaceships, were drawn without computer animation. Most animators will use computers to animate something with many moving parts, but not Cowboy Bebop. And in the instances where computer animation is used, it often took me several times to actually notice it.\
Everything about the animation in this show is superb, from the characters, to the background, to the dark color palette that makes up the show. There were times when I wanted to pause the video just so I could stop and look at all of the beautiful details in the background. All in all, the art creates a very convincing atmosphere that makes you feel like you really ARE in space with the characters. \
Sound (10/10) — I really don’t think you can find an anime with a better score than this one. I’m completely serious. I know that it’s a bold claim to make, but the music is absolutely sensational! Remember how I keep blabbing on about what great atmosphere this show has? Well, the music is largely a part of it. “Tank”, the opening theme, is one of the most popular opening titles in the history of anime, and nearly every other bit of music is as fun and addicting to listen to as the title. This is easily the strongest point of the show, and was a large part of what I enjoyed while watching it.\
For the first time, well…ever, I watched this series entirely in English. I was shocked to discover that the English dub of this show is VERY good. I’ve heard rumors that the creator of the show likes the English voices better than the Japanese, but I’m not certain of whether it’s true or not. In any case, you won’t be disappointed if you watch this show in English. I’ve never heard such a skilled cast of voice actors put together for any English dub, and never even once stopped and thought about the voice acting being poor. I can’t speak for the Japanese voices, but I’ve heard that those are quite good as well. No matter how you watch it, you’re not likely to be disappointed by the voice actors.\
Characters (6/10)—The first rule of creating any workable story is that the characters must be believable. And, largely, the characters of this show fit that mold. In addition to Spike and Jet, there are two other members that make it onboard to become part of the crew, and although these characters spend the majority of the time being annoyed with one another, you’ll still find yourself liking them and laughing at their dynamic they share. Each character gets at least one episode devoted to exploring their back story, which is a significant chunk of time, considering the short length of the show. \
Thus, each character was fleshed out very well by the end of the series, and I found myself caring about each of them, even the ones who had annoyed me at first. However, by the time the plot starts to wrap up in the last two episodes, I came to realize that the relationships between the characters weren’t really going anywhere. One character whom didn’t give a rip about Spike at the beginning, actually started to care whether he existed or not by the end. Spike doesn’t seem to care at all, and what could have made for a very interesting moment between two characters was thrown out the window when Spike walked away.\
I think my biggest reason for the low score was at the end, how so little emotional catharsis was achieved. Spike spends most of the series remembering a woman he loved, but the ending doesn’t really do much to take care of all that pent-up emotion. Even when Spike has that inevitable facedown with the villain at the end, I still didn’t feel like anything had really been achieved. Yes, I suppose the plot had technically been resolved, but what about my beloved characters? How do they react to all of this? Well, I hope you didn’t care about them, because the show never tells you.\
It’s that stale pop-tart showing up again. Not only do you get an unsatisfactory ending plot-wise, but the show NEVER tells you what happens to the other characters! Even if they had all died, I still would at least have known what happened to them. However, the ending focuses solely on Spike, and even what happens to him leaves a little room for interpretation and guesswork. I suppose that’s why I disliked the plot so much. I felt like the characters that I knew and loved weren’t done justice by the ending.\
Enjoyment (7/10)—This anime left me torn. I loved the music. I loved the art. I loved the characters. I even loved the first few episodes of the show, but I just felt like the ending let me down. Ultimately, I did enjoy the show, despite the many flaws I pointed out.\
Overall (7/10)—So now it’s time to answer the question I posed at the beginning: is this show overrated? My answer would be a tentative “yes”. While there are aspects of the show that I didn’t care for, namely the plot, I still really enjoyed it, and the music definitely lived up to the hype.\
Ultimately, I’d say this show is definitely worth watching. I just feel like whenever a show gets as much hype as this one does, people are bound to be disappointed once in awhile.",

    You've got be in a certain time at a certain place to appreciate Cowboy Bepop. It's sense of cultural mismatch doesn't excuse it's lack of identity. It pushes style over substance because there is no substance. It's constant homage to everything and anything muddies whatever originality it has.\
But at the same time, cowboys in space sounds cool right? Freeform jazz is cool too. Martial arts are cool. Are these the reasons the anime became so famous? Or is it because the 90s meant it had to be viewed on television at whatever time the channels chose to air Japanese cartoons, meaning that the sense of\
          \
        disconnect was covered up by genuine disconnection? Is it because it was the only good looking anime that could be watched - in English - without cringing?\
Perhaps it's my fault I didn't like Cowboy Bepop. Maybe it's because I chose to marathon it, going 3-4 episodes a day? Maybe it's because it's old? Maybe I'm simply not the target audience? During the duration I gave Cowboy Bebop, I was constantly trying to puzzle together why I didn't like it. Maybe it'll get better, I figured.\
The thing is that any logical conclusion I could think of didn't make sense. Other 90s anime include some of my all time favourites like Neon Genesis, Revolutionary Girl Utena and Serial Experiments Lain, so it's definitely not my lack of tolerance towards it's age. I've marathoned tons of shows, and if anything, that tends to make me enjoy them more. I love sci-fi.\
When I finally came to my senses, I finally rejected the idea that Cowboy Bepop is good. I accepted my own opinion, piercing through the thick armour of everybody else's, fuelled by rampant nostalgia and shielded by being overly sympathetic to the show's age.\
With most (x)-of-the-week shows, you figure out quite quickly whether you'll like them or not based on 1 or 2 episodes. I liked Bepop at first, I loved it's sense of style, with a Blade-Runner-like noir universe and fun jazz. But every episode had exactly the same format, with no connections between episode - no hook to make me care. The 20 minute runtime of the show meant that they nose-dived into introducing whoever they chase, they chase them and then they get paid. The action sequences were so drawn out that there wasn't any time for fickle character development or an underlying plot. \
Every single list discussing the best characters in anime includes one or two of these characters. After 16 or so mundane episodes, I just couldn't figure this one out. They're bland. Their interactions are cold and sterile with little chemistry. A sense of family was forced upon you, but it only served to remind how stereotypical and cliche Jet's caring side is. Faye's design makes her nothing more than sci-fi modified fanservice, and her character has very little going on inside. Ed is annoying.\
And then we come to Spike, who serves as the show's hero. He's a generic Marty Stu, who's too cool to care about. \
Cowboy Bepop amazes me, it really does. The aura of perfection is has, built solely on fond memories of small TVs and awkward schedules, is impressive. But if you take it out of context, the facade falls down. Cowboy Bepop is weekly trash and nothing more.\

    “Actually, it’s a very long and dramatic story,” – Jet Black (Episode 23)\
\9I don’t think there has been a stronger unity between a series and its protagonist than the dramatic 26-episode story of Cowboy Bebop and Spike Spiegel, a series that is exactly like its protagonist and a protagonist that is exactly like its series. For example, Goku was the ideal fit for Dragon Ball Z, a powerful young man known for screaming while in combat and (on a lesser note) for not being there when he’s needed the most; the series is also known for the same two things, the second one being that\
          \
        the series lacks in plot and characterization when it needs it the most. Another example I have is Master Keaton and the titular character of that series, Taichi Keaton. Taichi is a man who should be interesting due to him being a man of many occupations but he comes across as boring just like how the series itself should be interesting due to it being a Naoki Urasawa work but it also comes across as boring. However, I think no protagonist is more suited to a series than Spike Spiegel is to Cowboy Bebop. Spike is a bounty hinter with a past as a former gangster, a native of Mars always hungry for some quick cash. With his wispy dark green Afro and a cigarette in his mouth, Spike journeys from planet to planet in a stylish red fighter plane searching for criminals to apprehend. In the beginning of Cowboy Bebop, Spike was simply a rambunctious young man with dislikes galore and an unceasingly stubborn attitude. Throughout the series, my appreciation for our hard-smoking protagonist grew as Spike became someone who easily flowed between exuding laid-back charm and rugged intensity, as someone who matured to appreciate what he once disliked (kids, dogs, and women with attitude), and as someone who alternated between simple methods and extravagant approaches to solve problems. Actor Steve Blum knows, above all else, how to make a character interesting and Blum was at his all-time best in his role as Bebop’s beloved bounty hunter. Spike Spiegel, the “space cowboy” that the series consistently references, dominated every scene of Cowboy Bebop from the first (a black-and-white shootout) to the last (where Spike spoke one final word, fueling memories of Citizen Kane).\
“They are sick and tired of conventional, fixed style jazz,” – Words in Theme Song\
Jazz is the definitive sound of Cowboy Bebop, a genre of music closely associated with the word “cool”, and the jazzy songs in Bebop are far from one-dimensional, the songs a passion-filled combination of fast-paced and slow. Bebop’s soundtrack not only contains jazz; there’s also western-themed tracks, hard rock, hypnotic blues, soft rock with English lyrics (extremely rare in anime), and even some bongo beats. At one point, Cowboy Bebop ventures into the classical genre at one point by sampling a famous piece (Tchaikovsky’s “Waltz of the Flowers” in episode 11). The two things I love most about Bebop’s soundtrack are the theme song and the ending theme. “The Real Folk Blues” has the enviable honor of being Bebop’s ending theme, a soulful soft rock song accompanied by a collection of grainy black-and-white images (My favorite part of the ending theme is when the singer says “The re-al FOLK! Blues…” Powerful stuff, man). If you’re reading this review, I know you’ve heard Bebop’s legendary theme song already, an intense, fast-paced jazzy track with a blues guitar in the beginning and a hyperactive horn near the end. Of course, there’s more to Cowboy Bebop than the theme song but man, what a theme song it is!\
“Don’t leave things in the fridge,” – Spike Spiegel (Episode 11)\
The four main characters don’t merely leave their pasts in the fridge; they allow it to linger until it comes back to bite them. Jet Black is an ex-cop/bounty hunter and the pilot/mechanic of the ship Bebop, a gruff Russian cook with a soft spot. I think actress Wendee Lee delivered a much better performance as Bebop member Faye Valentine, a cigarette-smoking enigma with a gambling addiction, than she ever did as the soft-spoken voice of Azusa Fuyutsuki in Great Teacher Onizuka (Faye’s first scene in Cowboy Bebop is simply unbelievable). As much as I like Spike, Jet, and Faye, my favorite character in the series has to be the one and only Edward Wong Hau Pepulu Tivrusky the Fourth (‘Edward’ or ‘Ed’ for short), a skinny red-headed adolescent girl who specializes in computer hacking, talks in the third person, and injects a unique enthusiasm into every scene she’s in. Throughout the series, a plethora of supporting characters are brought to the fold, from a talking computer program to a homely, rock-loving trucker (The most interesting of these are a trio of elderly Hispanic bickerers that show up in the series again and again). There are also characters in Cowboy Bebop that only appear for one episode but receive more depth than characters in different series earn in a season, like the eccentric cowboy Andy, Mad Pierrot the flying psychopath, Wen the immortal harmonica player (the spiritual predecessor to Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood’s Pride), and Elisa, Jet’s former girlfriend. Cowboy Bebop is so phenomenal a series that even characters that don’t amount to much end up being celebrated as classic examples of characterization. Of course, I’m talking about Bebop’s main antagonist Vicious, a white-haired swordsman who never really stood out to me besides having a creepy voice. Other than Vicious, Bebop’s characters are well-acted, complex, and (above all) interesting.\
You could argue that Cowboy Bebop isn’t a great series because of its overly episodic plot, the unresolved issues of some of the side stories, and its lack of a legitimately great villain. These are all good points to use in an argument but I’d have two words for you: screw you. Cowboy Bebop is the rare anime series that combines multiple genres into one: mystery, space western, film noir, comedy, blaxploitation, action, philosophical drama, pulp fiction, and even horror (only in episode 20). Every great series has classic scenes but very few series contain scenes as poignant as the ones in Cowboy Bebop; there’s the Cathedral Fall Scene (where images of Spike’s past are revealed with beautifully creepy singing), the Hidden Film Scene (where a younger version of a certain character encourages the viewer in what’s easily the most heartbreaking scene of Bebop), and the Final Fight scene (where Spike finally confronts his past by blowing away his enemies in dramatic fashion), these three scenes distinguishing themselves from the others. Even the episode previews are great, from Spike’s hilarious rant in the episode 6 preview to Jet’s critical review in the episode 18 preview, from Faye’s glorifying speech about love in the episode 15 preview (much to Spike and Jet’s displeasure) to Mad Pierrot’s unforgettable laughing in the episode 20 preview, and (my personal favorite) Edward’s announcement that the series is over during the episode 12 preview. While watching this series, the one thing that confused me the most was the issue of the characters running in motion during the theme song. “Why are they doing this?” I asked myself. Then I figured, “Maybe they too are trying to watch Cowboy Bebop.”",

    Cowboy Bebop. Perhaps the greatest anime TV show created thus far. It's a massive mixture of genres, but is mostly sci-fi, comedy and action with a western vibe and a touch of film noir.\
The story of Cowboy Bebop, or the lack thereof, is probably the weakest link to the series. This series does not have an ongoing story. However, the story is NOT the main focus of the show. Each episode can stand on its own.\
The main focus is the immense variety of entertainment that this show provides. Many episodes are done in a different style. Some are dedicated to character development (what I call\
          \
        the chill-out episodes), some are dedicated to character back-story (each main character gets about 2 or 3), some are dedicated to pure action and fun, while some are psychological thrillers or even social commentary.\
The second main focus is the characters. Each main character is very well developed by the end of the series. It seems that the creators found the perfect kind of characters that would compliment the crew of Bebop. And what's this perfect formula? Contrast. Each character in the crew of Bebop has a very unique personality. Putting characters that do not fit together creates very interesting and funny situations, indeed.\
The music is top-notch in this show. It ranges from jazz, funk and bebop to pop, classic rock and choir singing. Very memorable and compliments the scenes well.\
By the time you finish this series, you will probably remember many of the times where the crew were just hanging out, living their everyday life. I think these scenes are what make the show. It wouldn't be the same without this contrast to the action throughout the show.\
Overall I give Bebop a 10 out of 10. It's extremely enjoyable; the production design is amazing, and it has lovable and memorable characters, as well as amazing music that perfectly compliments the show.\

    Spike Spiegel is a bounty hunter with a dark, violent past. Nowadays, he roams between the seedier colonies of space along with his partner Jet Black and their spaceship Bebop as they try to catch a bounty or two, barely making a living at it. Some of their bounties, like the mysterious Faye Valentine and the intelligent 'data dog', Ein, end up as fellow partners. Is Spike trying to justify prior misdeeds by working for the right side of the law? What will happen when his past catches up to him? And what of the pasts of his fellow shipmates? Will any of them survive\
          \
        long enough to find out? \
Cowboy Bebop has been often referred to as the new anime noir, a title that does fit, but doesn't even begin to fully describe it. Equal parts film noir, spaghetti western, and 70's cop show; Cowboy Bebop is both retro and fresh at the same time. A very stylish, beautifully crafted series that deserves much more attention than it gets. If ever there was a series more deserving to be a sleeper hit, Bebop is it.\
Cowboy Bebop is well suited to TV. Each episode manages to stand alone, but at the same time link together an overall larger story. Even if you only see two or three episodes, not exactly in order, one wouldn't be lost, and would find enjoyment in them. In order to truly appreciate it, though, one must see it through.\
Cowboy Bebop also presents a realistic view of the future. Spike and Jet travel in what to us would be a highly sophisticated craft, but to them is the modern day equivalent of a 1976 El Camino. The places they visit are far from what one would expect. Instead of Neo-Tokyo with its shiny, impossibly tall skyscrapers that never end, we have Neo-Tijuana, with its dusty dirt roads, run down shacks and migrant workers. Space is ethnic, but not in the Star Trek sanitized for the sake of politically correctness way. Each colony reflects a melting pot more akin to Los Angeles or New York City than any Blade Runner wannabe ever could.\
This striving for realism also is reflected in the character designs. Spike is lanky and handsome in his own way, but by no means is he a slender pretty boy. Faye is sexy and curvy, but she's no large breasted bimbo. Jet is burly, not fat, and has traits that would make one think he is of Russian descent. Ein can easily be recognized as a Welsh corgi, and not just another undistinguishable mutt. The only one who looks remotely like a 'cartoony' character is Ed, and even then no one would ever mistake her as anything -but- a scrawny preteen tomboy. (And to see her name and appearance, you'd think she just got off the boat from the Philippines.)\
The animation is beyond superb. Its quality excels over most current releases. Cowboy Bebop uses computer graphics, but does so in such a fluid, breathtaking manner. There are practically no scenes that feel 'artificial', like what's going on in the foreground is totally separate from the background. Many computer-generated anime can't seem to shake the look that the characters are just floating in front of the background stills. Everything in Cowboy Bebop seems to breathe with life and motion, even in otherwise stoic scenes, and it's a rarity and a marvel to behold.\
Another bonus Cowboy Bebop has going for it is the soundtrack. Yoko Kanno scores (literally) again with her work for this series. The opening theme alone is already one of *the* best intro pieces I have ever heard. The blend of jazz and blues is absolutely perfect in setting the mood of the series. I ask you, has this woman ever -done- any bad music? (Of course not!)\
Then there's the storyline. Even though each episode stands quite well on its own, with poignant moments interspersed with exciting action, the underlying theme of Spike Spiegel and his motivations for what he does is absolutely intriguing. With each flashback, you get one more piece of the puzzle, from Spike's shady origins to the loves that influenced the way he is. Maybe his bounty hunting is really a search for identity as much as a way of life he has chosen. The plot and characterization in Cowboy Bebop have a sophistication and subtlety that is practically one-of-a-kind. It's hard to find movies this involving, much less animated television series. Cowboy Bebop simply puts most anime...and Hollywood, to shame.\
On the surface, it's easy to dismiss as '70s retro fluff. \"Hey, there's Vega$ all over again!\" And yes, many a Japanese and American movie star or feature is lampooned in one form or another during each episode. Cases in point: Spike Spiegel is a postmodern Lupin III. And in the first episode alone, Asimov Sorenson and Katarina.... can we say Desperado, kids? (Heck, even Quentin Tarantino seems to have a cameo!) But beneath that noir veneer is a very human drama that has just enough humor and clever dialogue to be realistic, yet highly entertaining. This is a must-have for any serious collector of Japanese animation.\
Simply put, this anime is one of the best. \

    As an avid movie watcher and music lover, Cowboy Bebop was the first anime I've ever seen, with the perspective that I was about to see an anime. Of course, before this experience, I had already watched stuff like Dragon Ball or Doraemon, but those don't really count, because I never really watched them from a critical and artistic point of view. From the time I first finished Cowboy Bebop, I've watched several other anime and even rewatched Cowboy Bebop a second time. Because Cowboy Bebop is so special, both on a personal level and as an anime, I will be using an unconventional order\
          \
        to review it.\
\
----- Soundtrack (10) -----\
I've heard many skeptics say to me that Cowboy Bebop is a silly name for a show, and that it drives them away from watching it. I completely disagree with these opinions, as I think the name Cowboy Bebop is the perfect name in regards to the show's soundtrack. If you heard a fragment of the soundtrack, you'll probably know what I am talking about. The bebop part emphasizes the jazzy influences of this amazing soundtrack (Bebop is a style or variation of jazz), Cowboy epitomizes all the adventures that this musical masterpiece will bring you.\
With over 6 hours of absolutely splendid tracks, if you truly enjoy music, you'll be sure to never forget this soundtrack. Tracks like Spokey Dokey, Space Lion, Waltz for Zizi or Farewell Blues are some of the absolute masterpieces to be found among the rest of the equally excellent songs.\
The true motivation for me to watch Cowboy Bebop was the grand opening, Tank. Some years ago, Cowboy Bebop was running on my television and from time to time I would listen to the mystical theme song, that wouldn't leave my mind for a long time. This truly inspired me to delve into the world of anime.\
I have yet to find a soundtrack as influential and as inspiring as Cowboy Bebop's. No movie, series or anime will provide you with such an outstanding selection of songs. Even if you haven't watched Cowboy Bebop yet, I strongly recommend that you explored the music behind it, even though all of these songs become much more meaningful if you actually watch Cowboy Bebop.\
\
----- Animation (9) -----\
In my opinion, this is the only aspect of Cowboy Bebop that is not flawless. This, of course, doesn't remove the fact, that the art department of Cowboy Bebop is still very good, considering its age and the fact the it is mostly hand drawn. Having this in mind, everything looks damn good. However, some of the CGI didn't age very well (even though it is good CGI for the era) and some of the secondary characters could have been given a better look to match their great persona. This isn't the rule, and it certainly doesn't affect the show overall, but it does happen one or two times (Udai Taxim, I am looking at you).\
One of the things I've liked about Cowboy Bebop was the fights. You rarely get lost in the action like many shows and they are usually smoothly animated and very enjoyable.\
All in all, Cowboy Bebop looks pretty darn good and its visuals certainly match the rest of the theme going on.\
\
----- Story (10) -----\
The story of Cowboy Bebop is not an easy one to explain to people who have never seen it. This is mostly because Cowboy Bebop presents a multitude of small stories that build the individual stories of Cowboy Bebop's main characters. It is common for the people who haven't watched Cowboy Bebop to think the show is about some western showdown, but this certainly is not the case. To clear any misconceptions, our main cast consists of bounty hunters and not cowboys. The only true cowboy is Andy, a character who appears late on the show.\
I would like to sum up some of the aspects explored in Cowboy Bebop:\
1 - The entirety of the series happens in the future at our solar system. One of the fascinating things about Cowboy Bebop is how much our solar system has changed and how you would think human's old habits would be extinct after evolving into a interplanetary civilization. Cowboy Bebop is the story of an expanding and never learning human society.\
2 - Cowboy Bebop follows the adventures of a crew of struggling bounty hunters. They are bounty hunters by chance and not choice as you will quickly learn. Together they roam our solar system in hopes of cashing bounties. Cowboy Bebop is the story of The Bebop spaceship.\
3 - There is a man merely living a dream. Cowboy Bebop is the story of a man trying to wake up from that dream and get the life he once promised to himself.\
I could go on and on writing about all of these things happening on Cowboy Bebop's universe, but these are just some of the more relevant ones.\
Lastly, I'd like to add the amazing endings that of most of the episodes have. One could easily compare the format of Cowboy Bebop to that of short stories. A typical episode builds up to great climax and resolution, with lyrical prowess.\
Everything in Cowboy Bebop is there for a reason. All the dialogues are meaningful, everything has its place and symbolic reason. The best way to describe Cowboy Bebop is that it is a truly amazing and artistic adventure.\
\
----- Characters (10) -----\
I could go on and speak about the characteristics of the main characters, but that really isn't necessary, because as soon as you start watching Cowboy Bebop you understand what they are all about. What really matters is why they act the way they do. What motivates their actions? Why did they end up being bounty hunters? These are questions that are covered perfectly, to say the least. I think one of the best experiences of Cowboy Bebop is you getting to know the crew and not having other people present them to you, so I won't write about these characters, as I think getting to know them is part of the magic of Cowboy Bebop. However, I should praise the supporting cast of Cowboy Bebop. Even though most of the supporting cast rotates and ends up making only one appearance, it is truly amazing how much depth and personality that these characters have. Hell, even the Big Shot presenters are really nice characters!\
Funnily, when I discuss Cowboy Bebop with other people, I always get a different answer in regards to who their favorite characters were. Cowboy Bebop is one of the few shows that can achieve this sort of phenomenon and I can safely say that it will provide you with some of the best characters in any art media.\
\
----- Enjoyment/Last Thoughts (10) -----\
If you couldn't already tell, I really enjoyed Cowboy Bebop. It was a completely refreshing experience for me, as someone who was used to watch a lot of movies. As many have said it before, there is always something to be enjoyed by everyone in Cowboy Bebop. Even if you don't enjoy it as much as I did, I am sure you will at least like Cowboy Bebop, unless you are completely insensitive to art, because that is what Cowboy Bebop is - a masterpiece.\
What I am about to say is a bit harsh, but it is true. I respect a lot of opinions, but one that I can't respect at all is that Cowboy Bebop isn't good or that they didn't like it. People who present you with this opinion are not only insulting their own intellect, but also probably didn't watch the entirety of Cowboy Bebop or didn't understand (which isn't hard) what Cowboy Bebop is about. If those aren't the answers you are probably talking to a very shallow and intellectually lacking person, but then again, these people should never be given your friendship. Yes, this is how much Cowboy Bebop means to me and to a lot of people. This is how good Cowboy Bebop is.\
\
----- Should you watch it? -----\
Absolutely. However, you need to take an artistic approach to the series, as, unlike many other popular anime, Cowboy Bebop is not completely linear and it provides a more balanced experience of action and story development.\

    This is the quintessential anime. Yes, you heard it. The perfection in every way.\
A one time in a lifespan journey. A diamond in the anime world. A chest full of gold buried in a very deep hole that everyone forgot about. This is Cowboy Bebop.\
By the year of 2014, many people would rather watch One Piece or SAO or whatever they watch thats new, instead of watching Cowboy Bebop since its outdated to say the least. It doesn't have a sharp animation and the drawing is no way near what it is today. Well, if you think like this, then fuck you. You don't deserve\
          \
        to experience what this masterpiece has to offer. The other ones who can get past its look, be sure that the reward is higher than that.\
Cowboy Bebop doesn't follow a typical story, which only adds to its uniqueness. Its episodic and that means every episode = a new story to be told in this MASSIVE universe. Its strange how no one wants to do another series in this universe, not following the past characters. But i can understand that, because no one will repeat the succes of what Shinichiro Watanabe and Yoko Kanno did. Nonetheless, every episode is interesting and i wasn't bored a single time.\
The Art is amazing, but i can see that someone will not like it. Well, good then.  The future is still very believable and i'd rather have this future than Star Wars and such.\
The Sound is as good as it gets. Seriously. No other anime has what CB has packed in 4 discs i believe. The Jazz... enough words.\
The Characters deserve a special spot in my soul. I will always remember the charming Spike, experienced Jet, lost Faye and crazy Ed.\
This is without a question, the best anime out there. Go watch it right now. You can thank me later.\

    Cowboy Bebop was not the first anime I had ever watched, which looking back probably hurt my enjoyment of the series. I had been spoiled with other action/drama series that had a much better flow to the overall story, Trigun being a prime example. Cowboy Bebop for the most part scatters plot important episodes around the series, most others being ether filler or character focused. Now I'm not complaining about filler episodes, I to a certain extent I love them since they can take more liberties to be unique in various ways. My gripe is with character-focused episodes, because they're so boring I had to\
          \
        attempt to watch a few of them more than once not having the care to finish it the first time. The problem is that these episodes are slow, usually take up most of the screen time with just a single main character, and have an addiction to flashbacks / somber moments. It's not the worlds biggest problem, there are only about 5 episodes like this, and 2 others that are debatably so it's not a capital offence.\
I mostly only have good things left to say about the show, and if you've heard anything about it you already know what I'm going to say. The animation is exceedingly good, hand drawn and beautiful. The jazz soundtrack is iconic and is frequently compared to others that are like it. Most of the characters are memorable and interesting (excluding Ed, I have zero clue why people like her).\
As a closing I'll give both a compliment and a criticism. I really liked episodes that kept the amount of science fiction elements to a minimum, not talking about space ship type stuff, I mean uploading souls to the internet. The show is at it's best when it keeps it's noir feel and collapses when it goes Star Trek. Most episodes sticks to the noir, but every once in a while you feel like you put on the wrong series.\

    The short ass review:\
I love this show. 10/10\
The actual review: \
I love me some 90's anime, its quite good. I could go on for ages on how much I goddamn love this show. I could be a grown ass man by the time I'm done. But instead, I'll give a short 5 paragraph version of why I love this show.\
Cowboy Bebop takes place in space with 2 bounty hunters (Spike & Jet) making cash off killing people. Later on they find a bad-ass women (Faye), a person who still after 17 years, nobody has any idea of it's sex (Edward) and a goddamn dog. We're\
          \
        given enough information to work with for these characters as we meet them. It's not too much nor too little. As the show goes on, we delve deeper and deeper into the characters as we learn about their pasts. And that's really what the show revolves around, the history of a bounty hunter (Spike Spiegel) who has done a lot of bad shit which I won't talk about cause duh, spoilers. But it is real emotional. It even gets emotional for the other characters.\
I love every character in this show, extra, side, main, doesn't matter. Each character has a personality and a backstory to them. Spike is a wise man with badass karate moves, life lessons and generally a backstory to cry over. Jet, man, who doesn't wanna be this guy? He's just cool and chill, he gets the job done, handles situations. Just a cool character. Faye Valentine is really a broken character who is trying to learn her past. And when you do learn it, you feel so sad for this character. Edward is wacky and love them. Enough said.\
The animation is really well done even for a  1999 anime. For being some of the last anime to use hand drawn animation, it really is impressive. The music, ah. Man, the music. It's a mix of jazz and blues. Fuck me it's amazing. Each track is filled to the brim with amazing music. The opening is orgasmic and the ending is calming and just a beauty. \
Overall, this show is just bad-ass. That's the one word I can say about this show. It has good storytelling, likable characters, superb animation and orgasmic music. If I can say a couple of minor issues. The first 4 episodes are extremely slow paced and try to introduce you to the show, but trust me. It sure may be a little boring, but after those 4 episodes. Episodes 5 & 6 are simply not only some of the best episodes of the show, but the best episodes in all of anime and TV. That's the only complaint I have with this show. So please, do yourself a favor and go watch this masterpiece. Also, watch the English dub, this is one of the only times I prefer dub over sub.\

    Even back in my high school years, when I used to catch a random episode of Cowboy Bebop on Adult Swim, and I would be thoroughly entertained.\
Now, as an adult, I have come to appreciate this anime even more. Cowboy Bebop is not an anime that follows today's \"Let's make everyone pretty, and kill a dramatic scene by throwing an iron pan at someone's head\". Cowboy Bebop, to me, is the essence of what a great anime is.\
Even though the show's main storyline is only truly there through a small handful of episodes, each episode leaves the viewer thoroughly entertained. Each character gets their moment\
          \
        in the sun, so to speak, with some intriguing info on their backstory (usually in the form of an episode) that left me completely glued to the screen.\
Awesome soundtrack (I still have it on my playlist to this day) , paired with great characters and well written episode to episode stories, leave the viewer wishing more anime out there did the same thing.\
I found it shocking that this anime was not listed in the top 3. Cowboy Bebop still has great rewatch value for me (maybe every couples years or so, but it's there) . Drama, Comedy, Action, all perfected.  I feel this anime definitely deserves to be listed in the greatest anime of all time. \

    Shinichirō Watanabe's badass space western Cowboy Bebop prepares viewers for an exciting adventure of the galaxy's hottest new frontiersmen. As an intricately crafted composition of natural characters, passionate music, dark tones, and relatable themes, this epic stands the test of time as one of Japanese animation's finest masterpieces.\
Story (read the synopsis first!)\
Structurally, episodes, throughout the series and hereafter referred to as \"sessions\", focus on isolated events, pertaining either to a particular bounty, backstory, or random \"filler\" event. Fans of stories that are less structured and more character oriented will be satisfied in that sense, as the main plot of Spike's conflict with crime lord Vicious\
          \
        and the Red Dragon crime syndicate appears in tight bursts throughout the series. However, despite the disjointed pattern, the series flows in a way that leaves the viewer feeling satisfied and never disconnected from any particular character.\
A welcome positive of the writing is the no-holds-barred attitude the writers take in regards to the plot. The world of Bebop is a harsh, unforgiving world, and even down to the gritty end we find that no single character is safe. Though at times you may feel emotionally pained over a decision they made, in the end you'll understand it was the right one to make.\
Despite most episodes being good fun, Cowboy Bebop thematically provides a strong insight into the nature of isolation, purpose of existence, and consequences of the past. Spike is the principal instrument used by writers to convey thematic discourse, though mirrors of this behavior is seen in equally troubled partners Faye and Jet as well. Without spoiling too much, know that you'll view the deeply human struggles of the protagonists (and antagonists) with an air of familiarity and understanding.\
Genre and Characteristics\
Now, we can't be having \"cowboys\" and \"bounties\" without a little action, can we? Cowboy Bebop is a western by design, and with that comes adventure, hardship, and yes, fighting. Between hand-to-hand combat, bar fights, cosmic dogfighting, and katanas (yes, fucking katanas), a viewer's bloodlust will consistently be sated through the variety of action scenes present. Honestly, for the time in which this series was released, you'll be thoroughly impressed by how awesome everything looks.\
As the series is set in a futuristic version of today's galaxy, science fiction plays an integral part in world development. Spaceships and hyperspace gateways replace most of today's logistics of automobiles and highways. Earth has been made mostly inhabitable, and as a result, humans live mostly on other planets in the solar system (notably Mars). Each planet retains its own personality and atmosphere, shown vibrantly through the respective color palettes, architecture, and populations. Multi-culturalism is heavily prevalent throughout the locales, with regions mimicking that of Tijuana, New York, or Beijing. Telebroadcasts are often noted as being available in multiple languages, leading us to believe there is a sense of globalism and unity throughout the galaxy. Watanabe's colonized galaxy certainly does create an interesting perspective of what the future for humanity may be like.\
Animation\
Surprisingly enough, Cowboy Bebop retains animation quality advanced for its time. Watanabe and Sunrise Studios overall proved themselves throughout as being able to maintain a high standard of quality. There's a certain amount of fluidity present within most motions, and characters react naturally and often under a given circumstance.\
I found myself constantly in awe with was how stellar (no pun intended) the cinematography was throughout the anime. Watanabe understood how vital camera shots were to conveying what was to be expressed. When new locales are introduced, there was a frequent use of panning long shots to convey the relative size of the world. A juxtaposition is formed between the characters and the world, showing how insignificant humanity is to the greater above, tying in well with the thematic tone of the anime. Atmosphere is never in question with how masterfully each one is produced. Color tones, camera angles, and character placement all help to convey the intended feeling of a shot.\
One of the common \"sins\" found within anime is that the \"show, don't tell\" rule is often disregarded in favor of a dialogue driven exposition. The latter is true for Cowboy Bebop, as we learn of the lore of the future galaxy through visually seeing it. For example, despite being a civilization that has managed space travel, there are still many pockets of poverty present as evident in many episodes. Spike's mysterious past is never spoken out in detail, rather throw short, ambiguous flashbacks that form the pieces to a greater puzzle. There's a certain degree of interactivity present that gives the viewer a stronger connection than had he or she just been explicitly lectured.\
Sound\
I can't think of very many other titles, save maybe for the cousin of Samurai Champloo, that have soundtracks as distinctly stylized as Cowboy Bebop's. Loyal to the name, jazz is the specific theme that composer Yoko Kanno intended for the series, and it's a theme that fits well. The spirit of expression, improvisation, passion, and divergence is indeed the character of Cowboy Bebop. Kanno masterfully utilized the tracks at fitting times throughout the series, greatly emphasizing the intended tone of a scene. One of the greatest analogies I can think of would be how well Susumu Hirasawa organized the abstract composition for Berserk ('97-98).\
The voice acting, as is to be expected with such a critically acclaimed series, is fantastic. Cowboy Bebop is one of the few animes that can proudly say it has a dubbed version, so it is the viewers choice which version they'd like to hear. Personally, though this may conflict with most western enthusiasts, I prefer the Japanese voice actors.\
Both the opening and ending tracks, \"Tank!\" and \"The Real Folk Blues\", respectively, are my all-time favorites. Kanno knew well how to begin and end the series, as the former gets you hyped up to all hell and the latter leaves you a pensive, emotional wreck. Ready yourself.\
Characters\
If the world is the framework, the soundtrack the soul, and the animation the paint, Bebop's characters must be the muse. Cowboy Bebop is uniquely designed in that the story forms around the characters rather than the opposite. A certain amount of incredulity is eliminated when characters are written so well they speak as normal people. Watanabe didn't want to spin a tale, rather relay an epic of five adventurers.\
To that end, we don't see the crew as tools of a story, rather a group of friends that could be considered a family (albeit fairly dysfunctional). Spike is our flawed but lovable antihero, Jet his hardworking, moralistic foil. Faye the seductive femme fatale with a tendency for certain vices. Edward is our eccentric but useful hacker, and Ein the intelligent pupper. They're a ragtag bunch, but damn it, they work well together, and you grow to love them with each session.\
Enjoyment\
Needless to say, Cowboy Bebop was a wild ride. Session after sessions, my satisfaction never wavered. There's a certain richness to this series that gets you drunk off it, always lusting for another bounty.\
Part of what made the show so fun for me was its westernized tone. While in Japan this may have been seen as foreign and intriguing, for those of us in the West, we see this as familiar and welcoming. Cowboys are kind of our thing, you know? Seeing a skillfully written Japanese perspective on what entails a \"space cowboy\" presents a fun experience for us western folk. It's funny how on both sides of the coin it can be a positive.\
Conclusion\
The things that come to mind when I recall this anime come easily: cigarettes, smirks,  and woolongs. Funny how the slightest things can leave the biggest imprints, but that's exactly the intended effect. Be it the down-to-earth characters, comprehensive universe, or passionate scoring, the \"new genre itself\" Cowboy Bebop never leaves your heart. Even fifty-four years from now, no matter what new series are critically acclaimed, people will come back to and relive the experiences of that work with the same spark of excitement and adventure they once beared. We've all got a little space cowboy in us.\

    Cowboy Bebop is one of the few series that got recommended to me by both my real life friend and my net friends. I really wanted to like this show, I was so excited to watch this and my expectations were at an all time high which is what led me to dub cowboy bebop as the most disappointing anime ever\
There are definitely worse, much worse series out there of course but I never expected much from them. Cowboy bebop however, is one of the most loved anime and everything I heard about it was positive which ultimately led me to expect Cowboy Bebop to\
          \
        be an masterpiece that cannot be hated by anyone. Boy was I wrong\
Well, that's enough of that, let's get on with my review\
Story:\
Cowboy Bebop is episodic for the most part and what's worse is that it's pretty much in the monster of the week format. There are a lot of standalone episodes in the series that aren't really important but they tried to force it at the end. I didn't like most of the standalone episodes but I hated what they did at the end even more\
Characters:\
They were able to give the most of the main cast a believable back story which properly explained why they acted the way they did. Not much of Ed's past is revealed though like why she even knew how to hack and what motivates her to act the way she does. They could've inserted that anywhere given how much standalone episodes they have but they didn't\
Art and Animation:\
I don't really mind the art style but some of the scenes just took me out of the anime because of how terribly animated they were but this can be forgiven because this is a 90s anime. The animation for the wormholes in particular were absolutely nauseous \
Sound:\
I'm not a fan of Jazz so I have nothing to say about the music\
\
Enjoyment:\
This is one of the few anime where I actually had to push myself just to finish. I usually just drop them but given how highly acclaimed the series I held on unto hope that maybe, just maybe the next episode would be better and it wouldn't bore me out of my mind but no, that didn't happen and when I finished this series, I was just glad that it was finally over and I can finally watch something that I actually like. This series was boring from start to finish, the only exception being episode 8, the sole episode that I like\
Overall:\
It's not as good as people make it out to be and it failed to live up to my expectations but most importantly, and when I say most importantly, I mean that this is the only part that matters for me, it was boring and I didn't enjoy it which is why I'm going to give this a 6. \
Oh hey I just checked but my overall score for Cowboy Bebop is still a 6 if i take the average of my scores for it's separate aspects. 6.25 if I didn't count my score for the music (I divided it by 4 ofc, I'm not that dumb)\
I don't think numbers can properly convey how much you like or dislike a show so take this sentence as my rating:\
It still had some bits that I enjoyed but it was really boring as a whole. \
P.S. This is ofc just my opinion so don't send me death threats for this, okay? Cool?\

    Imagine Bruce Lee and Quentin Taratino's love child grew up and decided to make an anime after viciously fighting tigers in a jungle with nothing but a sharp stick. Ladies and gentlemen, that anime would be Cowboy Bebop. I often view Cowboy Bebop as the \"devil\" of anime. Not because it's particularly bad, but in fact it's quite the contrary. When you sign a deal with the devil, what happens? You get what you want, and the devil gets your soul. And in this case, you get the best entertainment you'll ever have in your life, but your soul is now being vastly devoured by\
          \
        anime shows. \
Story: 9/10 - Cowboy Bebop is a bit different than other anime because it's plot vastly depends on the episodes (rather than it being a continuous plot throughout the series), to the point where it kinda mirrors a lot of American cartoons in it's story telling format. However, I still do HIGHLY recommend you watch all the episodes. Not only are all of them tremendously entertaining, but a lot of elements from certain episodes come back later as important plot. The overarching plot is pretty simple, the show follows two partners: Spike and Jet who've had rough pasts and run off to become space bounty hunters in a future society where inter-planetary travel isn't just possible, but also widely used. Overtime there spaceship (the Bebop) gains more and more members: A women with and attitude (Faye), a corgi with enhanced intelligence (Ein), and a superhacker (Who is just a little girl with SEVERE ADHD named Edward). \
Art: 10/10 - The art itself especially deserves praise because Cowboy Bebop came out before digital animation was widely used... and it's STILL better animated than a hell of a lot of modern anime. The fight scenes are still very fluid for it's time and still holds up to the very day. \
Sound: 10/10 - Want to hear the best fucking dub in existence? Look no further than Cowboy Bebop. This show has vastly been considered to have the best dub in anime history, and it came out an era where not much was expected in the dubbing process. As for the soundtrack? Well, Cowboy Bebop relies heavily on it's music as it's loaded with jazz/blues. And if you're a music fan this anime is LOADED with classic rock references... try and see if you can guess them all. \
Character: 9/10 - All the main characters that I listed above were all very dynamic and lovable in their own right, but my one and only problem with the characters are the side characters. A lot of times you'll get a very interesting side character who only gets 20 minutes of screen time, and you'll never see him/her... again. However, ALL the main characters are amazing in every way, shape, and form. Spike and Jet are total bad-asses, Faye makes a great seductress for the show (and has a very interesting back story), and Edward is one of the greatest comic reliefs in anime history. Not to mention fucking Vicious, the main antagonist of the show who trained beside Spike. \
Enjoyment: 10/10 - One of the many things that makes Cowboy Bebop so interesting is the fact they are willing to laugh at subjects that most anime wouldn't DARE to touch. Drugs (The Shroom episode... oh god the shroom episode), sex, transvestites, gruesome murders, gambling, and humans who have been heavily experimented on... this anime has 'em all! There is no such thing as limits when it comes to this show, because limits are for pussies! I personally found every single episodes filled with entertainment that had me hooked from start to finish.\
This show is not called a classic because it's made in the late 90's, it's called a classic because it fucking deserves the title. If you are looking for a show that steps beyond the boundaries of other anime, and a show where just watching it will cause your chest hair to grow by about 3 inches, than Cowboy Bebop is the show for you! Overall: 9.5/10\

    Cowboy Bebop. The show that makes you feel so bad ass you rob a bank, kill a hooker, and inject steroids right into your cock! The show that will have you sayin see you space cowboy after every episode and right when the credits roll you start up the next episode like the fat piece of glorious shit you are. I know im a lil late to the party but I wanted to review this gem since it's one of my favorites and all. So lets get into the review ladies, gentlemen, transgenders, and all people who identify as a trans queer Doppelganger Mc Flurry\

Story:\
In all honesty I didn't get into Cowboy Bebop for it's story line, sure it was there but that's not what drew me in, it was the action baby! This isn't to say the story is bad I loved how it was episodic. In fact for it's time this was something unique and different. I liked how every episode was a different adventure and it felt fresh with new and amazing characters and new people joining the main crew and sort of becoming a family of sorts if you wanna call it that. The only gripe I had was that the ending felt sort of unsatisfying for me and this really is just my opinion but I felt like it was sort of rushed and what I mean is that end fight with Vicious felt lame af, how you gonna let that nigga kill you and you got a pistol when he had a close range weapon? You managed to get a shot on that fool! He wasn't invincible and you could of brought a machine gun up in there and blasted his ass sky high! Naw im playin it was a good ending, the bang at the end was cool and all that shit. 9/10\
\
Art:\
The animation was fantastic, you aren't gonna get anything this good these days. Now most shit consists of low budget CGI (Im looking at you berserk 2016!), I feel like all anime looks alike nowadays (THATS RACIST) but it's like everything is drawn so cutesy, one reason I can't watch DBZ Super even tho i really want to just the dub needs to hurry the fuck up, Japs voices always trigger my great grandpas PTSD so i can't watch it. But anyways the art is great, love Fayes Tits. 9/10\
\
Sound:\
The voice acting and musical score in this show is godly. It's like experiencing sex with Sophia Vergara while Beyonce makes out with you and Lisa Ann fondles your ball sack and fingers your butt hole all at once! Never have I heard English voice acting this good not even today. It all sounds like shit with a few exceptions here and there like a minor bit of Funimations work but it still doesn't compare. And that lovely Jazz music is the cherry on top of this beautiful sundae. 10/10\
\
Characters:\
Spike has to be one of my favorite MC's of all time. He's in my top 10 list and for good reason. Who doesn't love a space bounty hunter with a dark past and a humorous attitude? Jet's also a cool dude who can cook a mean bell peppers and beef (hold the beef). Faye is the bad ass chick every show needs one of those for boobs and what not, she has a cool backstory. And then there's Ed.... wtf is that a boy or a girl? That bitch would have professor Oak give up raising Pokemon just to figure out the gender of this nigga. Oh yeah and there's Ein the dog, he barks and shit. 10/10\
\
Enjoyment:\
So, did I enjoy Cowboy Bebop? Does Kim Kardashian finger Kanyes butt hole? Is Xvideos better than porn hub? Did my father leave me at a young age because I was a failure as a son? I didn't just enjoy Cowboy Bebop, this was the first show i legit jerked off to, it took me on a ride ill never forget and it made me so erect my cock broke through space and time itself. I've never been on a trip like this ever since I took acid back in high school. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will most definitely maintain an erection for more than 5 hours. 10/10\

    Story\
Many times have I visited Cowboy Bebop, and every time we've parted company I leave with a sense of how great a conversationalist Cowboy Bebop truly is. How it tells beautiful stories with nothing but ink, paint, computers, and sound. How it seems to transcend it's own media and become something unto itself. Nothing to be worshiped or canonized, but to be viewed with a measure of respect, and perhaps awe, that such a thing ever took place at all.\
Cowboy Bebop, that's the story. There are cowboys and there is bebop, set against the backdrop of the future and space. The series concerns itself with\
          \
        the lives of Jet Black, Spike Spiegal, Faye Valentine, and Ed. The series itself tends to revolve around sorting out each characters past and reconciling it with their present selves. What sets Cowboy Bebop apart from similar series such as Outlaw Star is that these stories are actually interesting.\
\
Animation\
Animation directors strive for different goals. Some, like Hayou Miyazaki seek a balance between we humans and nature. The director of Ghost in the Shell, Mamoru Oshii forewarned us that advancement without restraint presented dillemas with no solutions. Shincihiro Wantanbe gave us, with Cowboy Bebop, twenty-six pictures of a world coming to terms with its past. The methods vary, with death, resignation, and an eyes wide shut attitude dominating. But never are these heady themes forced upon us with a heavy hand. They are at many times hidden behind sharp humor, attention to detail, and jaw dropping animation. Only two times are these themes truly brought to a head: at the twelfth and thirteenth episodes (parts one and two of Jupiter Jazz), and episodes twenty-five and twenty-six (parts one and two of The Real Folk Blues). And at these moments the music gets better, the animation sharper, and like true climactic moments, they stay with us long after we finish watching them.\
For it's time, Cowboy Bebop was about as good as television animation got. The style was classically anime, big eyes no nose, small mouth. The fighting animation is very fluid and detailed. But what most impressed me about Cowboy Bebop's animation was the variety of locals, and the lived in natures of every environment that is visited. From the Bebop itself, with its endless rooms and corridors to variety of ethnic architecture, it is truly a treat to behold. The computer graphics are dated by today's standard, but for its time was cutting edge.\
\
Sound\
Never before or since has such a catalog of music been assembled for an anime, any anime. The principle creator of Cowboy Bebop's music, Yoko Kanno, took the high-road. She hopped from genre to genre in leaps and bounds while never taking from the animation itself, but infusing it with a pulse that at all times seemed perfect. Sometimes characters are defined through music, like Gren, whose sax playing pronounces him melancholy, disillusioned, and cavalier. Three original soundtracks were put together for this anime, each one is distinct and non-repetitious. Listening to them on their own gives you new appreciation on the quality of Yoko Kannos gift.\
\
Characters\
Characters from Cowboy Bebop each have stories to tell. Each deals with its past and present as best they can, although often times not very well at all. The plot is linear as far as the time line is concerned, but there isn't a penultimate goal sought after. In terms of the classic definitions of conflict, Cowboy Bebop tends towards the man versus himself, or man versus man types of conflict. The principles of Cowboy Bebop do not seek paradigm shifts, do not seek to change the world for the better or worse, but simply to live to see another day. This struggle to live on is what makes Cowboy Bebop so enjoyable, and what gives a humanity to the principle characters that they would otherwise lack.\
\
Overall\
The concept of Cowboy Bebop is not original, but its execution is outstanding. The characters are not original, but how they interact with the world around them is. The music can be defined by genre, but the impact on the individual cannot. The animation has been topped over the years, the cgi definitely shows its age, but there are still moments of raw beauty that are still unparalleled. Cowboy Bebop is not a rite of passage in anime fandom, but it should be a signpost, showing you the difference between the sublime and the ordinary.\

    How can I possibly review \"Cowboy Bebop\"? The show has been reviewed, and re-reviewed, and talked about, and taken apart, been overrated, underrated, and just done to death that at this point my words would make about as much difference as if I were to drop a lit match onto the surface of the sun. But, maybe my words will read and maybe you the reader will be aided by them. \
The word I can use to describe this Anime best is cool. From the characters, to the artwork, to the soundtrack, to the dialogue. It's a smooth, fun, futuristic ride through this 26-episode series.\
          \
        Most episodes are stand alone with a few two part ones that deal with the big picture plot of the series. It has a massive tech-noir flavor, futuristic settings that are fogged by clouds of cigarette smoke and a jazz melody in the background. I hope the future is this cool. \
The characters in this show are unforgettable and grow on you very quickly. Spike Spiegel, the mellow martial arts bounty hunter with a mysterious past. Jet Black, the grizzled ex-cop with a cybernetic arm who enjoys gardening. Faye Valentine, the grifting femme fatale who always ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time. Ed, the little girl with a boys name who is a total genius and total goof, and Ein the Dog. He does dog stuff.  \
Now, don't go into this show expecting to be blown away. The amount of praise this show gets makes it sound like it will change your life, lower your taxes, and improve your gas mileage. It's a great show. A masterpiece. But step back, take a deep breath, and watch one episode at a time when you can. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. Don't binge. I find this is best way to enjoy the show. Sub vs. Dub is a surprising big win for the dub. Steve Blum, Wendee Lee, Beau Billingslea, and Melissa Fahn as Spike, Faye, Jet, and Ed play their parts to perfection and set the gold standard for every English dub before or since. If all English casts were as good as this, subtitles would not be necessary.\
I hope this review has helped you out and I thank you for taking the time to read it. Please enjoy \"Cowboy Bebop\" as much as I did. It's a great show. And a must-see for any Anime fan. 10/10. Check it out. Cheers! \

    I watched it because everyone said it is a masterpiece and must to watch but it ended up being disappointing. \
The overall anime is good and it had promise to be even better. In my point of view it had way too many pointless filler episodes and didn't really find good balance between being serious and laughable. I felt like the seriousness of the whole story was bit diminished by the fact that there were so many episodes just for laugh and giggles. \

    ***I originally posted this review on Anime-Planet***\
Critic's Log: Earthdate - March 12, 2012. Review #1: Cowboy Bebop.\
It is the year 2071 and Mars has become the central hub of human civilization ever since a hyperspace experiment on the moon failed and made Earth uninhabitable. The entire Solar System has been accessible thanks to reliable hyperspace gates and crime syndicates have exerted their power and influence over the government and the ISSP (Inter-Solar System-Police). As a result, The ISSP has put in a bounty system similar to The Old West has been included to deal with fugitives, terrorists and other criminals. The bounty hunters are usually\
          \
        called \"Cowboys\". Bounty hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet Black are flying around space and trying to catch their bounty.\
That is the premise of Cowboy Bebop. This is where I start to get technical, Cowboy Bebop does not have much of a main storyline (except for episodes like Ballad of Fallen Angels, the Two-part episode Jupiter Jazz and the two part finale The Real Folk Blues), and those 5 episodes are what you could call \"plot\" episodes, while the remaining 21 are standalone episodes. With that said, those episodes are not even considered filler. Some of the ideas in these standalone really stand out impressively. Here are some examples: Sympathy for the Devil, Waltz for Venus, Ganymede Elegy, etc., etc...\
If there is a blinding aspect, it is the animation. For 1998, the animation was pretty good back then and still looks good today. Some episodes have some cool animation effects as well. Sunrise is the animation studio behind Cowboy Bebop and that might not be saying much, however there is one apparent note about this show, apparently Cowboy Bebop's success led to 3 staff members from Sunrise that co-founded the studio that we know today as Studio Bones. In other words, animes like RahXephon, Wolf's Rain, Eureka Seven, Darker than BLACK, Soul Eater, and both Fullmetal Alchemist animes were apparently made possible due to Bebop's success. The action scenes are well animated, and the visuals are even breathtaking at times.\
If there are any anime purists out there that have not seen Cowboy Bebop yet, consider this recommendation an exception, the English dub is very good and hardly flawed. Steven Jay Blum gives Spike a good badass tone to his character, Wendee Lee sounds both sexy and sensitive as Faye, Beau Billingslea has a cool father-like tone as Jet, and Melissa Fahn is charmingly silly as Edward. The dub can be considered better than the original Japanese version of the show, and I have known some purists that mention that Cowboy Bebop's dub was very good. I personally love the dub, it was spot-on and all the voices matched. So, what do I think of the subtitled version? Answer: I find it Underrated compared to the dub. The voice cast of the subtitled version had some well-known voice actors such as Kouichi Yamadera, Megumi Hayashibara, Unsho Ishizuka, and even Norio Wakamoto is in the subbed version. There is nothing wrong with the subtitled version; it may be a bit overshadowed by the dubbed Version\
f there is an aspect that struck all the chords right is the soundtrack which is by Yoko Kanno. Some people consider Bebop's soundtrack to be her best. There is one fact about the soundtrack is that Kanno-san formed a band known as The Seatbelts which includes over 70 musicians which resided in Japan, New York, and Paris. I consider it impressive. If you try listening to the soundtrack without the show, it may feel like you're listening to an album rather than a soundtrack. The soundtrack really made a permanent impression on me. My personal favorite moment that involved the soundtrack was the two songs used in the cathedral scene, which were Rain and Green Bird. Hell, the opening theme kicks so much ass, and The Real Folk Blues is a good closing theme. The soundtrack is groovy\
What really makes the show impressive is that some scenes have music playing and not have much dialogue in it. This is somewhat of a symbolic example that silence can indeed be golden. This is Kanno-san’s most famous and critically acclaimed soundtrack. Otakus mostly rejoice when Kanno –san is involved in musical compositions ever since she finished her work on Cowboy Bebop. She is mostly a fan favorite in the anime fan base when it comes to the music department and that should come as no surprise. She’s that popular and talented. I do appreciate the work she has done up to this very day.\
The characters are also great. Spike is shown as a rogue badass with a past catching up to him. Jet appears to be a cool guy who happens to be the Captain of the Bebop. Faye is a con-woman and an interesting character even though she is kind of rude. Ein is adorable, and Edward is a silly random character that has a positive outlook in life. I think she was an awesome character for comic relief in the show. Some minor characters were also interesting. There is a common theme that runs through all of the characters and that is the pasts of these characters. It's definitely an overused trope but I think the past is something we all quite can't forget which doesn't make this trope clichéd, it's just a common one that is almost always effective.\
\
Cowboy Bebop claims to be a genre unto itself. I am not sure how to give a clear analogy on that, but it has interesting themes that are unique to the show. There are some homages and send ups to famous movies in this show. This is a show that knew how to treat adults and people who like movies, music, Science Fiction, Western and so forth. Shinichiro Watanabe really nailed the direction of this anime because he always liked to mix up different opposing styles to make something completely new and unordinary. Cowboy Bebop has elements of Western, Space Opera, Film Noir, Martial Arts, and Jazz music. All these elements blended extremely well and this was a very unique anime at the time and I can understand why this anime was so revolutionary at the time. End Result: WINNING!\
\
Since the popularity of Cowboy Bebop soared past through the stars, is it even fair to say that this show is overrated? It is considered an influential anime and I see why, a lot of people have universally praised the hell out of this show. The stories, animation, characters, music, and style are blended in so well that it almost makes it hard to see animes of this caliber.\
If there is a drawback, I could say that this show could have gone a bit longer, and on a personal note, Boogie Woogie Feng Shui was the only episode I did not like too much. If you like it, that's fine.\
If you stick to the series long enough, I guarantee you'll like the ending. There are a lot of people that see the ending as one of the most fitting endings to an anime and it really ends with a bang. I'm dead serious, if you haven't seen this series then do yourself a favor and watch the damn show, it will not disappoint you unless you are extremely picky.\
Cowboy Bebop is available by Bandai Entertainment, and even though Bandai Entertainment no longer licenses anime, they mentioned that they will keep their current catalog, so apparently there's nothing to worry about this anime being out of print in the US (I hope). The manga adaptation Cowboy Bebop: Shooting Star written by Hajime Yatate and illustrated by Cain Kuga and another manga adaptation of Cowboy Bebop also written by Hajime Yatate and illustrated by Yutaka Nanten were available by Tokyopop and It is possible that those two manga adaptations are out of print. Cowboy Bebop the Movie is available by Sony Pictures and I will review it next.\
With that said, Cowboy Bebop is a smash hit jam-session that has become a genre unto itself; it has thrills, action, humor, and most of all fun. It is a hard one not to like. However, Not only anime fans like this show, some people that don't watch anime much or even anime-haters admit this show is exceptional and they even liked the show. This show has an American influence and it appeals to viewers that like anime, sci-fi, action flicks, and westerns. At the time I am posting this, this anime is still airing on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block since 2001. The constant re-runs and the fan base have turned this anime to a cult classic (metaphorically speaking, it has a devoted fan base... nothing to do with religious cults or something like that; it's a play on words). It may not be everyone's cup of tea but it is definitely worth trying. It's an anime I sometimes quote as well as some others. Some will say that this is the greatest anime ever made, but that may be stretching it too much, but I will agree in calling it a revolutionary anime and a fun anime at that.  it is truly a gem.\
I give Cowboy Bebop a 10 out of 10 (It is a MASTERPIECE!)\

    I'm going to be quite honest here, most episodic anime, such as Cowboy Bebop really doesn't do a whole lot for me. But it's strange, in all it's 26 episode glory, Cowboy Bebop has managed to do what no other anime has ever done and that is too ensnare me in it's word right from the beginning never failing in letting me go. Cowboy Bebop is, quite simply, my favorite Anime ever. No other anime has shown me such a perfectly balanced world, with such an awe-inspiring atmosphere dripping with originality like Cowboy Bebop has. \
For starters, it's entirely character driven. The show lives and\
          \
        dies by how it manages to get you to connect with its characters. Cowboy Bebop is one of those rare shows that you don't really need to have a favorite character (although we all do, mine is Spike like most people) because you love all the characters so much you being to sympathize and feel connected with every one of them. It's story is also mixed with a perfect marriage between drama and humor. I've seen people call Cowboy Bebop one of the most depressing anime they've ever seen and I've seen other people call Cowboy Bebop the funniest anime they've seen. The reason it can be so funny without intruding on the seriousness of the plot, is due to the fact that unlike most humor in anime, the humor in Cowboy Bebop is deftly subtle. There are really no instances where the show seems immature or chained to conventional anime humor cliches' and I really can't help but appreciate it all the more. You'll laugh, you'll smile, I wanna say you'll cry, but I didn't, your heart strings will definitely be tugged at a time or seven. The thing the series is most notable for, however, is definitely the music. It's more or less a blend of jazz, blues and contemporary rock that almost blends too naturally with the Space Cowboy setting. Each episode has a different musical theme and the Bebop series really gave me the majority of my favorite anime music. \
Listen, I can sit here and talk about how great Cowboy Bebop is all day, but the more I do that, the less time you'll have to sit down and watch it yourself. This is simply one of those anime series that you NEED to watch to call yourself a proper anime fan. I'm not saying you'll love it as much as I do, but if you don't at least give Cowboy Bebop a chance, you're a fool. \

    Story 6/10\
I mean it is not a bad story but is it really that \"great\"? A bunch of bounty hunters and a kid link up to go on adventures together while exploring a rather bland world set in space. The stories (episodes) could have been more exciting, with more plot twists, big reveals and emotionally driven. Frankly it was too straight forward for me to consider it anything amazing.\
Art 8/10\
For a 90s anime it has aged very well. The spaceships are very unique and the environment represent space travel dystopian suited to its time.\
Sound 9/10\
At first I was like \"this OP is garbage and ED\
          \
        is okay\". Then as it went on, I discovered the soundtrack within the episodes to be the best part of the series for me personally. The songs are varied, the instrumentals are atmospheric and certain tracks fitted with the scenarios perfectly. Although I warn you, I only started to appreciate it later in the series.\
Character 6/10\
I think I would have touched a nerve with scoring the characters this low but  they are mediocre. They are not particularly interesting when you compare them to something like One Piece where every character whether side or main are filled with so much personality. Spike is cool, Ed fluffy, Faye feisty and Jet a boring old man but these are pretty one dimensional (with interesting backstories I guess). But nothing about them gripped me, maybe they were too \"ordinary\".\
Enjoyment 7/10\
Now I'll go into detail of what I enjoyed and didn't.\
As mentioned briefly, the adventures are not that exciting besides Spike episodes. Luckily he got the most screen time. \
Then we hit episode 12 and everything became a little more interesting with Faye's back story just starting then my interest tailed off again. By episode 20 I was a bit discouraged to finish it. Due to its episodic nature you are literally judging episode by episode. One minute it's interesting next minute it's average. It depended on the character in focus a lot of the time. Spike and Faye would captivate me briefly then Jet and Ed would bore me (bar the mushroom episode with Ed was fun).\
Although, it ended very strongly - Episode 24 left me with a weird feeling. Seeing that certain characters were potentially leaving made me feel sad. I can't remember when my attachment to them creeped up on me but it just did. The sound track had placed it's role perfectly.\
So the last few episodes were great. Suddenly everyone opened up about their true feelings and suddenly the characters came to life. But it was too little too late, it was not worth all 26 episodes. I would have rather just watched Spike/Faye related episodes or a movie that summarised it all.\
The Anime does very little wrong. It doesn't engage in fan service or annoying anime tropes. Everything feels authentic and true to itself. If you enjoy the characters interactions you will enjoy the episodic nature and that's the problem. It's episodic so there's no bigger story or world building to keep your imagination turning. There's nothing to get your heart racing, no complex theories to chew over, no back stories to pull your heart strings (wait Faye's nearly had me but they didn't go deep enough!). \
It's just every day life in space, well written with just the right amount of action. But I personally don't watch anime for this laid back sort of shows.Thus the wow factor didn't rub off on me. It didn't excite me enough. If I wasn't marathoning it, I doubt I won't anticipate an episode. I'll simply tune in if I had a spare moment.\

    I will get heat for saying this is how I truly feel. Cowboy Bebop is good but overrated for me. First of all, the characters, artwork, music, sound effects were absolutely incredible and way ahead of it's time. SHOUT OUT TO THE THEME SONG!!!! But the story just didn't do it for me. The main villain I felt was not developed enough to make me care about him and it's because of this, the conflict between the protagonist and antagonist just didn't resonate. I will say the final episode was very well done and entertaining but in the end, I couldn't help but feel unsatisfied\
          \
        by the whole show. I can't say in my right mind that I'd recommend it to everyone. For people who love episodic shows, this is as close to heaven as you can get. But for some that don't love that sort of format, I'd recommend to at least give it a shot as there is some high quality material to be found here. In the end, it was still an enjoyable experience and that's why I give it a 7.\

    *In this review I will be switching to a different reviewing system/format.\
Cowboy Bebop is often considered one of the greatest anime of all time. I’ve considered watching it for a long time, but I never really got around to it until recently. And now that I’ve finally watched it, I regret not watching the show sooner, not only because it was a good series, but also because I think that if it had been one of the first anime that I watched I would’ve liked it a lot more.\
Story:\
The story takes place all over the universe in the year 2071. Cowboy Bebop’s story revolves around\
          \
        four main characters, Spike Spiegel, Jet Black, Faye Valentine, and Edward. They are all bounty hunters aboard Jet’s ship the Bebop. My main issue with the series as a whole is how the story is told. It’s told in a way that makes every episode seem like a small stand-alone story. The series was too episodic, and there were very few episodes that actually felt connected to each other. That being said, my favorite episodes were the ones that focused on the backgrounds of the characters, even though an overall plot really didn’t connect all of them. I just wished that Cowboy Bebop had a more focused narrative.\
Animation:\
I’d heard nothing but good things about the animation in Cowboy Bebop; but, since it came out in 1998, I wasn’t sure how much I would like it. I’m glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the animation. There were times where I thought, “Wow, this was made in 1998?” But there were other times where I thought, “Yeah, this was made in 1998.” Overall, the animation is solid throughout the entire series.\
Sound:\
The sound in Cowboy Bebop is one of the best parts of this series. The whole sound track has a soulful and jazzy vibe. The only issue I have with the sound is that the only songs that you hear multiple times are the songs of the opening and ending. This isn’t really a bad thing. The opening and ending are both really good, but there are just so many good songs you hear throughout the series that I wish that they would’ve used more often. Most of the songs are episode specific, so the music definitely fits the overall themes and tones of the episode, but you’ll probably never hear those songs again throughout the entire series.\
Characters:\
The characters are the most interesting part of this series. They all and have totally different personalities, and reasons for becoming bounty hunters. All of them have a mysterious past, which they are either not willing to talk about or just don’t remember. As I said earlier, my favorite episodes in the series are the ones that focus on the backgrounds of the characters. This is partially because these episodes feel the most connected in terms of an overarching narrative, and also partially because I found those episodes the most entertaining. Spike’s background episodes in particular had the some of, if not, the best action scenes in the entire series. There are also several supporting and side characters in the series, but you usually won’t see them in more than one episode. This is fine because during that one episode that they are in their entire story or reason for being there is explained pretty well.\
Enjoyment:\
Like I said earlier, I think that if this had been one of the first anime that I’d ever watched I would’ve liked this series a lot more than I do. Don’t get me wrong, Cowboy Bebop is an entertaining series, but it has a very episodic format that took away some of the enjoyment for me.\
Verdict & Breakdown:\
Story: 3.4/5\
Animation: 3.5/5\
Sound: 4/5\
Characters: 4/5\
Enjoyment: 3.5/5\
Verdict: 3.7/5\
Even though I don’t think this series is a masterpiece, Cowboy Bebop is a classic anime that is definitely worth checking out.\

    Cowboy Bebop is a popular high rated anime though many people finds it bad and it is  dropped a lot. Am I surprised of either one of both? Actually not. I am one of the few who is in between of them. So I can understand the arguments of both sides. This is a difficult serie for me to rate. Since the things they have done good are extremely good however for the bad things counts the same. Trying to guide you aswell as me trough my thoughts. Isn’t the most obvious thing to do. But I will give it a try.\
So lets begin\
          \
        with the story: It is basically about bounty hunters from the year 2072. These bounty hunters are referred as cowboys a lot in the serie and bebop is the name of their spaceship, if I am not mistaken. So that is where the title comes from. I don’t think there is anything else important to know for now.\
\
The first thing I would like to tell you about the serie is that it is very episodic (If that is even a word). I meant that every episode tells its own story and all those stories gives an idea of their life. I personally don’t like that fact because then you cannot be sucked in the serie as it is supposed to be. That is another reason why I had difficulties to get into the serie and I think that is probably one of the reasons why so many people dropped this anime. On top of that some episodes felt bad and a lot felt like they are fillers. However the good episodes where very good and very amusing to watch. Thats why it is very difficult to criticize the story. Simply because it exist out of 24 different stories. I just don’t like to put a number on the whole bunch and if I would do it on the whole serie it won’t be good either, since it doesn’t has a real plot or something because of this. But I can tell that my rating of these stories goes from 3 to 9 with the higher numbers in the end. Probably cause I started to appreciate the style more. Though the end isn’t built up as good as the other anime series, it is really good and suits the anime perfectly.\
I am not really a sci-fi fan, especially things like star wars. This was completely different though. They didn’t put any attention to the future gadgets. I think they did it just for some more spectacular action scenes with those ships. It gave me actually more the feeling that it happened in the past then in the future. especially with those old (beautiful) drawings and the jazz, blues, classic background music. This is all positive in my opinion though. I really like the serie way better as it is.\
Guess it is time to go more positive now the worse part of it is done. The best part of the serie for me was without doubt the music. The way they make blues, jazz and classic music exiting is unbelievable! Or is it that what makes the serie exciting? To be honest I don’t know, the only thing I know is that it perfectly suits each other. The way they made the combination let even me enjoy classic music. They really overmastered James Bond with it. Cowboy Bebop just puted Jazz music in the action scenes While James Bond need those good action scenes to get popular. The way they add those weird random sounds at it is really risky. But it is done so great that I love it. The fact that it is so original makes it good. I can understand that a lot of people (especially the younger ones) cannot appreciate that music and surely not in this way. But for me it just made the serie.\
The characters are pretty good to. Especially Jet and Spike (the main characters) in my opinion. the other ones aren’t bad but they didn’t got me that much. Probably because The episodes where a new character joins are boring in my opinion. But I must admit that they are all very original. The episodes that goes about Jet and Spike and the way they develop them (slowly but good and full of charm) are very good. That is one of the reasons I absolutely fell in love with those characters. \
However the drawings are old and not that good at first sight, I really started to like them. Spike his look, his hair, his poses, his fights, his cigarettes, … It is all just drawn so beautiful. It may look old but it is still full of charm and emotion. Not only Spike is well drawn but he is just the climax of the drawings in this serie.\
So that is why I have double feelings for this wonderful seinen serie.\

    Cowboy Bebop is different from other anime in that it does not focus on a linear storyline to progress through the series. It is like a series of short stories that all use the same characters in different scenarios to see how they react when presented with a challenge. However, not all the sessions are disconnected. As we get further into the series, we delve into the past of each character, which gives us a better understanding of how and why each of them act the way they do. This show is more character driven than anything, and because of the memorable characters it provides,\
          \
        Cowboy Bebop is a masterpiece. \
Story/ Pacing - 9/10\
I rate the story a 9 although, as I said before, there is not really a linear storyline. Bebop is not your typical anime in that it is episodic. Each \"session\" presents the characters with a different problem, whether it be chasing another bounty or solving a personal issue. These are usually resolved within the same session, save for the pair of two-parters and the many questions about the characters and their backstory. In fact, most of the sessions do not seem to be connected because of the difference in plot. However you soon find this to be untrue as more and more is uncovered about the history of each character. The story does not deserve a perfect score because the show's focus is not on the story, but instead atmosphere and the characters.\
Art - 9/10 \
Cowboy Bebop is often seen as a classic anime not only because of the reception it received, but its age. Going on 16 years since its release, it has that retro art feel that can be compared to a Miyazaki film. Every scene is filled with incredible detail, and the characters are no exception. Everything in this anime looks beautiful. There is no laziness in the animation itself, which makes everything flow and look natural. \
Sound/Music - 9/10 \
This is a difficult portion to judge. The voices many times are quite grainy and echoey, but it is important to remember that this is an older anime and the sound standards have been improved since its debut. In my opinion it doesn't take away from the show or experience whatsoever, but that is up to the viewer to decide. The music is really what makes the sound category worthy of praise. The introduction song, Tank!, gets you excited for the upcoming events with its fast pace beat and memorable \"3, 2, 1, Let's jam\" to get things rolling. The music is placed perfectly alongside events so to help convey the emotions of the characters.\
Characters - 10/10\
The characters are really what make this anime special. All of them bring a unique personality to the table, making the crew well rounded. These differing personalities do clash, but nonetheless, it is obvious how close the crew gets. All of them have mysterious pasts that are uncovered as you progress through the series. Every question that comes up should be answered by the end (depending on how you view the series conclusion). As I've stated before, the show's primary focus is on the history of each character and their individual desires regarding resolving personal crises. They are truly a memorable cast and are the main reason this show is a classic. \
Enjoyment - 10/10\
This section is much less objective than the others because someone can tell you all the contributing factors that make a show good or bad but it is up to the viewer to decide whether or not they actually enjoy it. I found it incredibly easy to enjoy because the pacing is never slow and something interesting is always happening. This is thanks to the episodic nature of the series, which allows almost every session to tell another story. \
Overall - 9/10 \
This show is a masterpiece. It's aesthetic value alone makes it a work of art. The Wild West influences and incredible amount of musical references make it appealing to a wide demographic. The use of sessions rather than linked episodes catalyzes a pace and storyline that both make the series very entertaining. The characters are all unique and very easy to get attached to. All these elements came together to create the perfect storm that is Cowboy Bebop. If you have not seen it already, I highly recommend that you take the time to do so. \

FOREWORD:\
For those of you who have grown up watching good anime your whole life, let me tell you a little secret: there was a time not all that long ago when translated, licensed episodes didn't exist in the U.S. This wasn't just because most people didn't know about it; in reality, the majority of Americans simply weren't interested. Cowboy Bebop changed all that. \
SUMMARY:\
Of all the shows I've ever seen, this one takes the cake. Just because it's old doesn't mean you shouldn't watch\
          \
        it- in fact, it's pretty difficult nowadays to find anything of a similar caliber amidst the never ending wave of eye-candy garbage that big name companies have begun to produce. \
Cowboy Bebop will lead you on an incredible adventure- one that is certainly full of tasteful humor and suspense, but also possesses an unexpected level of depth and meaning. It will draw you in gently with its art and sound, captivate you with its character development, and move your soul with its plot. \
The lighting, angles, and details in the art are unmatched. The music, too, is tasteful and unique, and compliments the atmosphere of each scene exquisitely. Every character is developed meaningfully throughout the show, and their distinct personalities are coordinated in a way that is both refreshing and endearing. \
This show will take your breath away. It will open up new vistas of thought, and leave you with a heart that better understands- if only a little- what it truly means to be human.\

    As a fairly new anime fan I obviously started with some of the most recommnded shows, and Cowboy Bebop was one of the first. This show is considered a masterpiece thanks to the alleged fascinating characters, outstanding story and amazing music. \
Let's start with the latter- the Jazz soundtrack is really cool, though not notable or memorable in most of the parts. The openening theme is super cool, and I almost never skipped it (a thing I usually do). \
The show has a nice background story- after an accident in the hyperspace the Earth became uninhabitable, and humanity colonized the other planets and moons of\
          \
        the solar system. Meanwhile, crime rates have risen, and bounty hunters help the police catch criminals. In short- a fair setting for a space western. There are indeed some beautiful views and space battle scenes in here. \
The problems begin when the story starts being told. First, like most in of the shows in which the episodes' plots aren't tightly connected, troubles tend to get fixed to quickly. A more major problem is that the first 10 episodes are absolutely boring! If the show wasn't considered a must-watch classic that luckily has only one season, I probably wouldn't have gone past them. The 11th episode is a turning point in the manner of the plot quality, altough such episode was probably made in every show with a spaceship ever. \
But eventually, the biggest cause for my personal relative unenjoyment was the thing that the show is most praised for- the characters. It is true that all the main characters have mysterious troubled pasts that are explored throughout the show. However, because we know nothing of them at the beginning of the show, and their backstories are revealed way to slowly, I couldn't find even a small piece of interest in any of the characters until the very last episodes. For example, Jet's past which was the first to be revealed, is actually quite an uninteresting unoriginal cliche. Around episode 20 I realized that my favorite character is actually Ein the dog! Combining that with the boring first 10 episodes, I got a show that I would likely drop in an early stae unless I was feeling obligated to watch it until the end as a so called classic. \
Also, I was really bothered by the unproportional bodies of Spike and Faye, or more specifically- their extermely long legs.   \

    The almighty and legendary Cowboy Bebop. Well, here goes my best shot. \
Story: 7,5\
At first to me it seemed like Cowboy Bebop will be an episodic anime, which ones are usually plain bad and become boring after a few episodes. But Cowboy Bebop is a proof that anime mustn't evolve a single plot straight only to conclusion. Truth be said most of the Cowboy Bebop episodes are fillers, but not to the bad meaning of the fillers that you usually see in Naruto or Bleach or any other anime.\
In Cowboy Bebop these episodes are more like expansions off the characters and mini stories with\
          \
        their own thoughts and meaning. Almost all of the episodes have some points to make and are relevant to the characters. They allow you to get more attached to characters. Sometimes you get small flashbacks in some episodes and they improve your understanding of how human and realistic these characters are.\
As for the plot relevant episodes I would really have wanted more of them, because they seemed to answer a lot of questions, but not enough to satisfy my curiosity. I really would want to know more about Spikes past. And the ending even though very cool and memorable for me seemed a bit dissapointing. Also if you think about it the main story is kinda cliche if not for the ending.\
Visuals: 9,25\
The visuals are more then you should ask for. Cowboy Bebop was made in 1998 and truth be it has put to shame other anime since 1998 to even now as for the visuals. The best I liked about it was how detailed it was, all the characters are easy to distinguish and backgrounds are very beautiful too. Backgrounds change a lot of times as the Bebop crew goes from different planets starting to mostly deserted planets to snowy cold planets. \
As for the animation it is very smooth and fluid, the action is very well choreographed and only once I saw repeated movement and I think it was done on purpose to make Ed look silly, not because the animators were lazy.\
Sound: 10\
Everything about sound is just WOW and awesome to the extreme. The opening is great and I didn't skip it once for all 26 episodes.\
As for the background music there is a lot of it and even though it mostly consists of jazz, bebop and bluze it also had one episode with heavy metal and some other music too. The background music usually surprised me of how good it was all out through the series. That background music just made every major moment in this anime just so much more memorable and enjoyable.That's what you get from Yoko Kanno.\
I personally only have seen the dub, but from what I heard it is one of the best, if not the best dubs out there . I think that Steve Blumes role as Spike Spiegel is his best.\
Characters: 8 \
It's not like you really get a lot of time spent on building up the characters, but somehow on the way you pick up pieces about Spike, Faye, Jet and Ed. As the series progresses you get some parts of there back-stories, but you don't get all of it. Well at least I thought that there could of been more back-stories for them. But I have to admit that it helped for extra realism that you don't know all about these characters from the start even to the end there are a lot mystery around them.\
As for other characters they show up and disappear very soon except Vicous the villain ( his name sounds like a villain already)  who I didn't like, because a real villain needs to have a fucking good reason to be a villain, but all I got from him is that he has bad past with Spike, which really doesn't explain a lot, because we don't know much about Spikes past except for few flashbacks.\
Enjoyment: 9\
I enjoyed this anime a lot. Never did I get bored watching it and most of the time I was stuck to screen sitting on the edge of my seat. But I have to say that once the episode was done I wasn't that reluctant to go watch the next episode, because there wasn't an overarching plot that would connect from one episode to the next.\
Overall: 9\
The best part about Cowboy Bebop was the music and animation. The production value for this anime was very high even for nowadays standards. I have to say that I didn't like the story that much because I found it cliche a bit and the characters even though cool and pretty much realistic they didn't really relate to me. But also I must admit that this anime has something that you really can't categorize and that is style. And that style just makes all those bad things I said about it almost meaningless.\
I would recommend this anime to every anime fan and even to people that haven't seen any anime, because it has a lot of good qualities that could interest non-anime people into watching it. As for those people who care more about the stories morals and what it has to tell you about everything I would not advise you to jump in watching this anime with high expectations, because Cowboy Bebop is more about style over matter.\

    Cowboy Bebop is a whole collection of classic genres, all mixed into one series and all done right, to the point that it breathes new life into a very stale genre. If ever there was a series more deserving to be a sleeper hit, Bebop is it.\
Many times have I visited Cowboy Bebop, and every time we've parted company I leave with a sense of how great a conversationalist Cowboy Bebop truly is. How it tells beautiful stories with nothing but ink, paint, computers, and sound. How it seems to transcend it's own media and become something unto itself. Nothing to be worshiped or canonized,\
          \
        but to be viewed with a measure of respect, and perhaps awe, that such a thing ever took place at all.\
Cowboy Bebop, that's the story. There are cowboys and there is bebop, set against the backdrop of the future and space. The series concerns itself with the lives of Jet Black, Spike Spiegal, Faye Valentine, and Ed. The series itself tends to revolve around sorting out each characters past and reconciling it with their present selves. What sets Cowboy Bebop apart from similar series such as Outlaw Star is that these stories are actually interesting.\
The places they visit are far from what one would expect. Instead of Neo-Tokyo with its shiny, impossibly tall skyscrapers that never end, we have Neo-Tijuana, with its dusty dirt roads, run down shacks and migrant workers. Space is ethnic, but not in the Star Trek sanitized for the sake of politically correctness way. Each colony reflects a melting pot more akin to Los Angeles or New York City than any Blade Runner wannabe ever could.\
Characters from Cowboy Bebop each have stories to tell. Each deals with its past and present as best they can, although often times not very well at all. The plot is linear as far as the time line is concerned, but there isn't a penultimate goal sought after. In terms of the classic definitions of conflict, Cowboy Bebop tends towards the man versus himself, or man versus man types of conflict. The principles of Cowboy Bebop do not seek paradigm shifts, do not seek to change the world for the better or worse, but simply to live to see another day. This struggle to live on is what makes Cowboy Bebop so enjoyable, and what gives a humanity to the principle characters that they would otherwise lack.\
Animation directors strive for different goals. Some, like Hayou Miyazaki seek a balance between we humans and nature. The director of Ghost in the Shell, Mamoru Oshii forewarned us that advancement without restraint presented dillemas with no solutions. Shincihiro Wantanbe gave us, with Cowboy Bebop, twenty-six pictures of a world coming to terms with its past. The methods vary, with death, resignation, and an eyes wide shut attitude dominating. \
But never are these heady themes forced upon us with a heavy hand. They are at many times hidden behind sharp humor, attention to detail, and jaw dropping animation. Only two times are these themes truly brought to a head: at the twelfth and thirteenth episodes (parts one and two of Jupiter Jazz), and episodes twenty-five and twenty-six (parts one and two of The Real Folk Blues). And at these moments the music gets better, the animation sharper, and like true climactic moments, they stay with us long after we finish watching them. Everything in Cowboy Bebop seems to breathe with life and motion, even in otherwise stoic scenes, and it's a rarity and a marvel to behold.\
Never before or since has such a catalog of music been assembled for an anime, any anime. The principle creator of Cowboy Bebop's music, Yoko Kanno, took the high-road. She hopped from genre to genre in leaps and bounds while never taking from the animation itself, but infusing it with a pulse that at all times seemed perfect. Sometimes characters are defined through music, like Gren, whose sax playing pronounces him melancholy, disillusioned, and cavalier. Three original soundtracks were put together for this anime, each one is distinct and non-repetitious. Listening to them on their own gives you new appreciation on the quality of Yoko Kannos gift.\
The concept of Cowboy Bebop is not original, but its execution is outstanding. The characters are not original, but how they interact with the world around them is. The music can be defined by genre, but the impact on the individual cannot. The animation has been topped over the years, the cgi definitely shows its age, but there are still moments of raw beauty that are still unparalleled. Cowboy Bebop is not a rite of passage in anime fandom, but it should be a signpost, showing you the difference between the sublime and the ordinary.\

    Cowboy Bebop is one of those things that has not aged well. Not because it wasn't a high quality, groundbreaking show that helped to define the genre, but BECAUSE it helped to defined the genre. I'll say now: I didn't grow up with this show. By the time I got around to watching it, I was about 20 and have seen these formulas and characters over and over again. Did Cowboy Bebop do it first? Probably not. Did they do it well? The popularity suggests they did it very very well.\
However, over the years people have used this formula so many times that it has\
          \
        fallen into a cliche. To someone watching it (without nostalgia value) everything is predictable and gets painfully boring painfully fast. There wasn't anything shocking in it, nothing I couldn't see happening 5 episodes beforehand, and every character was one I had seen a million times before and wasn't interested in seeing again.\
If you're asking me for specifics on what I didn't like, I can't even give that many. It was, for me, a totally forgettable experience.  While I would never deny someone their nostalgia, I'd warn newer viewers to check out something a little more fresh.\

    In my mind, Cowboy Bebop is the perfect show for people you know who say \"Anime? What are you, 12?\" \
It's slick, it's funny, it's serious, and it knows how to avoid anime stereotypes. It has characters that you'll never get tired of, plot twists that will keep you watching up late at night, epic fight scenes, and a soundtrack that is worth shelling out for.\
With that said, let's roll.\
Story: 9\
Though it wanders on occasion, I'd like to say that nearly 100% of the time it's to develop characters further or to add a bit of humor. The Star Trek parody episode was a bit\
          \
        over the top (but enjoyable), and to me it's hard to enjoy enjoy the filler episodes as much as the ones where sh*t really gets real. But let's delve into those. WOW. The last two episodes of the show are as good as it gets in anime. Not to mention the 5th episode, or the back-to-back ones that take place on Mars. I won't ruin any story elements, but look forward to these. If you take anything from this review, take this: those 5 episodes are worth watching over, and over, and over, for any anime fan.\
Art: 8\
It's tough to write a review now for a show that took place as long ago as it did, but I'll give it a shot. It's well drawn, and well animated, but it's nothing mindblowing. I remember seeing the first episode fight scenes and being thoroughly impressed, but for me the main draws of the show were always the music, the characters, and the story. I can't say I've ever been much of an art critic, but for the most part is was aesthetically pleasing. I was certainly impressed by the character design, and the world that the artists created was both interesting and desirable. \
Sound: 10\
Yoko Kanno honestly outdid herself this time. In all my years of watching anime, this is the first time I've really felt like I NEEDED the soundtrack. Great OP, great songs throughout, great everything. So impressed with what she did here.\
Character: 9 \
How can you not love Spike Spiegel or Faye Valentine? They're the ones that you'd like to be in real life. To me, it's not just how badass the characters are, it's the ideals they represent. Honor, bravery, and an unwillingness to let anything stand before something that you know in your heart is right. The only comparison that I can make here is a show called Firefly, which isn't an anime but in some ways reminds me of Bebop. Great design, great execution, and I wouldn't get sick of any of them even if the show went on for 100 eps. \

    ~No Spoiler~\
The storyline is great.\
If you want to know if you're going to like Cowboy Bebop, I suggest to watch the first 4 episodes, they are a small introducing to the rest to the series. \
The story is about a space cowboy named spike, he is a bounty hunter on the ship the bebop. Together with Faye and Jet he collects bounty's, this isn't going that well all the time, therefore Cowboy bebop has a lot of humor, unlike most anime. \
The episodes selves are all different stories in one storyline, that's what makes Cowboy bebop unique. Every episode has got a lot of action\
          \
        in it, so it'll never bore you! It's really different from the other anime, but it's still good. \
All characters in the Bebop has his own backstory, which all get's unraveled during the series. \
I really enjoyed watching this serie and I highly suggest you to watch it. \
It has everything, again! Action, a bit romance, depression, humor and even horror (it's my opionon of horror ;))\
So if you want a good anime, I suggest this one.\

    Cowboy bebop is probably the most influential piece in the history of anime.\
I guess i'm the one being played now. \
This is elegant, stupidly elegant! It just REEKS masterpiece. OH MAN. And the soundtrack, oh the soundtrack. It is just such a shame 'The Seatbelts' split up after only a few bebop related projects. Japanese jazz is mastered here, it only took 40 years after the genre peaked in some anime. Weird that. \
Eccentric Charles Mingus-esque bop and post bop is beautifully paired with extravagantly smooth folk and blues remnants. 'Jupiter jazz' and 'Space lion' will forever be this anime's masterpieces. \
Cowboy bebop, especially, can\
          \
        boast a tasteful blend of western and eastern styles of film, it never really takes itself too seriously. Do I need to speak about the writing? These characters are too charismatic for their own good, in life and death they exemplified perfection, Spike especially. Consistency would have awarded this piece a 10.\
You're Gonna Carry That Weight. \
The weight that is at once the load of our past and also the promise and burden of unrealized hopes and aspirations for the future - the future Spike never had a chance with. As Shinichiro Watanabe once revealed about this line taken from the last Beatles's album, \"The meaning behind that phrase, since the Beatles took a lot of weight from the fans, was that the fans had to now carry that weight.\"\
This short series of 26 sessions has been nothing short of an immaculately conceived dream. The Bebop takes us on a joyride but sends us back with an encouraging lesson: while Spike is no longer able to carry the weight, we, whose lives and dreams continue, can. - [ Leigh ]\
No piece can boast of such a mastery of sound and characterization in the history of anime. I definitely felt that weight.\

    I,ve been hearing a lot about how Cowboy Bebop is so unoriginal and that there are way more better anime out there but they are wrong, there is nothing else to it they are just plain wrong and here's why.\
Story 9/10 this part I can understand a little bit because the show has an episodic manner and then it get's into a story at the end and some people say that the rest of the show was a waste but if the show was about the characters trying to get to the end the show would have been much worse everyone says that all the\
          \
        episodes are the same but when I rewatched it I realised that none of the episodes were the same,there was this one user who said that all the episodes were like an example that he gave and he perfectely described 1 episode, none of the other episodes were like that.\
10/10 The art is also one of the most outstanding things about the show, all of it was so smooth and interesting and everything was slightly shaded to compliment the tone of the show.\
Sound 10/10 The sound and the music are beyond perfect for the show because the hole show is in the future but the nice jazzy guitars and harmonicas make the show set like a western and they go perfect with the show. Not to mention the opening is kick ass.\
Characters 10/10 A lot of people say that the characters are cliche and boring but they,re all good, Everyone says that Spike is your average cool guy but why is that bad? You litterally just insulted someone by saying that they,re cool and Spike is more than just cool he is skilled at martiwl arts and he has many funny and cool one liners to make his character loveable. Jet is good but people say that he doesn't have character devellopment but Cowboy Bebop is not about character devellopment, it,s about peopke who have been through character devellopment and they are just living out their lives.\
Enjoyment 10/10 The show has many interesting stories anda ridiculous amount of amazing scenes the action is cool the one liners are epice and/or funny and the show never lets you down on any episode.\
Overall 10/10 Cowboy Bebop is the best anime of all time and if you don't think so then you have shit taste.",

    This anime is an icon and an inspiration.\
The anime is revealed in episodes, with each episode having its own story with occasional flash backs (for character development) in between. It is simple and easy to understand. Each episode is so perfect that it is able to provide some brief history about the events that occurred as well as cover the current happenings. The episodes also have nice combination of some light heartened and emotional moods. The endings are quite satisfying (in general manner).\
The art is bit dull but it fits in showcasing the anime as western style anime. Characters are well defined with each having\
          \
        its own unique features which match their personality. The background details like vehicles, planets and space stations across the anime do not diminish in quality.\
The animation is very fluid given it is a decade old and no digital tech was not used.\
Voice acting is wonderfully performed as it properly matched with the personality of characters and the emotions they show. The music in the anime involves jazz, blues, classic rock which gives awesome emotional detail to given situations. The opening theme “TANK” is one of the main features of the anime. It gives an idea of what expect in the anime. And just listening it creates eagerness for the show.\
Each character in this anime is at height of cool in their respective areas (personality wise) thus making them memorable. Spike is a bounty hunter, martial arts specialist and awesome pilot. Jet, earlier a cop and now head of the bebop crew, he is somewhat like guiding figure for others. Faye is an independent, stylish woman with a bad habit of gambling. Edward is a genius child from earth whose presence create situation light hearten. Their way of working out the circumstances together given their diverse backgrounds is most interesting to watch. Characters also have to face their past which shows how they react to situations which are sensitive to them. And they do it quite well.\
Cowboy bebop is truly amazing amine with all the right mix of characters, story, and animation thus being among the best anime of all time. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime.\

    Story: 8/10\
A Series that was made in the late 90s and looking at that time where the anime was made, it had a quite interesting and nice story. The anime haves the old style of airing episodes, where almost every episode is for itself, just like in marvel shows.\
Every single episode was really great in its own way. Some are really funny, some are sad and some are just epic and interesting. The cowboy + space combination was really great if you ask me. I totally enjoyed the story and was really sad because there wasn't more and not everything was explained. That is actually\
          \
        the only reason why i give it a 8 out of 10.\
Characters 9/10\
Characters in this anime are really great, not because they are \"cool\" or something. I'm talking about the different kinds of characters they made, and all of them special on their own and all them together make the perfect combination. The balance between funny/cool/sad and and and was perfect. I only wish i could learn more about every character, cause their individual story and past is such touching.\
Music: 10/10\
Giving it a 10 because i'm a huge Jazz/Blues/Metal fan and this anime had all of it. I was thinking that such music couldn't fit that great with anime, but it really can, and this anime is the proof for it.\
Animation: 9/10\
It was made in the 90's and for that, it had animations that are really nice made, from the movement of the characters to the fighting scenes and the surroundings, the space and the nature...it was all really nice to see and watch.\
I respect them for making it with such quality even back then.\

    First review here, new to MAL, and maybe not read that much. But still, allow me to give my point.\
At the time of watching Cowboy Bebop, I was watching animes since a lot of time, and I was watching many at the same time. The kind of period when you were following more than the half of the series in a season. Finally I got tired of that, and the enjoyment was not the same. And then I wanted to watch Cowboy Bebop.\
Why is Cowboy Bebop such a great anime? Why is it considered as a masterpiece? I wanted to know, I wanted to be\
          \
        part of it -if there was something to be a part of. But still, I couldn't forget Angel Beats. All my friends were telling me \"man, it's so awesome\". Well, check it out, it got only a 5 on my list. I'm not THE guy, but still, I was bored by this \"masterpiece\", or whatever my friends were telling me.\
So what, I started Cowboy Bebop, let the magic do its stuff alright? So I was in. It's nice, I like it. I don't see any masterpiece here but hey, who cares, we'll see later. Oh the episode is already finished? Well, I played the second. And the third. And again and again. Watching the show wasn't that amazing. But I was so in it... When the last episode finished, I understood. I realized I watched something amazing. I haven't felt something like that since my first shots with series like Steins;Gate or Madoka.\
Let me explain more: everything is just perfectly right, at the right time, with the right tempo and the best way to do it. It's not just something remarkable that you can point out, like SAO's first season is wonderful, but the ALO season is quite useless and really bad. Everything here is just fucking right (forgive me).\
The story is wonderful, from the start to the end, including every background introduced. This is a point were old series can be boring, because the pace is slow, there are useless episodes. In Cowboy Bebop, forget it. Every episode is right, and the progression is really good. When you finish an episode, you sure want the next one. So it's a 10 I guess.\
The sound is fantastic. Why? Because it's jazz and blues. What could be cooler than that? Seriously guys, the sound design is great, and the soundtrack is 20% cooler than any other. Go for it! And thank you Yoko, I love you.\
The characters. Well, it goes with the story to me, mostly because each character has a good personnality, they understand each other, their interactions are right. They are deep, they smoke (oh my god they smoke it's so cool! I don't but it's so fucking cool!)... I don't know what to say, they're perfect! They just fit right in the global atmosphere of the show.\
It's obviously an overall 10. No less. Because when you start Cowboy Bebop, you finish Cowboy Bebop. It's just amazing, and you have to realize it, at least when you finish it.\

    After watching first episode, I thought this is just another episodic animes, which doesn't have any relation with one another. But it wasn't. It will take you by surprise, by how the story travels, how the characters relate, how the story is or the best of all, how the awesome sound gels with the story and give it a high value. I prefer this to any anime newcomer and I don't deny it will take them as a surprise.\
Story: 8/10\
The first few episodes you will feel like, is there any story at all. But I bet, it is, and damn what a story it is.\
          \
        At first glance, it is just another bounty hunter in alternate universe, but it so much more than that. And it is hard to explain without giving spoilers, so I contain myself not to reveal, but it is one hell of a story.\
Art: 8/10\
I was quite awestruck with the art style. Can't believe it came a decade ago, but nonetheless, it is refreshing. It is far better than lot of crap, that is being aired these days.\
Sound: 9/10\
One of the best OST in anime,I have ever heard. Don't go by my Anime List, I have heard a lot and it is easily one of the best. I seriously doubt this show would have received such accolades if not for the OST.\
Character: 8/10\
Characters are unique yet not so hard to understand. Each of the have nice back story which unfold over time. And all of them all excellent and it cruise along with the story. It compliments the story and does great job.\
Enjoyment: 9/10\
Damn, this anime has everything. Humor, Action and what not. I thoroughly enjoyed it and except a couple of filler episodes, I was totally blasted away with the show. I binge-watched the show after certain episode. as I couldn't wait any longer. It is seriously addictive.\

    Frankly, I'm not sure how I can do a show like Cowboy Bebop justice in reviewing it in such tiny space. I think Cowboy Bebop is absolutely a product of genius. I think genius minds conceived and executed the concepts, story, and production of this series, and I believe it will always mean a great deal to me. I say this with the utmost concern for nostalgia and trying to disappate it, judging the show by its merits and not for the time at which I watched it and how radical it was at the time, but rather for what it continues to be based\
          \
        on its true merits. \
For one, I can see why others may dislike elements of the show, but those are the same elements I think are justified. The show is episodic, yes, but rather than being a bunch of completely unrelated adventures that just feature the core cast in different situations, the episodes are more like a series of short little films that each reveal a little more of the bigger picture, not necessarily of the main underlying plot, but something much more important, which is the world and atmosphere, the environment and attitudes which are pervasive in the show. The very lives of the characters are \"episodic\", but an episode rarely ends without having made some headway in unveiling more of the tapestry of this world the characters live in. \
The main plot, the plot of Spike's past with the Red Dragon, that's something that keeps together the threads, but ultimately only exemplifies- well, perhaps more than that, epitomizes- the grander attitude of the entire work. Given more time to breath, perhaps a more traditionally strong narrative would  have worked its way out, which is probably the only flaw I can find with this show. However, it's barely a flaw, because it serves as a great and tragic sword of Damocles over the throne of the viewer. However, unlike that sword, it does certainly strike, and surely, and with consequence. \
The production values are quite breathtaking, some still by today's standards. The music is especially spellbinding. The show is very stylish, and so more cynical folks may be lured into believing the show is \"style over substance\", but the style becomes part of its substance, much in the way a Tarintino film both indulges in and skewers pop art culture. \
It's a show that feels almost as new every new time I watch as it did the first time. Sure, now I've been exposed to several anime that closely rival its greatness. But none of them quite manage to match or surpass it. \
Cowboy Bebop is a stellar series. Perhaps the most representative of what anime can accomplish, It is both entertaining and provocative. It's a rousing jazzy ballad of the bizarre and the sorrowful. It's a must see for anyone.\

    This was the first anime I ever watched that made me completely re-evaluate what was possible in an animated medium. Not only that but despite the improvements in computers and technology that have allowed anime to become more visually astouding, cowboy bebop managed to achieve the same levels of detail and motion of modern anime over a decade ago.\
Do not approach cowboy bebop as being anime. It is animated, but really it is more like live action then a cartoon. The creators of this show did not skimp when it came to fully animating fight scenes, space battles, or even some of the more idle\
          \
        moments. There is never a moment where footage is recycled or cheesy backgrounds go flying by while characters strike a pose, nor are there any chibi or emoted moments.\
Cowboy Bebop is also best if not rushed through, there IS an overall story arc, but most of the episodes are self contained, and do not really require rapid succession. Also when you complete this anime you will surely feel that the show is concluded, and that a sequel or serialization of the series is unnecessary. This show is good enough to re-watch and still find the same enjoyment as the first time you saw it.\
Usually its difficult to fully decide how to rank anime since there are many ways to do it, such as by overall plot (i HATE cop-out endings which are typical of most shows.. curse you school rumble!), quality of art/animation/ visual excellence, music, voice talent, dub (if applicable), characters/character development, and something that is sometimes neglected is depth (how much do you have to allready know to fully enjoy an anime). However, Cowboy Bebop excels in every one of these areas, so it makes it easy for me to give this show 10's across the board, it truly is a masterpiece, and is not as difficult as EVA to fully appreciate, as it does not require you to wikipedia info on Jewish Mythology, Kabalism, Sephiroths, ect. and can be watched in English without sacrificing any aspect of the show, which also makes this show a great candidate for newbies to serious (non serialized) anime.\
ON A SPECIAL NOTE:\
Yoko Kanno is quite possibly one of the greatest film composers, and wrote a ludicrous amount of FULL LENGTH music for this show. If the quality of the anime isn't enough to get your rocks off there are about 8 cd's worth of top notch music, (mostly jazz, blues, and gospel) all origional work composed for this series which I also recommend to you audiophiles. The Seatbelts are awesome...\

    As a child, Cowboy Bebop was an animation that \"I didn't get\"; it was focusing on a much bigger picture that wasn't tied to explosions and intense action. Now as an adult and rewatching the series. I am convinced that it is one of the greatest animation/shows ever made. There is a mastercraft work of how this show delivers its ideas and characters that we often overlook or take for granted today. The main character Spike Speigel is no superhero or beefed up multi-colored character, but rather a cocky, lazy and sometimes efficient bounty hunter. The brilliance in this setup however is that Spike feels\
          \
        more human and relates more to me than any character in animation I have yet to see. His past and his attitude all reflect a sort of Han Solo anti hero style that makes him compelling to watch. Of course Ein, Edward, Valentine and Jet are also great characters to watch too as their backstories give just enough to wet the palate of your imagination and leaves them open ended for you to decide for yourself what their lives are like.\
In a world where anime can take to monstrous heights and commitment where watching hundreds of episodes can be a huge deterrent for newcomers, Cowboy Bebop only comprises of a single season and carries far more impact and power than any I had watch even now. This is not to overshadow other shows that have their own moments, but to see something so short get so much right is why some, myself included, consider it a masterpiece. The opening is iconic and really is one of the best intros to any show (including non-anime) that you could ever have, with jazz and blues mixed and with a touch of this Wild Western grit that really hooks you right in. \
Of course there are always flaws to every show and this one is no exception. While the artwork and design is still strong overall, there are some animations that have seen age and can be a bit silly despite a possible serious tone. Not every episode has the same quality (which all still rank above well done anyways) given so it's a matter of looking far more into the themes and concepts to take more from it. Aside from some nitpicks, the show still remains a staple to animation done at it's peak. 10/10s are often misunderstood by people as \"perfect\" but nothing truly is; it's just a representation of how a craft is fine tuned to deliver compelling pieces of art and characters that we take away from. A gigantic explosion will always be trumped by a finger gun by a dying man as he shows his last cocky attitude to the viewer. \
Cowboy Bebop is outstanding in it's entirety. Nothing is weak or dull for a single episode. The characters and their backgrounds are all wonderfully interesting and have a huge sense of relativity to ourselves. We often see anime show teens that fight for their emerging adulthoods and being as changed people. Cowboy Bebop shows adults that don't change and the struggles of living in such a world that it makes it even far better. Watch this animation, there is a sadness and yet engrossing tale to be told that is outstanding in every sense of the word.  \

    \"Whatever your past, you still have a future.\"\
One of the main characters Spike, says this in a particular episode of this series. This line stayed with me throughout the rest of the series & resonated during certain episodes. Eventually, this line formed what I thought was the big question that forms the plot of this of the show: Can you truly feel alive and have a future if you are constantly reminded of the past and how corrupted the world maybe you yourself are?\
This question surrounds the main characters (Spike, Lee, Faye, and Edward) and some secondary characters they meet as they travel the galaxy\
          \
        hunting criminals with bounties on a ship called The Bebop. Each main character has interesting personalties and mysterious pasts that gradually get revealed as the series goes on.\
Spike is a tough, aloof guy with impulsive tendencies who can handle a gun, pilot a ship, and do martial arts. He is also empathetic in toward others in a big brother kind-of way. Jet is a pilot and mechanic who equally tough with guns, level headed (rarely impulsive) and empathetic in a fatherly way. Faye is a woman who is frivolous with money, has avoidance tendencies, and can handle a gun and won't hesitate to use her feminine charms to make other men drop their guard. Last but not least, Ed is an androgynous and energetic genius hacker who is very free-spirited and child-like.\
As for the secondary characters, many are notable because they either serve as commentary on the real world in and/or they are sympathetic. One example is an animal rights group that threatens to turn people into monkeys unless they stop hunting a certain animal. Another notable aspect of the secondary characters is that they are diverse in body, race, gender, sexual orientation, age, and personality. The depiction of gay and intersex people in this anime is really progressive when you consider that the anime was made in the late 90's. Also, the way many dark-skinned characters are sprinkled throughout the anime is nice too b/c they are rarely seen in anime. \
Besides the plot and characters, the world building is really creative because it mixes several genres including spaghetti westerns, sci-fi, noir, and in one episode slasher films. This created the major themes of the anime (nostalgia and freedom) and makes you want to keep watching to see what the characters will encounter next.\
In addition to the plot, characters, and world building, the soundtrack is incredible. Composed by Yoko Kanno, the soundtrack is rooted in jazz (specifically bebop jazz), but also features other genres like heavy metal and a dash of J-Pop. The fast-paced upbeat bebop jazz really compliments action scenes well. Furthermore, the opening title theme & its visuals are truly striking and memorable.\
Last but not least, the animation is really beautiful at times and not so beautiful at others. The beautiful moments  are focused on the sky, like in one scene where Spike is smoking while watching the sunset. The not-so-beautiful moments come during the jump to hyperspace.\
Overall, this was a really entertaining and enjoyable anime. If you are interested in sci-fi or saw Samurai Champloo first like I did & enjoyed it, then give this anime a try. \

What makes an anime unforgettable? Characters, to be short and thick. Cowboy Bebop is one of the best animations of all time because, in its 26 episodes of 20 minutes each, it manages to reach the soul of the spectator in edges that the spectator himself was unaware of being possible to be reached, even more by a work designed. Shinichiro's anime has style - a lot of jazz! -, humor and drama pervaded by quality and especially of a tone of its own, standing out on any list of best anime and making it unique.\
In this sense, the design owes much\
          \
        to its beautiful technical aspects. The animation of the action scenes, especially in Spike's fight scenes and in space duels, is breathtaking, especially given the year of the 1998 anime release. It goes so far as to outdo many (!) Current animations. Example of this soon sees in the first episode, where we know the style of the hairy and lazy Spike - an unforgettable image, although banal. Combining such quality with creativity in architecting an incredible range of scenarios, ranging from the most megalomaniac to the intimate.\
My overhaul is 10 in any aspects, in anytime.\

Note 2: This review may have small spoilers.\
 Cowboy Bebop is a totally original anime, is not an adaptation of a manga, light novel or anything before, was written and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe and the director of the brilliant soundtrack was Kobayashi Katsuyoshi.\
Story (8/10): Cowboy Bebop tells the story of four bounty hunters trying to make a living catching wanted criminals and handing them to the police. Cowboy Bebop works in a way different from others animes, no arcs or anything like that, each episode is a different story with different\
          \
        characters being added. Each episode they try to catch a wanted criminal or has a backstory of the main characters, there are some exceptions where the episodes follow in sequence with the 1st part and the 2nd part, the story is simple, however interesting, you see several different cases each episode and also the backstory of the main characters, but for me is the weakest point of the anime, because I prefer the division by arcs.\
Art / Animation (8/10): considering that this is an anime 1998, the animation is very good and fluid, the well-designed characters and each very different from the other, not only in the characters design, the clothes too, action scenes are impressive too, very well made, in melee combat and also when they use firearms, speaking of fire, also very well done and lively, vibrant and bold colors, the smoke is also amazing, the space ships and design are also very good, the animation is very good indeed, but also has its small technical problems like all animation, but does not hurt one bit the experience.\
Soundtrack (10/10): undoubtedly the most positive point of Cowboy Bebop, the soundtrack is jazz, blues and other popular music of the 80's and 90's, blends perfectly with the anime, sometimes the soundtrack is a bit of the old west style for a change, which is also very well made, the action scenes and especially in drama scenes you are impressed with such art work. It is truly a masterpiece.\
Characters (9/10): I liked all the main characters, they are \
interesting, each with its strong and aggressive personality, taking Ed, she is very cute, spike is undoubtedly the most interesting, he seems unconcerned, but is more troubled by his past of the group, he is very skilled in melee combat, besides being a great shooter and also a talent with ships, Faye Valentine is extremely greedy and \"selfish\" always does everything to get along, but Faye inside is a child who does not know his past or \"the place that she should return\", she is not good in melee combat, but is good with ships fihts, Faye never had a intense gun battle to I evaluate his ability, but the little I've seen, she's good. Ed is just Ed, she's a hacker child who lived in an \"orphanage\" before being recruited to the Bebop, Ed is the typical noisy children, and live always hungry, Jet is the oldest of the group, owner of Bebop, who has a history with the police, but due to some events decides to become a bounty hunter, Jet always tries to be show the tough guy, but he cares a lot about his partner Spike, who lives just chasing his past and Jet does not agree with this, prefer Spike go ahead, Jet never had a melee combat, much less in a shootout, the to count on one hand the times he took action without I doubt the 2nd character with less focus i the anime, behind Ed.\
Overall (9/10): \
I strongly recommend Cowboy Bebop if you like an anime with lot of action, drama, and a perfect soundtrack, undoubtedly an anime epoch and one of the best I've ever seen.\

    What to say about this anime that hasn't already been said?\
I finished CB not so long ago, and it quickly became my favorite anime so far, and for very good reasons. \
Story: 9/10\
The storytelling in this anime is one of its crowning achievements. It follows the crew of the Bebop and their struggle to make a living out of bounty hunting, showing a different \"case\" in almost every episode. There's a criminal on the loose, they go out to get him, at some point things go wrong (no wonder there's a recurrent theme of luck/lack of luck in this show) and after all they've done\
          \
        they either get a very small bounty, waste it all in one day, or get nothing at all. It sounds comical and even repetitive, but trust me, it's not. And that's because CB is a character-driven show - each of this \"cases\" serve to reveal a thing or two about the main characters, and how they deal with their past, which is, for most of them, pretty tragic. The \"main\" plot, however, is focused on Spike Spiegel, his forbidden romance, his downfall and his ascension. And it is beautifully done. It doesn't rely on clichés to get an emotional reaction out of you, it does not spoonfeed you with everything you need to know, it follows the \"show, don't tell\" rule to a tee... BUT exactly because of that it can also be a little slow in the beginning, so you have to be aware of that when you decide to watch it.\
Characters: 9/10\
The one word I can say to describe the characters in Cowboy Bebop is REAL. They look and feel real. My biggest surprise was Faye Valentine. At first she looks like a shallow woman who's willing to do anything to survive, but as the plot progresses and you get to know her past, you notice how complex she actually is. I was only a little disappointed with the lack of focus given to Ed, who could've been a little more developed, and Julia, who felt to me was just there to be Spike's love interest. Vicious, the main villain, also felt a bit cliché. Apart from that, most of the characters, including Spike, of course, are brilliant and very well developed. And I'm not talking only about the main characters. A lot of the side characters are also very interesting and memorable.\
Art: 10/10\
This anime was made in 1998, and it has better art than many anime from the 2010's. This is certainly something. The animation is incredibly fluid, the colors are spot on... I really have no complaints AT ALL in this area.\
Sound: 10/10\
CB's soundtrack is one of its most famous aspects, and rightly so. It's very unique and varied, with songs ranging from jazz to bossa nova (!). Yoko Kanno's score brings personality to a very music-oriented show, making an already memorable scene become even more memorable. I still listen to some of the songs in this soundtrack daily. That's how good it is. \
Enjoyment: 9/10\
Like I mentioned before, Cowboy Bebop has a rather slow start. But it gets better, and even at its most \"boring\" moments, it has a level of intrigue that will make you come back to it and eventually enjoy it a lot. It's definitely a very rewatchable show, and it gives a lot of \"food for thought\" too. \
Overall, there's nothing else for me to say about this anime. It's a MASTERPIECE, in every sense of the word, and a definite must-watch for anime fans, and even for those who don't like anime. \
Cowboy Bebop is a 10/10!\

    Cowboy Bepop.\
There's something about this anime that sets itself apart from everything else out there. From its amazing atmosphere to its near-flawless character design, this anime is a surefire way to make a boring weekend a lot less boring. I had heard so much about this show from many different sources, but I had never tried to watch it. Only because of a sudden urge to watch anime was I able to fully grasp how good this show is.\
Let me just say that the intro is definitely something to drool over like some mindless fanboy. And I don't say that often. A good intro may\
          \
        not affect the story, but it can really draw in viewers.\
Take a look for yourself (Don't worry, it's just an intro. No spoilers here. I DO have a heart, you know.)\

SOUND:\
9/10\
The soundtrack really is unique, and I haven't seen anything else quite like it. It can go from smooth and classy to quick and dangerous in a matter of a few seconds and you wouldn't know what hit you. The soundtrack alone is a good reason why you should watch this anime.\
ART:\
9/10\
As for the art? It might be a bit outdated, but... you know, that's because it came out in 1998. But even for its release date, it showed an exceptional amount of care and passion. The little details were what drew me in, not to mention the downright awesome fight scenes. It's clear there was a lot of dedication that went into this anime and I applaud the makers. Kudos. \
STORY: (Obvious spoilers.)\
10/10\
While the story might seem everywhere to some people, it's clearly meant to be that way. Each story arc offered a unique setting and progression. From an intelligent dog comparable to a human being to a pathogen bomb that has the ability to wipe out an entire population on a planet, you're in for a ride, folks. But I don't want to spoil any more for you. Just know that you'll be missing out if you don't watch this anime.\
CHARACTERS: (Yes. Take all of my virtual yes.)\
The character design and progression is something I rarely see in shows nowadays, excluding some of the more successful shows out there. Those are successful for a reason. I particularly love the smooth personality of the main character, and the uncle-like friendliness (While still possessing copious amounts of badassary) of his companion. There are a few more notable characters, but I'll leave them to you to discover.\
ENJOYMENT?:\
Yes. I enjoyed it. If you haven't already figured that out, then you have now. 10/10, would fangasm over again.\
Nuff' said, really.\

    Cowboy Bebop, is a masterpiece. Anybody who argues otherwise quite obviously doesn't understand the medium. Cowboy bebop is one of the few shows out there that exists so highly in so many people's lists that it has become like a reference point all other anime is graded out of. \
*Person 1* So I just finished Tokyo Weeabho-I mean ghoul.\
*Person 2* Hmm, how many Bebops out of 10 was it?\
*Person 1* Eh, 2-3.\
*Person 2* This analogy is getting old!\
But I think you understand what I mean.\
Let me start with the story, a lot of people could argue that CB is just a bunch of filler, and\
          \
        while they might technically be right, all the filler there serves the purpose of supplying character development which makes the story make sense. It all ties in and that is wonderful.\
Art? Pfft, more like heaven's gloriously profound image of god we just found lying around on Toonami one day.\
Sound?\
2 words, Yoko Kanno.\
Done. \
NEXT!\
Character development as I stated earlier is an integral element of this, as is Yoko Kanno's stunningly jazzy soundtrack and this is one of the few anime out there that rivals NGE in terms of character depth an portrayal.\
Character development is defined as\
\"the change a character undergoes during the course of a story\"\
And in most stories this would apply to character that goes from point A (Us knowing nothing about them) to point B (Us knowing something about them)\
But in Bebop they handle it a bit... Smoother, because there are no time stamps at which we know more about them per se.\
I will just say, like Spike's famous fighting style... It's smooth like water.\
The enjoyment is so far through the roof I can see the toys in the attic, it's just a fun show.\
Overall Bebop is an absolute masterpiece that needs to be seen by anybody and everybody, even people who don't like anime.\
Watch it and enjoy, it's a wild ride.\

    Cowboy Bebop is considered by many to be one of the best and with good reason.\
First of all, Keiko Nobumato (writer of Cowboy Bebop) should feel proud for creating such a wonderful cast of characters.  The show is set in the distant future and follows the many exploits of a crew of bounty hunters.  The show’s central character is Spike Spiegel, a young man who’s slow to exhibit emotion yet quick to rush into danger.  His partner is Jet Black, an x-cop who seems to be the wiser of the two.   Faye Valentine, a strong, confident female bounty hunter, joins\
          \
        the crew a few episodes in, followed several episodes later by a young, energetic kid named Ed, who at first I thought would just end up being an utter annoyance.  Instead, she succeeded on many occasions to bring a smile to my face.  What Nobumato did here was give his viewers a cast of  characters they will never forget.  Whether it be their constant arguing, incessant bantering, or occasional sympathizing, seeing these misfits interact with one another is reason enough to watch.                            \
Though there isn't much in terms of an overlying plot, most of Cowboy Bebop’s 26 episodes won’t fail to satisfy, with plot lines ranging from truly heart-warming to downright dark and dreary.  Instead of bombarding viewers with plot twist after plot twist, Nobumato decided to utilize a different kind of twist.  Throughout the series, he reveals bits and pieces about the characters’ lives before becoming bounty hunters, stuff that the other characters didn't even know.  It’s these episodes where Cowboy Bebop really shines, especially the ones dealing with Spike and a mysterious man by the name of Viscous, the only truly recurring villain in the show.  Though not much concrete is provided about their past relations, their scenes together are some of the highest emotional points of the series.\
Unfortunately, I have little  time left to tell you about Bebop’s slick, stylish fight scenes as well as its robust soundtrack, a great mix of country, jazz, and rock n’ roll.  Because of all this and the show’s wonderfully endearing cast, I see no reason why you shouldn't check it out.  I honestly think it's one of the most broadly appealing Anime around.\
Visual Style- A great example of just how amazing a Japanese Anime can look, all the while never letting the animations get too ridiculous.\
Sound- The Japanese voice-acting is superb, and the soundtrack’s mix of country, jazz, and rock works surprisingly well.\
Characters- The amazing cast and their many scenes together make the entire experience well worth it.\
Plot- There’s really no overlying plot, but most of the episodes still manage to pull you in, especially the ones dealing with the characters’ pasts.  Some of the episodes do end quite abruptly though.\
Lasting Appeal- A wonderful accomplishment that will stick with you for years to come.  Truly one of the best.\

    Honestly anime is very hit and miss with me, either I love it to death or I hate it. This is an anime I love. I think it's a wonderful anime and, all in all I actually enjoyed all the episodes, which almost never happens with me and anime. I binge watched this in 2 days and now understand why this is largely regarded as a classic.\
Story: 10/10\
While the story is of an episodic nature,  every bits helps develop the characters and the universe, and such it doesn't feel filler at all. It's a great mix between sci fi and space opera, and there's\
          \
        effort done to give so credibility to the universe it's set in. Basically, it's set around a crew of bounty hunters in the years 2071, and their travels around the solar system looking for bounties. The setting is quite simple, but it's well executed, and every episodes adds a bit more to the characters stories, so that we learn every time a bit more of their past, and of their tragedies.\
Which brings me to:\
Characters: 10/10\
The story is great in it's own way, but if it works so well it's because it's carried by such a great set of characters. From Ed the tomboyish hacker to Ein the Welsh corgi, every characters add something to the show, making it so much more interesting to watch? They are all well thought out and developed more and more as the series continue, making us learn of their pasts by small bits. The voice acting is great too and brings a lot to the characters. I've only watched the sub, but i've heard the dubs were great so I think I'm going to watch that next, to compare the two. \
Sound: 10/10\
The soundtrack of this show is just amazing. from the OP,  Tanks!, that's energetic af and sets the tone for whats to come, and the ending song, the Real Folks Blues, it really sets up a great atmosphere. The background music itself is amazing too, and helps move the story along. It's not a forgettable soundtrack, that's for sure, and every bit of it, from the harmonica tune to the sax solo  works very well with it all. The ending song  changes twice, only for one episode each, but it works really well and shows significant twist in the plot. Especially after the last episode. The ending song there is just perfect to stare at  your screen...\
Art: 10/10 \
For a show made in 1998 the art and animation aged remarkably well. It doesn't look too dated and the colour scheme helps to set up this western-like vision of the future. The animation is smooth and fluid, and the fight scenes, in space or otherwise, are really a sight to behold. The characters designs are also memorable, and the background looks awesome. I found some of the skies particularly beautiful.\
Enjoyement: 10/10\
I think it's a trully enjoyable show. It can be comedic, serious, sometime even sentimental \
( cause let's be real at the end you do care about what happens to the characters) but there's not one episode I didn't enjoy. They might be weird, funny or serious, I think they all have their appeal and such the show has a great binge watch capacity.\
Overall: 10/10\
I honestly recommend this to everyone looking to start  a new show. It's just great, and for me at least truly deserves to be put among the masterpieces of anime. Of all the anime I saw so far I won't hesitate to say that this was by far the best yet.\

    There are only two anime series/OVA/movie I've seen.  Cowboy Bebop and Fullmetal Alchemist are the only ones.\
Cowboy Bebop follows Spike, Jet, Faye and Edward as bounty hunters aboard the spaceship Bebop.  Now onto the many reasons why this anime series is perfect.\
First the story:  Which blends comedy, drama, action, adventure, Sci-fi and even some romance perfectly like no other show.  Most of the series are one episode stories yet I think are all connected in the development of the characters.  The story of each individual episode is done perfectly giving a beginning a middle and end with no lose ends.\
          \
         The action is brilliant and I still haven't seen anything to compare to it.  Finally we have the last few episodes leading to the ending.  I won't give anything away to the people who unfortunately haven't seen this series, just it will blow you away.\
Second the characters:  Again done perfectly.  Each character has their own unique personality who grows as the show goes along.  Spike who used to work for Red Dragon crime organization and his haunted by his past.  Jet a former police officer who is now working with a criminal, and his haunted by the mistake he made in the past.  Faye who awakes from a 54 year cryogenic sleep with no memory of her past, who lives for the moment.  Finally Edward a eccentric computer genius, who ran away from her father.  Each character brings life to the series and draws you in caring about what happens to each of them.\
Third the animation:  The animation done by Sunrise is simply brilliant, and is still amazing after 10 years.\
Forth the soundtrack:  The music to the series is the perhaps the greatest soundtrack to anime series ever.  It has a little of everything from Rock, classic, Jazz, Heavy Metal and others.  Each adding something extra to the series.  I even have the soundtrack to the series\
Fifth the Influence:  Cowboy Bebop has Influenced many series much like Trigun.  Shows like BLACK LAGOON, SAMURAI CHAMPLOO, and others.  I think that's a great compliment.\
Overall Cowboy Bebop is a perfect anime series and is must to any anime fan. \

    Short Review: (I know, I know, I gave Cowboy Bebop less than a 10/10) Almost everything about this anime is of extremely high quality, especially considering we're talking about an anime that's more than 15 years old. Pitch-perfect English dub, a vast bout incredible OST, unique characters, and incredibly fluid animation. HOWEVER. I did not expect an episodic story, and this led me to almost hate the anime at times. \
Looooooooong review: \
Story:\
Before watching this anime, my expectations for Cowboy Bebop were astronomically high, pun somewhat intended. Having known this cult classic's reputation, I was sorely disappointed to find out Cowboy Bebop is an episodic\
          \
        series, something that was conveniently left out in every review I had come across (I don't really like episodic shows). I was expecting this epic space opera tale filled with drama and complex characters, which Bebop only fully delivered the latter. A lot of this anime's story goes something like, \"There's a new bounty on a criminal!\" \"Let's catch him/her!\" Stuff goes wrong, fights ensue, then things look up, the problem is (somewhat) solved, and in the end, the crew gets (almost) nothing. Episodes that do not involve trying to catch a criminal usually involve the antics of one of the crew members, something which the writers must have had a lot of fun coming up with. Occasionally, some other stuff is sprinkled in, mostly involving someone/thing from one of the crew's past. This is where the main theme of the show comes in, as every crew member gets at least 1 episode dealing with their past and how they handle it. This method of storytelling left much to desired from me, because for every great and very enjoyable episode, there was one that made me feel very annoyed and facepalm a lot. And there were only about 10 \"plot\" episodes in the whole series. However, the anime did keep me interested by ending the episodes in a way that most people wouldn't expect. This was probably the most interesting part of the show. The narrative of Cowboy Bebop does not ever do the \"info dump\" many sci-fi series are guilty of. Because of this, the writing may seem \"masterful\" but for me, a few times I spent the first few minutes of an episode wondering just what was going on. Once again, maybe I just wasn't \"mature enough\" for this anime. Cowboy Bebop makes the unique genres of Space Western and Neo-Noir work together exceedingly well, which is probably what contributed to this anime's popularity. As for the ending, I don't think I could have written a better ending to this anime. It's just one of those where it lightly hangs in the air, waiting for its full effect to sink in. It felt like everything was tied up in the story, but not in the \"fast-forward\" way others shows end.\
Characters:\
I do give praise to the characters in Cowboy Bebop, as every one of them is unique and not lazily written. They all have their deep motivations for why they do what they do, and it's usually isn't a cliche reason. The best part about this is as you see more about the characters, it becomes more interesting to watch their dynamic, them growing and reacting to their surroundings, because everyone is so non-cliche. Every member of the Bebop crew is very likable and has a fleshed-out personality, with Spike being effortlessly smooth and cool, Jet being a (reluctant) voice of reason, Faye being the strong female lead with no romantic feelings for Spike (shocker), and Ed being ridiculously enigmatic and childish, but never annoying. Even Ein had his moments of being very necessary to what was going on throughout this anime. It's because everyone aboard the Bebop is so different from one another, this rag-tag team feeling did push the story into many great moments and episodes. They highlight each other's flaws, but also make each other stronger, despite all their bickering. Secondary characters are usually in only one episode each, because this is an episodic series. Characters siding with our protagonists usually change by the end of an episode, and the \"bad guys\" were all unique, mostly memorable, and fun to watch get chased down by the Bebop crew. The real bad guys, Vicious and the Red Dragon syndicate, made interesting antagonists, despite their roots in western movie cliches. They were threatening, but not enough that it becomes the focus of the show. All the character designs were both unique and creative, which brings me to my next point...\
Art:\
I really do have to tip my hat (if I was wearing one right now) to the art style of this anime. It's very 90's, while having its own unique style. Yes, it very much looks like anime, but the style is also westernized, blending the two in a beautiful harmony. The one thing that Cowboy Bebop really left an impression on me is that the art (actually, most of this anime) is undeniably stylish and unique. I really loved how all the sci-fi elements looked gritty and realistic, while the aspects closer to present-day were incredibly detailed, almost as if the animators took real buildings and setting and transformed them into anime. The art perfectly blends the western and sci-fi elements in a way I would have thought would never have worked. \
Animation:\
Cowboy Bebop is one of the last anime series to be made entirely by traditional cel animation, drawing each and every single frame by hand. But for it's time, the animation is incredibly fluid and consistent throughout the entire series, something which was a problem for other shows using the same animation method (cough Evangelion cough). Heck, I'd even say the animation quality of Cowboy Bebop is equal to, if not greater than some of the stuff that's being made today, 16 years later. All the action is as effortless as Spike's fighting style, and the animators took great care in making sure everything in this anime looked realistic, somewhat gritty, and absolutely amazing. Only very few clips of recycled animation were used, and the only ones I can think of are when the Bebop flies through hyperspace and those yellow gates. Clearly Cowboy Bebop had a large budget, and it was used to its full potential by not skimping on animation.\
Voice:\
This is a no-brainer, but I say watch Cowboy Bebop dubbed. Part of the reason this anime is so famous here in the west is because of its amazing dub. While it actually took me a few episodes to get used to the voices, especially when a new member of the crew was introduced, the dub quickly grew on me, but did did hit a few bumps in the road here and there. Steve Blum is probably most well known for playing Spike, and the same can be said about Wendee Lee playing Faye. All the voice actors clearly had a lot of fun dubbing this, and they gave it their all and it payed off. The script is witty, the delivery for all the actors was (95% of the time) pitch-perfect, and added to the style and overall feel of the anime. The dub just feels so much more stylish, while reading subs usually just give you the raw translation. With a western prime audience in mind, Bandai made sure this dub was of the best quality, and it is one that is considered the best dubs in all of anime. Even Shinichiro Watanabe, the Japanese director, says the English dub is better. \
Music:\
The opening theme, \"Tank!\" has lent itself to be one of the most iconic anime openings of all time, being a) instrumental and b) as stylish and jazzy as the rest of the show. In case the title of this anime didn't clue you in, almost the entire soundtrack is inspired from jazz or classic western movie music. Even some of the episode names are classic American rock songs (Bohemian Rhapsody) or albums (Toys in the Attic). Yes, this does lend this anime \"cool\" points, but the sheer number of tracks in the OST (93!!!) means that you won't hear a lot of them very often. There are a few exceptions, like the music box theme whenever Spike's past came up. Some songs are slow, some are quick, some are sad, and some are kinda goofy. Yoko Kanno has proven that she can compose a completely amazing soundtrack, and this is one of her most famous works. The first ending theme actually wasn't that impressive, but the second ending theme, used only for the last episode, had my mouth gaping open by how it matched the tone of the show's ending perfectly. It very much reminded me of \"The World of Midnight\" from Black Lagoon.\
Execution:\
I failed to recognize while I was watching this anime that it was designed to appeal to a western audience with its episodic storytelling and not being like typical anime of the time. While most seasoned anime fans and critics regard Cowboy Bebop as a \"cult classic,\" the two words I would use to describe this anime are stylish and westernized. I don't think Cowboy Bebop necessarily failed, I just went in with the wrong mindset and impressions of the show. In other words, Cowboy Bebop's reputation precedes itself, but not by a long shot. Sure, this anime passes style with flying colors, but it seemed to me at first to lack the meat and potatoes, aka an overarching rich story. But I am one to agree this would make a good (but not the best) first anime and a great way to get fathers or brothers into anime. \
My Enjoyment:\
Because I went into this anime with such high expectations, my enjoyment was hindered very much so. As I clicked on the next episode, I kept telling myself, \"Okay, this is it. We're actually going to see some overarching plot or an entertaining episode.\" only to be disappointed 25 minuted later. I'm a bit hesitant to call this anime \"overrated,\" but again, I just think my problem was that I went into this show with the wrong mindset. Sure, there were plenty of entertaining episodes, but there were more that had disappointed or just made me feel weird (not in the good way). The creativity involved for the more slice-of-life episodes is remarkable, but I can't help but feel a sort of grudge against this anime for \"letting me down.\" Sure, I could go back and watch this series again (with the proper mindset) but I think my enjoyment of this series was ruined from the moment I caught wind of this anime's extreme reputation. Cowboy Bebop is the kind of anime to just pick up an episode or two, kick back, and relax. Enjoy the memorable characters, creative episodes, vast soundtrack, and the excellent dub. But don't watch it because \"You're not a real anime fan if you haven't seen Cowboy Bebop hurrr hurrr.\" That is NEVER a good reason to watch an anime, and if anyone says something like that to you, tell them to shut up. \

    The nonchalant Spike, The righteous Jet, The sneaky Faye, and witty Edward....\
These beloved characters have in-printed themselves onto my heart slowly but surely.\
CowBoy Bebop is an anime that was recommended to me by various sources. Knowing that the anime was about 14 years old, I was hesitant to start it up. Eventually, with the consistent nagging of my buddies and fellow anime fan, I started Cowboy Bebop.\
Took me three days to marathon it, and boy what a ride it was!!\
Story:\
There only has been a few animes that were in a “episodic” style that I really enjoyed. Mushi shi was one, xxxholic was another, and I\
          \
        guess we can count Tsubasa chronicles as another. Besides those cherished anime, I have been left unimpressed by that style of storytelling. Little did I know that cowboy Bebop was the revolutionary anime that introduced this style to the animation world. Not only did it introduced, but it was executed perfectly most of the time.\
There were episodes that I could have done without, some of the earlier episodes to be specific, and few random episodes in the mid section of the anime. This is not a problem since most the episodes were great and done a very aesthetically pleasing manner. \
The story in these episodes were less about plot and more about characters. These mini stories helped us understand and get to know the main characters in a unique manner. Nothing was handed to us, we had to decipher a lot of their backstory episode by episode, and we had to piece the stories ourselves.\
In the end, however, everything came in a crash, and the entirety of these small plots came into a flashy dystopic climax!\
Art/Animation:\
The animation was flawless. Even without considering that this a show made 14 years ago, I was thoroughly impressed with the fluidity of every episodes. All of the fighting sequences left me breathless, and kept me at the edge of my feet!\
The character designs reminded me a lot of Samurai Champloo...and I was pleasantly surprised to read that there are of similar origins, same director. \
I will add that this anime, out of all the animes that I've watched so far, had the greatest amount of diversity in terms of characters. It was not all just Japanese people who conquered and repopulated the universe but also Indians, Arabs, Africans, and Americans ( thinking of a certain cowboy hehehe)\
I really enjoyed seeing this diversity because that is more representative of how the world actually is.\
A lot of anime directors nowdays should take not of how to budget and direct these episodes, CB showed the way. This is how you get it done guys!\
Sound:\
Just like every anime review that I do, I stress the importance of sound/bgm as a contributor of the making of a masterpiece. Without a great accompany soundtrack, an anime cannot be called a masterpiece in my eyes. Sound sets the atmosphere faster than any of the senses that we have. It is of the utmost importance to have the best compatible soundtrack.\
CowBoy Bebop doesn't disappoint on this end either. The soundtrack is strong. It is a mixture of different sounds from the sixties, a lot of jazzy records, and soothing blues. The soundtrack really contributes to the effects that CB is portraying, the smoothness of Spike, the sneakiness of Faye, and the tough righteousness of Jet are all represented well through the music. There are couple of pieces that I will later try to find for personal enjoyment. Really smooth soundtrack. \
Characters:\
This anime is made by and for the characters. We don't have any ingenious plot line, or any non-fulfilling fan service...what we have is plenty of character development. Obviously, this is going to be the biggest part of the review since I will discuss in detail my opinion of each character.\
\
Edward:      Is this a person a girl or a boy? The ambiguity of her gender plagued my thoughts throughout the show. Anytime I was convinced that she was a girl, someone would come along and challenge those beliefs. In all practicality, she was probably a girl. I really expected a lot from her when she was introduced, she seemed witty and smart, but also caring. She, however, did not live up to my expectations, probably becoming the least of the main characters in CB.\
Faye:     I didn't enjoy her at first. She seemed too snotty for her own good. Usually characters of her type bring nothing but randomness and chaos to a story line, and I've never been a fan of that. She did surprise me around mid series however. She was a lot more deep than what I gave her credit for. Without delving into any spoilers, I found myself empathizing with her emotional distraught about her past life and ended up becoming a big fan of hers. I wish that she would have had more episodes where she was a bit more honest with her feelings, the tough girl act can only take you so far, but due to the 26 episode limit, I was thoroughly satisfied by the end with this character's development.\
Jet:         My favorite character of the series. Jet is a balding middle age gentleman with a huge biceps and a big personality to follow along with it. At first, I thought he was going to stay one dimensional, usually characters of his type are not examined enough in anime, but again CB surprised me by giving me a glimpse of who Jet was in the past, and some of his reasoning. We saw him grow as he finally decided to not look to the past anymore, and I related a lot with that. A lot of the time, in my personal life, I've been tied to the past, whether it was a past version of myself, a past friend, a past job or school...a past lover....I found myself always looking back and reminiscing and it hasn't been until recently that I decided to put the past where it belongs, learn from it, and strive for the future. I love Jet because his development is an incarnation of the feelings that I've also developed. His friendship with Jet was unorthodox but really enjoyable to see. Sometimes, the people with opposite personalities find ways to become the closest of friends. Their constant bickering was like classical music to my ears, and their silence was brutally sad. They seemed to be really good at synchronizing with each other.\
Spike:         The main character of the show, and the man with few words. Spike is a really interesting character because of his nonchalant attitude. It is really enjoyable to see him in action, he is so smooth in his fighting style that you are surprised by his efficiency. He is one smooth mamajama. His story intrigued me the most, I was really curious to know what his relationship to Julia was and why she was so important. Unfortunately, by the end, I didn't see why Julia was so important. It could have been better to maybe have separate episodes with just her, so we could understand better and empathize with who she was. Maybe it wasn't the director's intent for us to understand Julia but rather understand the emotional connection that Spike had with her. If that is the case, then yes, I did get that Spike really loved her...to the point that he would have died a thousand times to be with her. Spike was always indifferent to most situations, but any time Vicious, and Julia was mentioned he would go into ape mode or get moody. Nothing is wrong with that, but I would have liked further knowledge about that story line. I think if I rewatched the series, I would not recall these issues. All in all, I do like Spike as a character, he's funny, witty, and a good person at heart. A classy main character.\
\
Side characters: Most of the side characters were just introduced and left in the same episode, very few carried over to other episode, and I guess that's the point of the episodic format. CB really did a good job of fleshing out these characters during the one shot episodes and making them deep and relatable. This wasn't achieved in all of the episodes, but it was well done in most.  \
Enjoyment:\
The episodes that I enjoyed....I enjoyed to its fullest extent, but the ones that I didn't like were really a drag. Those dragging episodes though were mostly in the first ten episodes. Overall, I really enjoyed the anime. \
I originally gave this anime an 8/10, which is a decent grade, but after taking into consideration the time period when this anime was made, I cannot downgrade the effort and care that was put into making it. I boosted it up to an 9/10...aren't I merciful? :) haha\
Well, the anime wasn't the masterpiece that people made it out to be, I came in with super high expectations, but this was a great anime. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I recommend anyone with a normal concentration span to try CowBoy Bebop out.",

    The Music: Jazz, blues, acoustic ballads, hard rock, country funk. Yoko Kannos' work is pure genius.(You might also be aware of her work from The Ghost in shell series)\
From the opening theme song \"Tank\", to chase sequence music such as \"Bad Dog No Biscuit\", to \"Space lion\" or the awesome \"What planet is this?\". The music is pitch perfect and suits the setting of the anime elegantly.\
The Characters: Cowboy Bebop's characters are as realistic a one can get. What is great about the series is that it maintains the mortality of main characters. This team is not a bunch of all powerful god like super-humans\
          \
        who can kick anyone's ass simply by their \"will power\"   (Goku..cough cough..Naruto cough cough...Shonen cough cough)\
This team is all too real, they have their problems, they can be overpowered and they can die.\
The Voice Actors: I have never seen another anime which compares to the same level of English dub as this this series, okay maybe Baccano!\
The voice actors used have done a really really good job. I just cannot picture Spike Spiegel without Steve Blums' voice in my head.\
I mean really, one of the best dubs evaaarr.\
The Bruce Lee element: Chances are you find Spike Spiegel's fighting style jaw-dropping awesome. Have you ever wondered what what type of style is that?\
It's Jeet Kun do which \"is an electric/hybrid style of no style and philosophy of life founded by martial artist [The great]Bruce Lee.\"\
That is not the best part. Not only is Spike practitoner of Jeet Kun Do but also follows Bruce Lee's philosophy of life.\
Noir-CyperPunk-SpaceWestern: Holy shit, this anime has all three of them. The technology depicted in the anime is fascinating probably because it still uses wires which gives it an interesting aspect because we all know the future will be nothing like that.\
\
Humor: Cowboy Bebop is anything if not funny. The classic Spike and Jet situations are very humorous. Not only that, the recurring characters such as the three old men, and Punch and Judy from the T.V show Big Shot can put a smile to anyone's face.\
For me Cowboy Bebop has evolved beyond as an anime. It is a culture.\

    Going into this series, I was expecting a lot. I was consistently hearing that this was one of the all time greatest animes. I also kept hearing how great its English Dub is, so of course I watched it dubbed. It 's also the first series I've watched to follow a episodic narrative design, where each episode was treated like a miniature movie. So after finally getting to watch this legendary series here's what I thought of it.\
Story:9/10\
Brilliantly written and very sophisticated. The main plot revolves around the main characters' past and it explores that in such a beautiful way. Due to it's narrative design\
          \
        we are given so many memorable episodes with my personal fav being episode 20, \"Pierrot Le Fou,' Each episode contains a different story approach and it gives us different genres. And although it wasn't as action packed as DBZ or Bleach, this series had great and memorable action in particular the shootout scenes. This series also had one of the best conclusions ever, it ended in a bang. The only problem I had here was that it suffered a lil bit from exposition.\
Art:10/10\
This was the one area that impressed me the most. This series came out in the 1990s yet it looks better than most animes I've watched in the 2000s. The animation never lost consistency and it was fluid as water. The movie quality was great as like I said, each episode felt like a short movie. Visuals were great and very detailed and none of the character designs felt out of place. Every character here was drawn in a very realistic way.\
Sound:10/10\
This is where Cowboy Bebop stands out from most animes. For one it has SUPERB voice acting. It wasn't over the top at all and everyone's voice fit and Spike sounded so cool. The dub is so great that I honestly believe it to be superior to the Japanese version. And of course the soundtrack, one of the best any person can hear in ANYTHING. The opening song, ending song, to its beautiful jazz flowing in the background, the music perfectly matched the show's atmosphere. If I was blind and had only my ears, this anime will still heavily satisfy me.\
Character:9/10\
The development here is incredible but what really stands out is that we really connect wit these characters like their actual people. And really love the relationships between the main characters cuz although they don't always get along their all they have and it leads to some emotional moments. The main antagonist here is great cuz although not overly powerful, the character plays a huge impact on the main character. Whenever these two were together you'll almost cry inside cuz their past is so deep.\
Final Verdict\
One word, masterpiece. Simply one of the greatest animated works you can ever find. Cowboy Bebop is just too important to the anime world and its one series that all of us needs to see. This series is all about style, and when it comes to style there's no better anime out there than this. With its beautiful animation, great music, and endearing characters, there's no doubt why Cowboy Bebop is considered to be the landmark title in Anime.\

    As a guy who only recently started having real interest in anime I've tried to create a list of very good animes to start my anime quest and set a good standard, and Cowboy Bebop is certainly one that will be remembered by me for many years to come. \
Nobody I knew watched it, I had no idea of what to expect, except for a good soundtrack, and it was all a new experience to me. I'm usually more interested in fantasy stuff, with superpowers or supernatural beings, but I certainly did not miss that while watching Cowboy Bobop. \
At first glance Spike was the\
          \
        skinny guy with weird hair who tried to look cool and just looked bored most of the time and Jet was the strong guy who had to make up for his partner's laziness and do most of the thinking, but this was not the case. As the seemingly completely disconnected episodes pass, we get to see much more of their pasts and what led them to become what they are now, and it does not happen over 1 or 2 episodes and bam, you know eveything, it builds up from episode to episode, finding out bit by bit about everyone's past. \
Faye Valentine and \"Radical\" Ed are the other 2 members of the Bebop's 4 people crew (not forgetting about the lovely dog named Ein). Faye is a woman that can really take care of herself (most of the times) and has an easy time losing all her money through bad gambling or being held at gunpoint by strange people. Ed is a really weird girl who happens to work much better with her computer than with people, but she is an interesting character whose naivety and disconnection with the situations actually play for her. \
I personally liked the second part of the 26 episodes more. Perhaps it took a few episodes for the characters to build on me? The combination of excellent jazzy soundtrack with unexpected situations and people you don't know very well engaging in unique bounty hunting from episode to episode on different places of the solar system is something you will probably love or hate. I loved it, and the last episode surely made me shed one manly tear (okay, 2 tears). \

    After all these years, I've finally watched Cowboy Bebop. And I have a great time.\
Cowboy Bebop is a classic into the anime world of 26 episodes, Aired in 1996 by the studio Sunrise.\
He was aired in 1996. 1996. Yes it's the third time I write it, but it was an important detail, because I was so amazed by the animation !\
So the first point: the draws and the animation. It's one of these rare pearl in this field.\
It's dynamic, clean, and precise. And God knows we needed this to follow these bounty hunters ! \
I though have already saw all about 90's japanimation, but this\
          \
        anime surprised me, really a good job.\
There is CGI sometimes, but not a nuisance, pretty well-mastered.\
The second striking point for me are the OST. Or do I call them, Insert Song? The large majority of the OST are  already know famous jazz song, it sets a unique atmosphere, very interesting.\
It's by the way the anime slogan \"the work which becomes a new genre itself will be called Cowboy Bebop\" and after finished watch the anime, I think they are true.\
Oh and the opening James Bond's style is awesome!\
Characters are endearing. Excepted Ed who, for me, is here for scenaristic readiness.\
They all have 2 or 3 episodes about their past and other, and it's largely enough.\
When I heard about this anime, I though that it was very serious, dark, and take itselfs too seriously. But hey, humour was here too! And is probably the most revelant side of this anime.\
3-4 Boundy Hunters so poor that they can't eat and have to hunt all the time.\
Plus, interactions between characters are hilarous!\
So, why only 9 ?\
The problem, for me, comes from the genre itselfes. \
The serie are composed of stand alone episodes. And I didn't really like that. It was cool the first part of the serie, but after, you're awaiting for a show which tell something ! And all elements was here: Endearing characters with tragic past, OST, atmosphere.\
But no, there is only a few episodes about their past dispersed through all the serie. I think it's too bad.\
But to conclude, this serie is fun, with an unique atmosphere, excellent OST, endearing characters and perfect 90's animation. A Masterpiece. Hurry on it ! \

Story: 9/10\
Cowboy Bebop is an episodic anime for the most part. While the premise is nothing complicated, the way every episode is delivered is distinct to each other but retains the factors that make this one unique to other series. Repetitions and cliche are rarely seen in Cowboy Bebop, which is very seldom nowadays in anime. The best thing about the story the storytelling is the way the episodic plot is tied with the main story, which is told sparingly but beautifully. It's rare\
          \
        to find an anime with an appealing plot and even rarer to find something with great delivery.\
Art: 8/10\
The art and animation are nothing spectacular compared to today's anime but was definitely better than most that came out in the late 90's. One important thing with Cowboy Bebop is the consistency of the animation. I barely saw any drop off in animation and art quality throughout 26 episodes. It's nice considering a lot of anime in the 90's or earlier weren't as consistent with their visuals. \
Sound: 10/10\
Tank! by The Seatbelts is one of the most iconic anime openings of all time. Cowboy Bebop definitely one of the best anime of all time in terms of sound and music. The soundtrack is simply amazing, it's something many will enjoy. The special thing about the music is the variety and genre and how it's used in every episode. It really sets the tone and feel of each scene, which is done extremely well. Each piece nicely suits its purpose.\
Characters: 10/10\
Cowboy Bebop has an excellent set of characters ranging from the main ones and minor ones. It's the component that makes this series come alive and separate it from other anime. The main characters especially are well done. They're diverse, fascinating, have depth and most important of all, they gel really well together. You don't find a set of main characters like that very easily.  \
Enjoyment: 10/10\
It's been a while since I found an anime that I personally think deserves a 10/10. Many reasons can be given as to why I think this series was such an amazing series for me. You have the story, the music, the characters and just the feel and vibe of the anime. Only a handful of anime has given me this feeling of bliss as I have witnessed something astonishing and dreariness because it's finished. This one's really something else, enjoyment is without question a 10/10\
Final verdict:\
A lot of people claim it to be one of the best series not just of the 90's but of all time. I personally think that it is one of the best things that has ever happened to the anime industry. It's simply spectacular. ",

    I'm not a big fan of episodic anime. I'm also not really a fan of the werstern genre. \
The thing about Bebop is that it is in fact a classic. I can see that. In the same way I am not a big fan of classical music but can recognize the brilliance of Motzart, I can see that Bebop has its merits. \
The story and the characters work very well together. It feels like an anime version of Firefly (which personally I'd also right at about a 7). \
The thing is that, it wasn't really thrilling to me. The lack of a real long term\
          \
        plot didn't really invest me in the characters. The characters felt deep and well-developed, and each episode individually wasn't bad, but the thing about episodic anime to me is that they can't really reach a climax. Even though Bebop's end climax was solid, it is different than watching characters change and struggle on a journey to reach the approaching peak. Bebop was sort of everyday living in this new world, then story resolution at the end kind of. \
I enjoyed it. It was solid storytelling, good characters. But I just can't get behind the universal praise Bebop receives. It's good, but no masterpiece.  \

    When I read that Cowboy Bebop is an example of \"style over substance\" show, I am pretty confused. I enjoyed the show mainly for the depth of their characters, which seemed to me to be very adult and mature in an anime universe full of one-dimensional teenagers. Still Cowboy Bebop doesn't take itself too seriously and plays around with the unsolved problems, paranoias and insecurities of adult live a lot. The histories of the main characters are all well depicted and leave signs in their contemporary lives that can't be completely ignored. The past traumas and life long struggles are shown in detail and evoke\
          \
        a great focus on human's complexity.\
The atmosphere, the tone, the mood of Cowboy Bebop is incredible. Taking elements from exploration sci-fi, western, and noir it creates a stunningly dark and slightly melancholic show perfectly in sync with the jazz pieces of the soundtrack. I feel a great sense of taste in everything while watching Cowboy Bebop. This while still having a great sense of humor which makes the show so enjoyable and not only focus on heavy psychological themes. I think the blending of the different genres and elements of western and japanese culture is perfectly balanced, thus creating something new which hasn't been seen before. The show was promoted by the producers by the motto \"a new genre unto itself\". It is naturally an exaggeration, but it does contain an element of truth. Instead of focusing totally on japanese drawn elements this show goes far beyond and creates an opera magnum which even Film as a medium has difficulties to achieve, being restricted in rules of the genres. Few directors have been able to transcend these limits and I believe Cowboy Bebop is considered a classic also for its ability to mix different elements coherently and beautifully. \
But honestly I believe this is not enough to create a masterpiece. The CULT of this show is delivered by interesting combination of before contradictory or too-different elements while thematizing universal problems such as existentialism, loneliness, ethics. Friendship and relationship to other people is depicted in such great detail you surely will find something to see yourself into. \
Long story short, Cowboy Bebop is not only style over substance. Thematic elements are incredibly deep and mature thus making it an unique experience. A classic. \

First of all this Cowboy Bebop is like several anime in the past like Pokemon and Voltes V which makes the debut of the new character or new plot elements to introduce in every episode.\
Cowoby Bebop does the same but makes something different out of it. You can call it Sessions.\
In this sessions the viewers will watch how several aspects of life, or futuristic aspects implemented in the show. \

        effects of the books that you may have read or heard about the wild west. Both the art, sound, character resonates with the story as no single narrator is to explain what is happening or what is going to happen to our characters.\
This makes Cowboy Bebop a classic with just PURE animation which nobody will not expect what will happen and makes you join the ride in which delves into the deeper themes of the show such as loneliness, future corruption of the environment, and space travelling.\
You JUST WATCH and SEE what happens in this show. That's the perfect way to enjoy it. You may need to go back and see it again if you need. ",

    These are just my vague thoughts about the show, not particularly organized or backed up with specific details from the show itself.  Probably not the best way to write a review, but I am basically just here to praise the show and state what I liked :]\
Amazing series.  Despite the fact it's episodic, you can see a connected story line through the characters and the way they and their relationships develop. \
I truly loved every character on the Bebop-- they all filled different roles without seeming forced.  They all had pasts that affected them even if we don't ever fully learn what\
          \
        their past is.  Character relationships and growth are what I look for in a series, and this one nailed it.  Also, this series has Edward!  Can anybody NOT love her?  I don't think so.\
Cowboy Bebop had a really nice mix of humor, seriousness, darkness, and suspense.  The jokes and the banter between the characters always felt genuine and made me smile.  The show really knew how to have silly moments while still remaining mature.\
I am not a big fan of tons of action and gun fights or space-themed things.  But this series made me like it.  It made it believable--  the story's universe was built so well that everything felt real while watching it.\
The show can be appreciated for the individual episodes as well as the overall themes, the biggest of which is whether or not your past makes you who you are.  An over-done theme, perhaps, but Bebop's take on it was really well done because you could see it from so many points of view.\
I'm not one to normally notice soundtracks because I am so focused on the story and the visuals, but Cowboy Bebop's soundtrack definitely stuck out to me.  I loved it.  The music always helped improve the scenes and the mood and was never a distraction.\
The art is unique and beautiful in its own way, especially from being nearly 15 years old now.\
In the end, I would recommend this series to anyone and everyone.  It started off slow for me but when I took the time and patience to appreciate it, I couldn't turn it off.  I definitely think there's a lot of rewatch value in the series as well, and I can't wait to show it to more people.\

    Cowboy Bebop is by far my favorite anime. Its got a great story that keeps the viewer entertained, laughing, and at some parts on the verge of tears that said I would like to say that I love the jazzy kinda dark feel of the overall anime and think that it was done very well. On the other hand I feel like it was pretty short... which isn't necessarily a bad thing because they didn't milk it for every dime like some newer anime but It leaves the viewer yearning for more.\

The episodic structure gradually reveals more and more about the characters while bouncing between tones and still being able to be taken as seriously or silly as it wants. With a plot that isn't exceptionally complicated, the pacing and delivery manages to make it exceptionally compelling. \

This series blew so many standard prejudices I had against anime out of the water. Here is an anime, where less is more. Less talking, less byzantine plots, less tacked-on elements, just tons of atmosphere and personality. Truly the bearer of the cup of which to baptize neophyte western Otaku, Cowboy Bebop is a series I cherish to revisit alone and with friends, and plan to do so for many years to come. \
Now I just have to wait for one of those $300+ blue-ray collections to fall into my lap and get Steve Blum to sign it...\

Cowboy Bebop is most likely one of the most famous anime out there. And it is, for very good reasons. It's a classic, and one of the first anime with a good English dub. The anime takes place in the future, following the adventures of Spike and Jet, bounty hunters (or cowboys) looking for cash. As they go about their adventures, they pick up a lady (Faye Valentine), a dog (Ein), and a boy (who's really a girl named Ed). Many things happen to them, and you eventually learn more about Spike and his interesting background.\
Story - 9/10\
While having what is IMO\
          \
        the best ending possible in any anime, it has too many filler episodes that don't have anything to do with the actual plot. This would be fine, if they actual episodes were very good, but some of them have barely anything to do with hunting down criminals, such as the one where they purchase some sketchy mushrooms. Otherwise the main plot line of the show is amazing, and the ending wraps it all up very nicely. The backstory of some of the characters is also what makes this show fantastic.\
Art - 10/10\
Even though it is a very old show, it still stands up there as one of the best drawn anime I've ever seen. The animation during fights is fantastic, especially for it's time and I've never seen anything like it when I first saw it on T.V. Characters are well drawn with realistic features, nothing too exaggerated like most animes nowaday.\
Sound - 10/10\
Oh boy, where do I even start. This show has what I want to say the best soundtrack of any anime I've ever seen in my entire life. Maybe it's my bias because it's one of the first anime I've ever seen, but The Seatbelts did an amazing job and the ending theme song (The Real Folk Blues) is one of my favorite songs of all time. I constantly hum it almost all the time in fact, and some of my colleagues have even been interested to know here it is from.\
And the English dub is one of the first best ones out there. I really felt the emotions in this dub unlike most other dubs which are just bland. However, this one definitely stands out in terms of english dub quality. \
Character - 9/10\
While the show did an amazing job developing Spike's and Jet's characters, I felt that Vicious and the others could've been done a little better. I still felt like I wanted to know more about them, but sadly the show didn't deliver on that aspect. However, for sure, they did an amazing job for what they did develop.\
Enjoyment - 10/10\
I love this anime. It's another of the ones that I grew up with, and it still sticks with me even today. It was the show that really stood out to me, and probably the one that got me into watching even more anime. Even after re-watching it recently, I still felt compelled to watch it again because that's how I much I enjoyed it. The fight scenes were splendid, the ending stunning, soundtrack fantastic, there was almost no downsides, and for the ones that it has, it makes up for two fold.\

    This short review reflects my honest opinion about this show, I don't intend to spark a flame war with it and I'm writing simply my sincere thoughts about this series.\
Cowboy Bebop is an anime that has been long since praised and is regarded as a cornerstone of Japanese animation, unfortunately, the show didn't struck me as impressive in spite of having watched it more than twice over the years. \
Story: 3\
The story is set in the year 2071 and revolves around bounty hunters, specifically Spike Spiegel and his \"partner\", Jet Black, who make a living by chasing criminals of the solar system, later on, the\
          \
        crew grows larger thanks to the voluptuous Faye Valentine and the skilled hacker Edward.\
The plot doesn't show any sign of plot progress until the fifth episode, where Spike's former friend and nemesis, Vicious is introduced, however, the plot of the various episodes fluctuates between linear bounty hunting and secondary or rather silly episodes that barely bear any significant change to the story, this is exactly what disappointed me the most, in fact, the show could be summed up in three or more episodes, perhaps I'm being hyperbolic here, but twelve episodes could have worked just as well. Frankly, episodes like \"Mushroom Samba\" bore me to death no matter how many times I rewatched the show, the fact is that Cowboy Bebop is full of these kind of episodes, hence forcing myself to watch it took me several efforts, as it goes without saying that it wasn't easy.\
Art: 7\
The animation doesn't belong in the trash, but neither is anything stunning from my point of view, although it makes the show enjoyable, there's not much to say about it.\
Sound: 8\
Music is one of the strongest points of the series, I always appreciate Yoko Kanno's works and the songs she composed for this show are no exception, almost every song in the show is worthy of being called memorable, as you'll probably wish to listen to the soundtrack at least once in your life.\
Character: 5\
It's unfortunate the characters don't match my taste at all, I guess I just can't relate to any of them or found them utterly generic, I like Spike, he's a cool and skilled guy and everything, but it doesn't get deeper than that, even after his backstory was explained along with Jet Black's and Faye's, it didn't impress me in the slightest, the characters are still cliched to the core from the beginning to the end of the anime, thus I can't help but say that I disliked them.\
Enjoyment: 6\
I always believed that if might have watched the show back when it came out, I would've enjoyed it much more. In my opinion, Cowboy Bebop has aged and nowadays it can't be regarded as a masterpiece as back then. \
I prefer shows like Darker than Black or Dimension W over it, while the two aren't as praised as much as Bebop, they don't feel nearly as generic as it. I enjoyed the ending which took a very unique turn for the better, but all I can say about Cowboy Bebop is that it's an okay show, and doesn't deserve the praise it gets.\
Overall: 5\
From my previous experiences, I have a hunch that I'm going to anger the fandom. be labelled as a troll or a person with considerably \"shit taste\" one way or the other, but it doesn't influence my thoughts about the show. I didn't enjoy Cowboy Bebop, but I could have enjoyed it if I watched it in the age it came out. This brief review only describes my subjective opinion and is in no way meant to offend somebody.\

    Não é um anime tão bom, quanto dizem ser.\
História: 5\
O anime é bem episódico, tem vários episódios inúteis na história, Spike muito raramente se fere, mesmo indo contra personagens com poderes bem OPs, ele consegue sobreviver facilmente sempre, os únicos episódios em que ele realmente fica machucado são os que o Vicious aparece, tem episódios interessantes, como o episódio de lavagem cerebral, mas são poucos pra tantos eps fillers\
Arte: 7\
Sinceramente não assisti muitos animes dos anos 90, então não sei julgar tão bem assim\
Som:8\
A trilha sonora é muito boa as vezes, porém outras parece ser colocada em momentos desnecessários ou que colocaram a música errada\
          \
        pra tocar em alguns momentos\
Personagens: 6\
Spike - não consegui compreender a motivação do personagem pra praticamente nada que ele tenha feito, as vezes ele é um bom personagem, mas normalmente é só o personagem sobrevive porque sim, mesmo em situações que seria impossível dele sobreviver, ele sobrevive com poucos machucados\
Jet: Ele acaba sendo mal utilizado no anime, ele é bem sério e parece o único personagem com bom senso no anime, seu passado é interessante, mas o anime não trabalha muito bem isso, quase sempre ele só fica na nave enquanto Spike realiza as missões, mesmo tendo sido mostrado que ele já foi policial então seria útil estar com o Spike\
Faye: a personagem com mais desenvolvimento, os conflitos que ela tem com si mesma são bem interessantes, principalmente sobre a questão de se sentir sozinha em grupo ou estar sem ninguém, o seu passado me deixou curioso, mas mostraram pouco sobre ela, mesmo ela sendo habilidosa com armas e em pilotar naves, geralmente fica na nave junto com o Jet reclamando  que precisa de dinheiro pra pagar dívidas\
Ed: Ela é uma hacker, mas é bem mal utilizada no anime, muito raramente eles precisam das suas habilidades, ela acaba ficando a maior parte do tempo apenas fazendo brincadeiras com o cachorro, ela é bem carismática, mas suas motivações não fazem sentido algum\
Vicious: Usando sua espada ele pode matar qualquer pessoa com  uma arma, aparentemente o professor do Kirito é muito habilidoso com sua espada e com sua estratégia(ou sorte, quem sabe?) a ponto de estar acorrentado e as balas direcionadas a ele acertam as correntes e assim ele consegue se soltar e matar entre 20 ou 30 personagens armados usando a sua espada, que por algum motivo desconhecido estava por ali, também não tem motivação clara, ele aparentemente é só mal mesmo\
Julia: pra que ela tá no anime? provavelmente só pra fazer umas histórias de drama com o Spike, porque ela não se mostra muito útil, muito menos interessante\
Diversão: 5\
Alguns episódios são maravilhosos enquanto outros deixam muito a desejar, os últimos episódios  foram fraquinhos, tirando o episódios 24 que foi ótimo, mas como maior parte do anime, não fez muito sentido(na questão de motivação dos personagens)\
Em geral: O anime tem seus momentos bons e personagens carismáticos como Ed e Faye, mas isso não é o suficiente pro anime ser bom\
Não costumo ser muito critico com os animes, a não ser que eles se levem a sério, como é o caso de cowboy bebop, em fim esse anime não é um bom pra maratonar e não tem muitas coisas que valem a pena assistir",

    Cowboy Bebop is considered a masterpiece of an anime nowadays, and it was one of the first anime recommended to me when I started getting into anime. I was excited to get into the series, but that excitement unfortunately did not last. About halfway through the series, I had to keep forcing myself to watch another episode just so I could finish the series (I don't like stopping in the middle of a show), but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's just start with the story.\
There is no story. This is an episodic series, which isn't a problem in its own right, but isn't something\
          \
        I'm typically into. I prefer overarching plots that tell one cohesive story. However, I have enjoyed episodic series before, so I kept watching. I quickly got bored of the repetitive plots. The villains of each episode were hardly interesting because they didn't get enough time to do anything. That really goes for all the characters except for the core 4. There is never enough time to develop anything enough to the point where I actually care. The individual stories are fine on their own, but they just felt like a drag to get through together. I'll give a 6/10 since I did enjoy a good number of them, but the ones that I didn't just felt like a chore to sit and watch through.\
I'm putting art and sound together because they are both fantastic, and it's hard to talk about one without the other. The animation is consistently fast and fluid, and the directing is amazing. The music almost always goes perfectly with each scene its in, and the OP of the whole series is one of the most catchy openings I've listened to. The dub of this series is also great, with each voice actor doing an amazing job for their respective characters. Both get a 9.\
Now onto my main complaint, the characters. The core four characters, Spike, Jet, Faye and Edward are all very well developed, and I enjoyed watching them (except for Ed, she got annoying fast). The problems come with everyone else. As I've already said, none of them get the time they need for me to actually care about them. They have to establish the characters, and then, in the same episode, wrap up their stories, and that just isn't enough time. Spike, Jet and Faye were all great and well developed characters, but they are the only ones who I cared about in the entire series, so 4/10.\
My enjoyment level for this series continued to go down with each episode. It felt like a chore to watch another episode, which is why it took me four months to finish this series. It did have some really great moments, and the action in the series was consistently very good. I can definitely see why this show got its cult status, it just wasn't for me. I'll give this another 4 for enjoyment, and overall I'd give it a 7/10. \

    Cowboy Beboop (ha) is an episodic anime with a dog. That is not a bad thing but that is essentially what is. The story is set in the future where the earth was partially destroyed and most humans live in space. It follows Spike and Jet, two cowboys (space bounty hunters) and their adventures in space.\
This is an easy set-up for an episodic show to use because much like space the possibilities of an episodic show are infinite. It adds a few more mainstay characters that we learn about and that are interesting (including a dog!). The crew of the Bebop (Jet and Spike's ship)\
          \
        are nicely miss-matched group, even Spike and Jet, but it's this clash of personalities and characters make them all the more enjoyable as a group and as individuals.\
In saying this the voice actors do a good portrail of their individual character (I watched the dub). They're many moments in the show that gave you the 'feels' as it were, so one couldn't really argue that the VA's weren't in it, at least as my memory of the show serves. Furthermore the score was well done and makes every scene better than they usually are and is one that'll definitely stick if your a jazz or slow jam person. In addition the OP is one I still enjoy to this day and really works well both as an OP and a stand alone song, the ED thought not as good makes each episode feel complete.\
The art style looks worn, though that is only due to Bebop's age and either be a plus or a minus depending on the taste of the person. Everything in the world of cowboy bebop feels and looks real to a degree and the movements are descent. The stiller moments seem to shine for me more than the more action packed scenes but that's not to say they weren't good I just like the quieter moments in cowboy bebop more.\
Lastly I'd like to say that I enjoyed Cowboy Bebop as both an idea and a show. I don't enjoy a lot of episodic shows because they get repetitive (Simpsons, Spongebob, Fairly Odd Parents) but Cowboy Bebop shuffles the focus every episode to offer a little something  for everyone. No episodes fealt the same or dealt with the same character or plot, which is to be expected of an episodic show and as such a lot of the plot comes at the end.\
In conclusion if your looking for old, fun, gritty, and episodic anime that feels different every episode then Cowboy bebop is the show your looking for.      \

    Cowboy Bebop is set in the future well intergalactic travel is normal and everyone has their own spaceship. Spike Spiegel and his partner Jet Black are two bounty hunters and owners of the spaceship Bebop. Later joined by Faye Valentine, Ed and Ein, the group fly around in space, taking on bounties to survive. Each bounty they take is more trouble than they are worth but they take them with good hearts and a good sense of humor. You learn more and more about each character as the series rolls on a grow strongly attached to each of them by the end.\
The series is very\
          \
        episodic in a way that each episode has no real relation to each other, except the double part episodes. There isn't really a story to be told aside from the group hunting bounties and Spike dealing with his past. That is the reason it took me so long to watch this series. Although I enjoyed watching the characters and their adventures, I found it rather hard to start the next episode. There wasn't exactly a draw that hooked me into watching it. That, however was my only problem with the series. Aside from that, I thought it was absolutely fantastic.\
The characters are absolutely phenomenal. Many episodes explain more about each characters past and makes you grow attached to each other them. I can't say there was a character that I disliked from this series as they were all so different and so interesting to watch. My personal favorite was Faye. I don't want to give anything away, but she has a couple rather interesting episodes that bring tears to my eyes. Each character has somewhat of a sad past, each of them having someone they loved and lost and rediscovering them in different ways. \
I watched it dubbed because I heard that the dub was amazing and many say even better. I thought it was great, no complaints at all. It's not in a setting where Japanese culture matters, I suppose. The music is jazzy and the intro will be stuck in my head for the rest of my life. I don't care too much for art from the 90's but for an anime from 1998, I thought it looked amazing. One thing I do want to point out though, was that everyone in the anime appeared human. I don't know exactly how much of space they explored or how many planets they go to, but everyone was human. It's not a complaint or anything, just pointing that out.\
Aside from the patchy story, I thought Cowboy Bebop was an amazing anime. It was really entertaining, the action is violent, the characters are lovable, the humor is rich, pretty much everything you could ask for.\
Likes:\
-All the characters were fantastic, learning about a characters backstory is something I love and Cowboy Bebop explains each of theirs incredibly well.\
-\"SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY...\" was something I loved seeing at the end of each episode, it's so small and simple yet I absolutely loved it.\
-I really wish I could fly around in space and hunt bounties across the stars\
Dislikes:\
-The ending really bothered me, not exactly the ending really, but what happens leading to the ending. If that makes sense.\

    My First Review ever so bare with me\
Well I'm not even going to sugarcoat the fact that Cowboy Bebop was a big letdown for me. I was expecting so much from this series due to everyone hyping it up. But, I was left with underdeveloped characters, beyond idiotic actions from characters, and no one listening to Jet.... EVER. Despite all of this, there were some redeeming factors to this animes such as the music, funny scenarios, and just overall enjoyment.\
Story:7\
This shows all about the realtionship of a crew consisting of Spike, Ed, Jet, Faye, and little ole' Ein. Just a couple of \"bounty hunters\" (and\
          \
        a dog) going from bounty to bounty, and how their pasts sort of catches up with them. Nothing special here really, It's whatever.\
Art:8\
I'm going to say this first off, I'm not the best judge when it comes to things such as art and animation but there were no problems with either of those in this anime. Pretty solid overall in my opinion.\
Sound:10\
This would be the entire anime's strongpoint in my opinion. The names of the episodes would be based off of genres, songs, and albums (ex: Asteroid Blues & Ballad of the Fallen Angels) and the music in each episodes sorta correlates to name of the episodes. The soundtrack mainly consists of Jazz and Blues music. These songs/insturmentals always added to the scenes and made them better than they actually were. A fight scene was turned into an AMAZING scene and a sad scene turned into a HEART-WRENCHINGLY SAD SCENE. The music was what made me keep watching this anime.\
Character:6\
Now his was the weak point of the anime for me. There were so many times where I wanted to know more about the characters like Ed or Ein, or Jet. There was literally no info given about Ed and Ein, they got no love. They were there to lighten up the series yet I know nothing about them. Jet was like the overprotective father of the group and I like that, but NO ONE AND I MEAN NO ONE EVER LISTENED TO HIM. Dang it as so annoying, like there would be CLEAR danger in their way and Jet would give some sound advice but all Faye and Spike wanted to do was die with a bang like HOLY. And Spike was EXTREMELY irrational and idiotic  to the point where it was eye aching. The reason for his innjuries 100% of the time was because he just went on his stupidity, no not instict, but stupidity. His character was cool at first but after a while he reminded me of a rebelious teenager who's overdramatic. Faye was alright, her back story was kinda sad but they explained so quickly I had to deep connection with her. Then there's Jet, not much too say really. He gets one episode of backstory for himself and done. We do get a LITTLE and when I say little i mean minuscule insight from other episodes about his past life, but again that's it.\
Enjoyment:8 \
Now even though the characters pissed me off, they did have their badass moments. Especially with his knack to use the environment to his advantage and his smooth fighting style. The funny moments with Ein and Ed were also a nice addition. Again, those moments really lightened up the show when it was getting depressing and dark. Also the conversations between people were also pretty hilarious to say the least\
Overall: 7.5\
Although I did get irritated at A LOT of moments in Cowboy Bebop it was still fairly enjoyable. The music also stepped the anime up a notch on my scale because of how good it was at enhancing the scene rather than take you away from it or kill it entirely. There no problems with art and animation either. In my opinion, this show doesn't live up to the hype in the slightest, It was underwhelming throughout the entire series in my opinion. Although, that ending was pretty sad. If you want to go watch this classic, go ahead, just don't go in with high expectations. REMEMBER NO OF THIS IS FACT, IT'S ALL MY OPINION.\
P.S. I may have been a little nit picky with this anime but it was because I actually wanted to look at all aspects of the anime while watching it instead of just blindly watching it and giving it a 10 without knowing exactly what I enjoyed/disliked.\

    If you aren't really emotionally invested into the characters early on, there is no overarching narrative to hold onto, so the only things that kept me personally watching were the beautiful and painstakingly detailed visual environments and character designs, and the outstanding soundtrack.\
And yes, I can appreciate, some of the thematic undertones, relating to personal demons explored in the later episodes of the show, if you don't fall for the characters emotionally, something I imagine is extremely subjective, it may be a little harder to watch, that is less addictive, than other shows with a little more in the way of consistent narrative progression. \

    If anyone ever asks what my favorite anime is I'll reply, \"Cowboy Bebop\" without a pause. Its the perfect blend of western and scifi with a hint of noir and any other genre they could manage to fit in there, all supported by some great music. \
Cowboy Bebop has great characters, rich stories, beautiful art, and some of the best music I've ever seen in an anime. The main plot is limited to a small portion of the 26 episodes leaving the other episodes to be largely self contained stories.In this way it is similar to other shows like Gintama that are structured primarily episodaly.\
          \
        This allows the creators to experiment on every episode with a variety of genres and themes while exploring and developing characters and giving you glimpses of a beautiful and clearly very vast world. \
The episodal nature of the anime while being one of its greatest strengths is also its greatest weakness and a small number of episodes are definite misses especially when it comes to the quality of the rest of the anime. However, as these are all stand alone episodes these shortfalls don't detract from the rest of the anime and if you wanted to could easily be skipped.\

Cowboy Bebop has been praised by fans and critics as the greatest anime of all-time, it set a benchmark in the 90s for animation quality, has some of the best storytelling ever written and is one of the most influential anime ever. \
The show is episodic by nature but has enough backstory in each character to give an over arching view. Focusing in on the Bebop crew and their not so successful bounty hunting adventures Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed make up four of the greatest anime characters ever. They each bring something amazing to the show. Ed the super hacker adds a light hearted\
          \
        element to the show that never seems to slow down or hurt the show in any way like so many other comic relief characters do, Jet the ex cop turned bounty hunter is kind of the father figure in the group, Faye the lovable gambling addict from the past who acts as a counter part to Spike and Spike... oh Spike, probably the coolest anime character ever, how do you not love this guy? he fights like Bruce Lee, has an amazing shot, has a dope backstory, is a total badass and has said some of the most icon quotes in anime history.\
The animation is some of the best I've ever seen, backgrounds are detailed, the characters designs are all very unique, the fights flow like water and oh ya this is all hand drawn animation! no cheep tricks or cutting corners every frame of this show is absolutely flawless. The soundtrack on it's own is nice but coupled with the show is like the best anime soundtrack ever.it reminds me of Martin Scorsese's 1976 masterpiece Taxi Driver in how the music seems to fuse so well with the visuals to give the viewer a one of a kind experience. \
Overall Cowboy Bebop is one of the greatest shows ever (anime or not), it has aged like scotch and is a must see for any and every anime fan. Until next time, see you space cowboy\

    Cowboy Bebop is a triumph of budget; a paper-thin anime with dynamic, fluid animation, a lovingly crafted eclectic soundtrack, and stylistic nuances for miles (one episode even effectively parodies blaxploitation). I don't mean that in an entirely derogatory way; it's really no surprise this is one of the major things that got people into Japanese animation, because it's an extremely fully realized show, so fully realized in fact that it's easy to overlook broad, undeveloped characters and a fanservice-vehicle female character who's dressed like a space hooker most of the time. There's not much to it, and yet there is.\

    I first watched Cowboy Bebop: Knocking on Heaven's door a couple years back and felt genuinely engaged throughout the movie and regretted that it had to end. I had absolutely no idea there was a fantastic piece of artwork in the form of an anime series behind this titular film. Ironically, as I watched Cowboy Bebop I found myself humbly involved with the series to the point that I would pause between episodes to really soak in this fantastic show. It is a genre in itself and never insists that it is. It is a fantastic chronicle of people experiencing an extraordinary lifestyle, but also\
          \
        dealing with the normal challenges life brings. This series was dedicated to those special moments in your life when you say to yourself in the back of your mind \"this is worth it, this is me embracing the moment\". Of course these feelings are fleeting, which only makes them more cherishable, much like the brief run of this spectacular series.\
The series takes place in the future. Earth has been plagued by freak technological accident and much of the population has expanded to the various planets in the solar system. Each planet is like a whole other world, which are slightly expanded upon during each adventure for the crew of the bebop. The bebop first has only Jet and Spike, bounty hunters looking for work only so they can fill their stomachs. Jet comes from a policing background, which has given him a reputation as the \"black dog\" who never releases his bite on a case. This gives him a sense of authority and father like actualities throughout the series. His partner, and the main character, Spike, comes from a mysterious past with ties to a crime syndicate known as the Red Dragon. He has since pulled out of the syndicate after realizing that it didn't make him \"alive\". He plans to be with his true love Julia, but circumstances arise between him and his long time rival Vicious, the only recurring antagonist of the series. As such, Jet and Spike get along well with one another since they are both trying to look ahead instead of behind. As they continue their journeys they meet various people during missions who seem to encapsulate various life experiences in their characters. Love, anguish, betrayal, obsession, loneliness, if only to name a few. Its as if the bounty is only the outer coating to much more involved lessons which are shown through the most subtle of gestures, much like in the real world, where it is hard to really know if something has impacted you until its over Jet and Spike soon meet Faye and Ed, two girls with mysterious pasts. Faye gradually learns of her past albeit at the end of the series at which point she lets down her guard to realize her true home is on the bebop. Ed presents herself as a zainy hacking genius, but she also has ties with her estranged father, which has caused her to wander frequently. WIth the ship's local canine Ein, Ed often makes ideas more clear to viewers through her childlike comedy by shouting them out is crazy ways. All four of these crew members embark on a series of encounters with various bounties. The story is moving on all levels, and remained the least bit contrived throughout, The great thing was the combination of most genres. There was not set plot or motif, which made all of the action and humor more engaging. The viewer is made to care about each exploit because they don't know what to expect on a structural level, but are still able to take tide and true knowledge with them after each stint.\
The animation for the series was clearly defined and realistic, with each character being drawn in a way to reveal their personalities on a physical level. Jet is older, more experienced, with receding hair and armor to match. Spike is spontaneous and subtle at the same time, with wild hair and an ironically neat suit to match it. Faye is sexually involving but tough as nails. She is stubborn and selfish, enhanced by her look at me wardrobe. Ed's clothing is enhanced by her unpredictability. You don't really know what to think of her clothing since their it is so basic and childlike. This simplicity allows Ed to be more Astonishing. This pattern of art is seen throughout the character spectrum. All of the worlds are their own and match their tones. Just awesome.\
The music for the series was absolutely insane. Each episode is known as a session and essentially the series is rooted from music itself. Every encounter has a soundtrack that enhances the feelings being portrayed in the episode. If its metal, its probably a tense situation, if its jazz, past regrets are being felt, if its classical, love is expressed. This coupled with the beautiful art only makes the story more impacting on a whole other level!??! The whole spectrum of this anime is seen with these combinations of sound and art! Also, each episode title refers to the type of music played throughout.\
The characters in this series are the enjoyment factor. The crew of the bebop is so subtle with their affections that it seems like they've been a family for years. At times they don't even care about what the other is doing because it seems vindictive but the subtext is that they do care...so much so that they don't because they know thats just who the other person is. Its a whole other realm of trust that is so true in real life. Like I said earlier, if you couple the family crew of the bebop with influential characters on different worlds with their own messages, it makes it seem like the family learns something together, which makes the viewer learn something from four different angles. All of their actin and humor towards their bounty targets and eachother is hilarious and touching, and just pure entertainment.\
I will never regret the time I spent watching, learning, and ultimately living from Cowboy Bebop.\

    There is not much that can be said about Cowboy Bebop that has not already been said. It is considered a classic among classics, and one of the best anime ever created. It's story, art, soundtrack, and characters are truly beloved by many. I have yet to find a person who does not agree with them.\
Story:\
Cowboy Bebop does not have an inherent, flowing story like many other anime. It is mostly episodic, yet still manages to be story (and character, but we'll get to that later) driven. The story revolves around a group of bounty hunters in a dystopian future, searching for bounties to make\
          \
        a living. I will admit that you may become disengaged toward the middle of the series, but it quickly recovers with several exceptional episodes later on. The premise seems uneventful, and when you think about it, not much really happens in the way of story progression. And yet, the plot-lines are captivating, well created and ultimately satisfying. For this, I give Cowboy Bebop an 8 for story.\
Art:\
The art is, to be very honest, nothing unique. It has the same 90's anime look that you've seen, but that is not to say it isn't beautiful in it's own right. The design is solid, with nothing looking out of place. While the art style is not original, it has the best execution of that style I've seen. The animation is consistently fluid and impressive, especially during the fighting scenes, in which Spike's movements look amazing. The show just looks good. I give Cowboy Bebop an 8 for art.\
Sound:\
The soundtrack of Cowboy Bebop is often hailed as one of the best, with jazzy tunes mixed in with slow classical compositions. If there is one thing you cannot deny, it is that it's soundtrack is refreshingly varied. However, at points I found that the style of music failed to accentuate the moment at hand. While I found this distracting, the overall song choice is exceptional. As nobody can deny, Cowboy Bebop's soundtrack is among the best in not only any anime, but many shows in general. They would agree that the soundtrack deserves a 9.\
Character:\
If there is one thing exceptional about Cowboy Bebop, it is it's three dimensional characters. I am conflicted, even, to call them characters, because they are just so real. Their drives, their conflicts and their pasts are executed seamlessly and exceptionally. Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed are not a means to an end, they are not plot mechanics, they are an insight into actual personalities and how they would react in the dystopian future of the world of Cowboy Bebop. I can imagine, in some parallel dimensional, that these people could exist. They are not caricatures, they are convincingly real characters that give Cowboy Bebop a 9 in the character department.\
Enjoyment:\
If there is anything Cowboy Bebop does right, it is that it makes you feel invested and immersed in the world. The culmination of all the previous aspects is a show that is quite simply fun to watch. In the enjoyment department, that is a great thing. I give Cowboy Bebop a 9 for enjoyment.\
Overall:\
Cowboy Bebop is a classic, there is no denying. The noir genre has had many great contributions, and I believe Cowboy Bebop is of the best of those. I would have given it a 10 had it not been for some minor hiccups. I don't really think anything deserves a ten that I've personally encountered. But I degress, as this is definitely one of the most influential and impressive anime ever created.\
I give Cowboy Bebop a 9 out of 10!\

    \"Once upon a time, in New York City in 1941... at this club open to all comers to play, night after night, at a club named \"Minston's Play House\" in Harlem, they play jazz sessions competing with each other. Young jazz men with a new sense are gathering. At last they created a new genre itself. They are sick and tired of the conventional fixed style jazz. They're eager to play jazz more freely as they wish then... in 2071 in the universe... The bounty hunters, who are gathering in the spaceship \"BEBOP\", will play freely without fear of risky things. They must create new\
          \
        dreams and films by breaking traditional styles. The work, which becomes a new genre itself, will be called... COWBOY BEBOP\"\
That quote is probably a valid review of the first 24 episodes of the anime.\
Cowboy Bebop is a set of parables, picking up and dropping off at whatever random points the main characters happen to stumble upon them, and in some cases, ending them. The beauty in Cowboy Bebop stands in the one story that we kinda sorta actually get to see. The story of Spike. I would argue that just about every other story told would be just as interesting as his if only we had the time to more fully develop the characters and plot. But Spike's story, that one we do get the pleasure of experiencing. The weight that we get to carry. \
This anime is about a very specific aspect of the human experience: empathy. It forces us to empathize with a roster of characters and watch them struggle. Not at all to the extent that as something like Texhnolyze, but enough to make you really ponder the reality of what you've just seen. Every character lives and dies by their own decisions, and you're tasked with burdening those decisions; to understand and accept them. \
Other than that, it's simply an astonishingly good looking, good sounding, mostly episodic, perfect anime with tons of style points. \

It has a good premise, an uncommon one so it makes it more interesting. The story when it has fun, it really has fun, and when it gets sad, it really gets sad. I was close to shedding a tear towards the end but I was overcame by a feeling of hollowness, which is much worse. I got closure from the end, but I don't think I'm satisfied with it. I'm really gonna miss this one. \

Hands down one of the best openings I've ever seen. It's not textbook, it's creative, it presents characters in an unorthodox way,\
          \
        it transitions in an unorthodox way, it's an opening I wouldn't mind watching through over and over again. Animation is top quality, and the fights are just a joy to watch. Same goes for all of Watanabe's works. As for character design, I absolutely love it, I've never seen such different characters. Every character is distinct from one another, and it makes the anime so much more memorable. Not to mention, the animation. The animation is superb, especially for an anime of its time. The fight scenes are so clear and smooth, so entertaining. \

\"I think it's to time blow this thing, get everything stuffed together. OK, 3-2-1, let's jam!\" I love the soundtrack for this entire anime, it has the right songs to fit in the right moods and it helps to evoke so much more. \

Spike is an interesting one. That being said, all of the characters are interesting. Including the supporting characters that only last an episode or two. They have all have an interesting background and personality that makes them so much more memorable. \
Enjoyment: 10\
I LOVE THIS ANIME. I love Samurai Champloo as well. I've always been a fan of Watanbe's work. He has a story that just hits it on the nail that keeps you wanting for more yet helps you understand that there can't be more. Perhaps if I were to critique anything about the anime, is that it's only so long. It feels like it can go on forever, but at the same time I feel as if 26 episodes is enough. Nevertheless, it's an anime I can say blows out any anime of its genre out of the water, including the newest ones.\
Overall: 10\
ABSOLUTE must watch. I don't care if you don't watch action anime. Cowboy Bebop is an ABSOLUTE must watch. It's undeniably good, and a definite classic. \

    I thought I'd try writing a review for once, and also for an anime I have sort of complicated feelings on so here goes! \
I enjoyed Cowboy Bebop a lot more than most anime, so it was by no means unenjoyable. However, I never liked it as much as a lot of people and also by comparison to a lot of really popular anime so I'm going to try and pinpoint the reasons for that.. it's still a very entertaining anime though make no mistake!\
Basically, it just comes down to not really being a big fan of the characters at times.. Spike is kind of\
          \
        a bit easygoing for me, Jet is kind of a bit stiff, Ed is kind of too random, Faye is sort of greedy. \
Well ok, Faye is pretty cool, it's true, then Ed..  but overall I the biggest thing was that Cowboy Bebop kind of starts off insanely slow and is very, very cautious \
Now, that is, on the one hand, appealing! Certainly Cowboy Bebop is one of the more engaging anime for that reason, but when things often had a kind of filler-y approach for the most part. \
The story moves around a lot, basically Spike and Jet are perpetually out of $ because they keep almost failing to get so-and-so or such-and-such, as a consequence the anime is more about the banter and character experiences as much as the big mega moments involving old hatreds or new optimism or whatever it is. \
Like, ok, it's a unique blend of different worlds, it's fantastical, it's realistic, it's sensible and boisterious, it's a strong personality, it's Cowboy Bebop, but, the best? Hmm I mean consider there are lots of really engaging anime out there. \
Ok, lets make a deal, and put Cowboy Bebop up there, but the movie much more resonant in many ways, it incoporated the cool things about the anime and kind of squished it into something that didn't feel like it dragged as much. \
Overall, I can't say I hated Cowboy Bebop, it just felt like the experiences of emotional high were few and far and in between, thus, an 8 (ah screw it, I'll just give it a 9)\

    Cowboy Bebop - before you decide to watch this anime get ready to go on a serious feels trip. It may seem harmless, but it's a lot more than just a comedy - based anime. This genius work of art, coming from Shinichirō Watanabe (you may know him from directing Samurai Champloo, Zankyou no Terror or Sakamichi no Apollon, he produced all of those aswell), will take you to the realms like you've never experienced before.\
Eventho the anime started airing throughout 1998, and finished in about April 1999, it had pretty decent animation I've to say. But I'd still rate it a 6, just because\
          \
        most of the scenes are portrayed as moving pictures, and don't any actual animation in them. But I guess that's reasonable because it was 1998 and all that shit.\
Neverthless, this anime posses one thing that I rarely see in the anime made throughtout this millenium - the actual goddamn story. The story itself isn't a fascinating one I'd say, but I've enjoyed watching the fillers that cover the background story of every single character itself. The reasons why they were scarred, the reasons why they did the stuff they did, and so on. I found it so much more amusing watching the anime that was made at the end of the previous millenium that these they make nowadays tho. The animation may be poor, but you can see the actual story somewhere.\
So, without further a do, as you can read in the synopsis, the whole story revolves around Spike and Jet, two bounty hunters who chase intergalactic criminals and do badass stuff all the way down to it. The anime was quite well paced I'd say, not too fast, and not too slow I guess. And yeah, the ending was perfect I'd say, just to my liking. Of course I won't spoil the ending, just saying it tho.\
Oh, and so my favourite part - the OST's of this anime are really, really amazing. That opening song was easily the best one I've ever heard. Every single time I watched the opening, which I really rarely do, I mostly skip them all. The music matches the scenes so well, you just can't hate it. I mean, who doesn't love a chilly OST or an opening song? Well, that's about it, the only real thing I can complain about here is the animation, so I rated it a 6, but the whole anime overall - I rate it a pure 10. \

    this show is a touchy subject I find with a lot of anime fans. Me myself, I had always heard of this show growing up and thought it was boring as balls. Or I was too busy watching DraginBallZ. But now that I've matured, and had the chance to buy this show and watch it to it's fullest potential, I gotta say, it was one great investment. let's jam!\
Story:\
Well the story of Cowboy Bebop is pretty simple, a group of bounty hunters who want to do nothing more than make enough money to at least not starve to death in the galaxy. But the other\
          \
        half of the story is how each character  has a past that will come back to haunt them. See the story to Bebop is both awesome and hard to get people to watch. As I had watched GRarkada's review on it before watching it, he said the first four episodes would be a snooze compared to what the other episodes had in store for you. so if you want my recommendation it will be the same as his because it worked for me. watch episodes 5, then 6, then go back and watch episodes 1-4 and watch 7 all the way to the end. Trust me, it works.\
Animation:\
You gotta remember this show came out in 1998 and ended in 1999 people, you aren't getting any PA works animation here. But if you look at other anime from the time the show is pretty high standard for the time. The other good note for the animation, one being my personal thing that I like, is that the animation made the character's and their look feel bluesy. Another good note worth mentioning is that the action scenes are very smooth in execution, which is great cause that is one the best parts of the show is the action. \
Sound:\
The sound in Cowboy Bebop is easily where this show shines the most, not even up for debate. This is the show that has one of THE best English dubs of all time, and if it's not the best, then it damn well was the first before this dub, dubs were SHIT! Steve blum as Spike Spiegel sealed the along with Bo billanger as Jet, and the voices of faye and ed were amazing as well (forgot the actress's names.) However as good as the dub is, the music in Bebop is just as perfect as well. the show has an amazing selection of music from jazz, to blues, being the genres the show has the focal point on, to even some metal tracks, nice acoustics, you name it, it's got it. Fun fact, the names of the episodes are musically inclined as well, such as bohemian rhapsody and heavy metal queen. absolutely amazing soundtrack.\
Characters:\
All the characters in Bebop are very well flushed out, and all very entertaining in their own way. The main character Spike, is as badass and to the tee of the rule of cool as it comes, Faye, the chick that may not be no martial arts master, but can hold her own with her sassy attitude and sensual trickery, Jet, who is more the wiseman of the group and Ed, the hyperactive comic relief which the show needed to add some color to the Bebop crew's rather down tone sometimes. And it works perfectly because they each bounce off each other so well the chemistry is great.\
My personal enjoyment:\
In all honesty, as much as I praise the shit out of this show, it's not for everybody. The show is episodic so I can see why people looking for a deep plot wouldn't like it. But if your looking for something simple/epic and fun as hell characters, there is few better to watch than Bebop. overall, it's a classic, and should be viewed as such.\

    Cowboy Bebop - I believe is one of the most loved animes out there, even today.\
There are great reviews here for this anime - reviews that'll make you want to watch or drop it.\
So why is another one needed? - Well, some people just like to have insight over things they have an interest for.\
Bear in mind that this is a review from someone who completed the Anime in 2017. Maybe it'd have been different if I watched it back in 1998, but I didn't, so I have to judge it from what I felt at the time of watching it. Also, please don't hate\
          \
        me for not loving Cowboy Bebop - I don't mean to bash it, I'm just sharing my experiences.\
I didn't go in expecting a lot from Cowboy Bebop but I just knew I had to watch it because it's such a classic. I think that was a good thing.\
Storywise... there's not much going on. It's definitely the weakest point overall. I mean, there's a story to be told - but it's sort of scattered all over the place when it didn''t need to be. It's a simple story told in erratic ways. Simply put, the narrative is flawed. You'll get bits of information here and there, which then will be forgotten for some time for no apparent reason. I'm fine with episodic anime, I actually like them, but Cowboy Bebop did not work for me - the switching between telling you one piece of the story and then moving to a random episode where absolutely nothing important or interesting happens is really off-putting to me. At least they should have used these to advance the plot in better ways instead of just coming up with another \"Saturday Morning Villain\" (which again, has no connection whatsoever to the rest of the anime - it'd have been fine if it was done once or twice, but more than that really pushed my patience).\
In terms of Audio/Visual presentation, the studio did a fantastic job, and I say this even though I did not like most of the soundtracks and style of music used - but I can recognize that they put a lot of effort into it and that it fits the theme they had going on. There seems to be, as many have pointed out, a lot of Western influence here. Even the characters seem to be made in a way that appeals \"more than usual\" to western audiences.\
There's great variety between each character, and I have to applaud the art team because the anime holds up well even nowadays, in fact, I'd say it looks better than most animes out there today precisely because it has it's own very defined and original style.\
Sadly, most of these characters weren't explored well - this hurts the show a lot because it makes caring for them harder than it should be.\
The thing is though, even though I could write a lot more to complain, Cowboy Bebop still managed to entertain me with its action scenes - which is why I give it a 7 overall. I had way more fun than with Black Lagoon for example (which I found dull and boring). There's just something likeable about Spike and the way he handles his problems which is very... entertaining.\
As someone else said in another review, what you'll get here is ''style over substance\".\

    I try to stay away from a score of 10 as it sounds untrue as nothing is perfect but I must say after watching this.. though this review comes late it has been the closest show to making it. The story was very good at keeping you interested it did lack a backbone and you never tricked yourself into believing that the characters were in much trouble, up until the end that is and boy do I love that ending. the art is absolutely gorgeous I believe it was one of the last animes to be drawn by hand and it shows. the music I\

        quite enjoy but if you don't like blues you might not enjoy it as much. the characters are somewhat average though I'm told it was quite new for its time and even though it is somewhat normal now they play their characters well. Overall I wholeheartedly enjoyed it and I would recommend watching it and in the dub as its one of the best dubs out there in my opinion.\

    The year is 2071. Humanity has long since expanded into space, with civilization taking hold in various ways on a large selection of the different rocky bodies throughout the solar system. Luckily, we were already in the middle of this process when a hyperspace gateway near the Earth exploded, leaving the planet in ruins and virtually uninhabitable. It’s been fifty years since then, but we can still feel the effect of the disaster. Our colonies range from big, busy cities to smaller, less affluent townships that you’d swear were taken right out of the old west. Interspace travel means nothing to most folk, who were\
          \
        born and raised and eventually expired on the same planet, hell, maybe even in the same town. Sure, those who chose the life of a transportation or delivery pilot may see a couple of different planets, and those rich enough to travel may have seen a few different sunrises, but if you’ve been everywhere, seen every shade of civilization, felt the grass and dirt of multiple planets beneath your feet, then you’re either a criminal... Or a Bounty Hunter.\
Yeah, it turns out that with so much ground to cover, the central government can’t be bothered to uphold the law in every society, nor to keep up with wanted criminals who could be hiding out on any number of worlds. Thus, we’ve seen the rise of the registered bounty hunters, people who’ve taken on the job of tracking down and apprehending those with a high enough price on their head and delivering them to the authorities. It’s a job that offers you freedom, excitement, and the right to be your own boss, provided you’re successful enough to keep food on the table. Basically, it’s a job that appeals to those who would otherwise probably be outlaws themselves, real rough-and-tumble characters who just don’t fit into normal society. This description couldn’t possibly fit anybody more than the crew of the Bebop, a moderately sized vessel owned by a retired detective, that houses an ex-gangster, a femme fatale with a gambling problem, a psychotic child prodigy, oh, and also a dog. They may sound like a crew of rejects and shady characters, but with these cowboys on your tail, you might not even live to see prison.\
Cowboy Bebop was produced by Studio Sunrise, a company that’s been churning out anime since the seventies, and is still just as prolific today, with some of their more recent hits including Code Geass, Love Live, and the entire Gundam catalog. Bebop was one of their last projects in the nineties, but there are a few other notable benchmarks it holds. First of all, Bebop was the last project that several people working for the company would make before they parted ways, and formed their own studio, the incredibly popular and well-respected Studio Bones. I’m assuming this split was an amicable one, because they were able to collaborate with their former parent company to make the Cowboy Bebop movie only a few years later. So yeah, the legendary production company that began in the 2ooo’s and is able to brag about producing both versions of Fullmetal Alchemist, Soul Eater, Ouran High School host Club and Space Dandy, to name a few, and it’s greatest precursor was Bebop.\
And the other benchmark? Cowboy Bebop was one of the final anime to be animated using hand-drawn cells rather than digital drawings. You would think this would be an indication of lacking visual quality, as the last efforts of one style before another takes over are usually somewhat pathetic... Just look at disco... But Cowboy Bebop is a glaring exception to that rule. Not only is it one of the best looking anime of the nineties, it holds up today as one of the best looking anime of all time. Yeah, when compared to offerings from today’s market, Bebop definitely has a very retro feel to it, but since the series was originally designed to be retro, that just makes the aesthetic all the more timeless. The animation is unbelievably fluid, with action scenes that never have to break frames to look impressive, and space battles epic enough to warrant a comparison to early Star Wars. Even when the action does slow down, and the camera does linger on a shot, the artwork is beautiful enough... And the cinematography is smart enough... That you’ll never complain about what you’re seeing.\
The character designs are diverse, but human enough that everyone you meet... Aside from perhaps Ed and a certain balloon-like villain... Looks like someone that could easily be translated into real life, at least in terms of anatomy and facial structure. Their outfits are set to color palettes and styles that match their personalities while still remaining pleasing to the eye, and the backgrounds throughout are highly detailed. Episodes that take place in a western background are bright and welcoming, despite being broken down, dirty and weathered with time. Episodes with a more noir feel will take place in a tighter and darker environment, more shadowy and dangerous. Outer space is portrayed as expansive and empty, even when it’s filled with stars and debris. The use of color saturation and shading easily sells the tone and genre of any episode, and if you’re watching the newly released blu-ray version of the series, all of the show’s beauty is cranked up to eleven. And it’s not just the art style that enhances Bebop’s visual quality.\
I feel like the best way to describe the music in this series would be to inform you that the musical composer of the series, Yoko Kanno, was also the inspiration for the personality and mannerisms of the character Ed, so try to imagine the kind of musical score that a film noir space western would have if it came from a wild, free-spirited genius with no respect for convention. Translation, it’s spectacular, possibly one of the best anime scores in the history of the medium. The score leans heavily towards jazz and the blues, and while the instruments that Kanno’s band The Seatbelts has available are diverse, there’s an intense focus on trombones and saxophones, which in my opinion aren’t used enough in anime. It fits perfectly in Cowboy Bebop, as the aesthetic demands a funky sounding soundtrack, but the stuff they didn’t do themselves... And thus the music that breaks from the series style... Are just as good. There’s a Steve Conte song called “Call me call me,” in one of the last episodes, that actually makes me cry, both in and out of context.\
The most famous musical number from this series is probably Green Bird by Gabriela Robin, which is actually a false name for Yoko Kanno herself, which beautifully accompanies what little glimpses at Spike’s backstory we’re actually allowed to see. A certain western sounding tune named Go Go Cactus Man is also noteworthy for heralding the appearance of a literal cowboy, and amusingly enough, Spike himself reacts to this tune when it’s played. Outside of the score, the sound design is also smartly used, with smaller unreleased musical pieces hyping up the tension and suspense of episodes like Toys in the Attic, but all of that pales in comparison to the show’s opening and ending themes. Both are iconic in their own right, with Tank serving as the funky, undeniably catchy pump-up for some space-faring adventures, and the closing theme The Real Folk Blues serving as the power anthem that feels just right as the send-off to each episode, whether it was funny, serious or downright tragic.\
The English dub, as I’ve said before, has become something of a measuring stick, to which all other anime dubs must compare themselves to. That’s not to say I think it’s the best dub of all time... There are still three that I think have surpassed it... But there are plenty of fans and critics who will make that claim, and it’s completely understandable why. The dub was directed by Mary Elizabeth Mcglynn, one of the most respected names in the dubbing industry, and for good reason. She also played several small roles in the cast, including the mysterious Julia and one of the more memorable villains, environmental extremist Twinkle Maria Murdock. Her adaptive script is accurate and on-point, despite slight changes to appeal to a western audiences, and I have to point this out, there are very rare occurrences where an actor will slip up and fail to match the character’s lip flaps. This barely ever happens, however, so it’s forgivable enough.\
In terms of acting, all four of the main characters have become the most iconic roles of their respective actors. Steve Blum has been considered a legend in the industry thanks to his turn as Spike Spiegel, a laid back and lethargic louse who cares for nothing other than his next paycheck, except for those rare moments that he’s made to care, either due to a resurgence of his past life or due to a fleeting chance at bringing some genuine good into the world. Beau Billingslea is a highly successful man in both his personal and professional lives, and he’s also one of the only well-known black voice actors in the anime dubbing industry, thanks in no small part to his performance of Jet Black, a former detective and the cool, mature voice of reason of the Bebop crew. Wendee Lee is a bit of a hit-or-miss actor for me, as the quality of her work seems to fluctuate from project to project, but she’s at her absolute best as Faye Valentine, a character who can be confident and duplicitous one minute but then vulnerable and emotionally raw the next.\
Then you have Melissa Fahn, who somehow managed to bring more insanity to the character of Ed than even the original seiyuu Aoi Tada. Her crazy ramblings also include random tangents in Japanese, which she fires off smoothly. Together, the four of them form a bizarre sort of chemistry that never quite feels like a proper family unit... They feel more like coworkers, tolerating each other and accepting each others’ eccentricities as they strive towards a common goal. That common goal, mind you, is the money to survive, something essential and vital, but also entirely impersonal. There’s no bonding between these characters, no intricate relationships, no changing each other’s paths and arcs... The characters let their guards down and show vulnerabilities, but almost never around each other, and the English cast is just as good at portraying this as the Japanese cast. Add to this the hilarious contributions by James Penrod as the raucous Cowboy Andy and Lia Sargent and Paul St. Pete as the Big Shot TV hosts Punch and Judy, I do highly recommend this dub over it’s original sub.\
I’ve always said, when defining what is and isn’t anime, that there really isn’t any set of qualities that can be taken into account consistently. No matter what rule you try to follow, there will always be outrageous exceptions made. The only philosophy that really makes sense is “Anime is made in Japan.” But for the people who actually try to draw a dividing line between anime and cartoons, there are a few arguments I keep hearing about. The first is that there’s an anime style. Big heads, giant tumorous eyes, small noses, exaggerated expressions... And another popular one is that anime is non-episodic, and tells a continuous story through plot progression and cohesive arcs. People will use these arguments as an excuse to call shows like Avatar and RWBY anime, and if you bring up shows like Shin-chan and Panty and Stocking, they’ll argue that those aren’t real anime, and were designed to be more like cartoons.\
But then you bring up Cowboy Bebop, a show that doesn’t waste it’s time with stereotypical anime expressions, doesn’t follow any alleged anime style, and for the most part, is episodic and full of filler. It’s heavily adult in it’s presentation, despite the fact that it doesn’t contain any gratuitous content... No giant boobs, no multi-episode fight scenes, no nudity or fanservice outside of a transexual dude and Faye occasionally sunbathing... No beach scenes, no hot springs episodes... Cowboy Bebop isn’t like any other anime, even the ones that have tried to copy it in the 20 years since it’s release. The idea of there being an anime style is quite frankly bullshit, as that’s a seriously reductive viewpoint on the medium, but aren’t the best anime the ones with engaging stories and involved plots? This isn’t even close to the case with Cowboy Bebop, a show that did horribly during it’s initial release in Japan, so why is it considered one of the best anime of all time? Why is it still a mainstay on American TV over a decade later?\
Well, there’s actually some backstory on that. When Bebop was initially released, the studio that played it got skittish about how adult it’s content was, and wound up airing it out of order, with several episodes left out entirely. This didn’t exactly build confidence with the audience, who weren’t even allowed to see the two best episodes, Ballad of Fallen Angels and Sympathy for the Devil. Keep in mind, this occurred in a country where that piece of shit Shadow Star was able to air on a Children’s Network. It was later run in it’s entirety on a less popular network named WOWOW, but the trouble it’s first network gave it provided a special kind of challenge for the series when it came to picking up steam. Heh, kinda reminds me of another series I know that got a lot of shit from it’s network, and was aired out of nowhere and treated unfairly by people who didn’t know how to handle it... In fact, you know what? Back up a bit. This show has a lot more in common with Firefly than just it’s initial problems, and I think I can use the comparison to explain why both shows are so immensely popular despite having a short run and a disastrous debut.\
There are plenty of similarities between Cowboy Bebop and Firefly, and considering the few things that the latter stole DIRECTLY from Outlaw Star, it wasn’t very likely a coincidence. Both shows feature an old, beaten down spaceship that acts as a surrogate home for a crew of misfits, surviving day to day on whatever jobs they can take in order to keep food on the table and fuel in the tank. The focus is on character more than plot, and most of the cast has extensive backstories that translate to other lives they’ve left behind, but are still haunted by. In both shows, Earth got used up, and humanity colonized the solar system, with no real aliens out there, and the territory is populated with an anachronistic array of settlements that the crew travels to and does business with. Firefly wound up being popular to this day for the same reason that Cowboy Bebop didn’t get popular until it reached the states... Because it’s a story that was designed to appeal to an American audience.\
Japanese society has always been deeply rooted in tradition and conformity. It’s true that a lot of it’s art has made valiant efforts to challenge the norm, from Kill La Kill’s blatant attack on said values, and Ikuhara’s work taking every opportunity to question the patriarchy, but for an anime to be about individuals who don’t fit into society making a life for themselves without any attachments outside of their own personal interests, with no real beliefs or values outside of their need to survive, and for this to come out way back in 1997, I find it more surprising that the series EVENTUALLY became big over there. But more to the point, Cowboy Bebop was, perhaps inadvertently, designed to be successful in America, so by ripping it off, Firefly became so popular that over fifteen years later, it has it’s own line of Lootcrate merch. And yet, despite the many similarities, Cowboy Bebop is still superior to Firefly in every conceivable way, and it’s able to be so without having to try nearly as hard as Firefly did.\
First off, as much as I love it, Firefly was never that great at drama. Yeah there was danger, and characters would die, but actual emotional conflict? It would pop up in small doses, but never in any engaging way. It also, like MANY series both here and in Japan, used dangling plot threads to keep you watching. There were mysteries to be solved, romantic interests to be resolved, conspiracies to unravel... When shows do this, it can be great, but it still feels like there’s a carrot dangling in front of your face, daring you to run towards it. It goes perhaps without saying that Cowboy Bebop had none of these issues. It never needs to try to grab your attention... You don’t need to worry about what’s going to happen later on in the story, because everything that’s happening is perfectly interesting on it’s own. You don’t just want to see the characters prevail, and overcome each obstacle, preserving the status quo, you want to see them overcome themselves and break the stasis they’ve surrounded themselves with in order to find whatever it is they’ve been missing.\
Cowboy Bebop is about four outcasts with nowhere to go, nowhere to call home, and pasts that they can no longer return to. In a sense, they’ve given up anything they once held dear in order to just survive day to day, putting their loved ones, morals and dreams aside because even if there is something for them to go back to, which isn’t always the case, doing so would carry unimaginable consequences, so you wind up having no idea whether you want them to find closure or just move forward. Anybody who’s held a job in order to pay the bills can immediately relate to this, and yet the fact that the crew of the Bebop have taken on even more uncertainty and risk by working a job that lets them hold onto a little bit of freedom by being their own bosses still makes them so easy to idolize. You get episodes of backstory for the entire main cast save for Ed, and these episodes are by far the best of the bunch because of everything they teach us about their past lives and how they wound up in this life, and then you’ll get the one-off episodes that are somehow just as awesome on their own, with so many imaginative and complex ideas that fit perfectly into the Bebop universe. All of these episodes, in their own way, explore the dichotomy of life, death, and the purpose that each serves.\
Cowboy Bebop was originally available from Bandai, both in individual cases and in a much more attractive Remix collection set, which was my copy of the series for years until Funimation bought the rights, and released it on Gorram Blu-Ray. I don’t care how much your physical copies of this series mean to you, you need to buy it on Blu-Ray. It’s a lot cheaper than the Amazon Exclusive version, although that one DOES come with a whole slew of bonus goodies. The movie, Knocking on Heaven’s door, is also available pretty cheap at most locations, and it’s also really great. The manga adaptations are also easily available stateside, although you’re best bet is to look online.\
Cowboy Bebop is not just an example of how anime can break it’s own rules and still be great, nor is it just an example of how good an anime from the nineties could look. It is also, and perhaps most importantly, an example of how a character driven story doesn’t need to have a plot, especially if it’s written in such a way that the characters ARE the plot. They’re all so likeable and so interesting that there are literally no boring moments throughout the series, because everything that happens involves them or is related to them in some way. I’ve heard some people complain about the crew not landing very many bounties, but I honestly think that’s the whole point. The ship is symbolic of the status quo that so many other shows rely on. As long as they stay there, sheltered from their old lives, they can never succeed, nor can they fail. They can never really live, nor can they die. They can only tread water, surviving. That might sound comfortable for some, but for Spike Spiegel, and ultimately for the philosophy of the series, it’s better to die young than to survive without living. This work, which has become a genre unto itself, is known as Cowboy Bebop, and I give it a 10/10. \

    I will be honest, I am not all that fond of Cowboy Bebop. I can understand why this anime is hyped as much as it is but with regards to my own personal taste in anime, it’s not that high up on the list. Nothing personal, just not my cup of tea. \
For me the biggest thing is, can I connect or feel some love for any of these characters and in all honesty, I couldn’t. I didn’t necessarily like or hate anyone character. I just felt indifferent. \
These characters are to put it simply, drifters. They don’t necessarily belong anywhere else except all together.\
          \
        The show revolves around their bounties and along the way, pieces of the crewmates personal lives come to light. \
 I was in all honesty disappointed at how things ended with Spike especially concerning the women he loved and his former partner. It felt anti-climatic. Way too fast. You could tell we were getting their but there wasn’t really any development. We got more development on Faye and Jet’s past, in the proper sense than we ever do with Spike. I honestly felt unsatisfied with his character development. \
The plot in general was very interesting. It’s like combing the old West in Space with Jazz and Blues music which you honestly wouldn’t think is a good combo but so is Gintama with space aliens and Meiji era samurai all in one mix. Some of the most surprising combinations go quite well together.\
I will have to say one thing, the music was amazing. Personally speaking I’m not really a big fan of this sort of music but I haven’t come across many anime that have such a unique musical style all their own. It’s Cowboy Bebop’s signature. ",

    Story:\
In the year 2071, much of the world has transferred to different planets and space crafts. Our two main characters: Spike and Jet, are bounty hunters, tracking down bounties and delivering the targets to the police to make money.\
Cowboy Bebop is a collection of stories with a arcing story throughout the whole series.\
Most of the stories are very well written and very dark and intense. What might put off some viewers is how slow the episodes are. Some episodes drag for little bit too long. But this recovered for the most part with episodes that are action packed and really fun.\
Rating: 9\
Art:\
The art in Cowboy\
          \
        Bebop is very stylistic and gritty. The characters designs are very unique, and each character looks very different.\
The whole style is also very reminiscent of noir movies from the 40s and 50s. The noir theme really gives the show its own identity.\
Rating: 10\
Sound:\
The soundtrack for the anime is fantastic. The show uses jazz very effectively to add to the atmosphere. The opening theme \"Tank\" is one of the most iconic anime themes ever and for good reason, its catchy and lets you know what you are getting into.\
Cowboy Bebop features one of the best dubs ever made. At many times its better the Japanese dub. The voices match perfectly to characters.\
Rating: 10\
Character:\
The characters in Cowboy Bebop make the show really fun to watch. The characters are:\
Spike, the closest character we have to a main character. He has an dark past and wants to run away from it. He has a fun personality with quick dialogue. Definitely one of the best characters.\
Jet, he's the captain of the Bebop and is an ex-police officer. He has a fake arm and legs. He's very stern but also very quick and clever. He has very good dialogue with Spike and is great because of it.\
Faye, coming in at episode 3, throughout the whole series Faye is probably the one who grows the most. She is cocky and mean. But really is a good person. It's always fun seeing how she is going to get out of a situation.\
Edward, coming in at episode 9, Edward is 13 year old girl, who is a computer hacker and loud mouth. She is quite annoying in some cases, yet fine in others. She's a very mixed bag and feels a little out of place.\
Rating: 8\
Overall Rating and Enjoyment:\
Cowboy Bebop is a classic, and a anime that nobody should miss. That said it isn't perfect and has many problems. My enjoyment went up and down as the series went on. But the ending is one of the best anime endings and I did feel satisfied when it ended.\

    Widely regarded as a gateway anime for many out there, Cowboy Bebop was a critical success and during the early 2000’s created a massive following in the States. Directed by the ever successful Shinichiro Watanabe (Macross Plus) and produced by the massive Studio Sunrise, the budget and talent was there to succeed.\
Set in an era where mankind has colonized space and other planets, the story of Cowboy Bebop is told in the storytelling format in episodic fashion. Many anime fault the standalone episode way due to poor character development and lack thereof for any story. In the case of Bebop, this is done to almost\
          \
        perfection with the viewer able to jump into just about any episode. Sometimes an episode will focus on one character just to develop their character and explain their past. Our main characters are bounty hunters, referred to as “cowboys” in which help out tracking down criminals and such to get their payday. The achievement of this series to gain such a connection between episodes and to the characters themselves is what many other anime have trouble doing in a regular story. This speaks volumes to the high quality Bebop has.\
Art and sound hits the viewer instantly when the opening to the series begins, and never lets up. Animation still holds up with some of the best ever. Compared to an anime like Outlaw Star which was running at the time shows volume to how high Bebop set the bar. Sound and music were very unique where a band was literally created for the show. Its’ mixture of rock, blues, and jazz somehow matches the space action, and even the drama the anime sets in between. Not many anime can honestly hold up animation or even for the music to be so memorable. Even the voice acting, whether it’s watched in Japanese or English, is also among the best example set in anime. Mixing in the sound effects ranging from crazy gun fights to the waves hitting rocks in the sea, almost everything in this anime is done to almost perfection.\
Considered an anime classic, it is hard to argue why. The only fault that Cowboy Bebop has is the lack of a continuous story, but that’s not what this sci-fi western adventure is. If that isn’t what a fan is into then still give Cowboy Bebop a chance at the very least. There is so much to love and being one of the most watched anime of all time, it’s easy to see why.\

    Cowboy Bebop has been, since it's release in 1998, the bar by which every new anime series is judged by. It's just that good. Many have described it as 1970's cop show-meets western-meets high-quality drama-meets film-noir, and I am gonna have to agree with them.\
Cowboy Bebop revolves around futuristic bounty hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet Black, and the series is really just their exploits through the universe. Along the way, they meet female bounty hunter Faye Valentine, computer hacker Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky 4th (simply Ed for short), data dog Ein, and various bounties and figures from their past.\
The beauty of Cowboy Bebop is\
          \
        that although the show does have a recurring story based around Spike's past, this is more or less tossed aside for \"filler\" episodes, or one episode storylines. Through filler episodes, we make a very strong bond and attachment to these characters, and it makes the ending to it all the more heartfelt.\
When I watch Cowboy Bebop, I really do feel what happens to the characters. You feel sympathy and plight, happiness and joy, sadness and sorrow. You care about the characters, and I commend the staff who worked on the series for doing this. Very few anime series have characters for whom you can actually relate to, build bonds to emotionally, and frankly, give a damn about. Cowboy Bebop pulls it off with elegance and grace, as if it were nothing.\
All in all, Cowboy Bebop is one of the best anime ever created, hands down. it has excellent characters, wonderful storylines, beautiful animation, and mesmorizing locales. It remains to be one of my favorites of all time.\

    First review; bear with me. Now I'm sure this anime has been done to death, but reviewing it was irresistible since it was one of the first animes I watched, thus making a pretty lasting impression on me. Cowboy Bebop provided an extremely smooth transition from familiar American cartoons to a literally foreign arena. This show takes action to a new level, with a plethora of heart palpitating adventures which not only delve into the blatant physical aspects of the characters and setting, but the development of interpersonal relationships amongst them.\
For those unfamiliar with Cowboy Bebop, the entire show is essentially the prologue to a\
          \
        main story that the audience never explicitly discovers. That being said, there are ups and downs to this plot set up. One of the more commendable aspects is the show's lack of straightforward obviousness in several areas, despite apparent inter-galactic shootouts and dog fights. This is especially noted in the character development of Spike and Faye, as well as the bond between them. At first glance, Spike is your stereotypical uninterested protagonist emitting a cool aura, while Faye is a rogue heroine bad ass– if you will. You would expect a fairly predictable relationship between them following the lines of an abrupt love forming... Yadda yadda. However, a more subtle form of trust and understanding blossoms between them not through cheesy confessions, or transparent words, but exhilarating action! What better way to convey love is there?\
That being said, predictability isn't necessarily a bad thing. Mind-numbing action probably isn't the ideal form of entertainment for some of you more analytic audiences, but the simplicity of the show made it easy to follow and more enjoyable. Missing an episode won't leave you puzzled and without important information, since you're basically guaranteed a complete adventure every episode, which leads me to my last point.\
The creators of Cowboy Bebop went a little far with the whole idea of it being a prologue, and in certain instances, there were a lot of cases of ambiguity. The three main characters of course are given some sort of backstory, however not all of it was logically explained. For example, Spike's relationship with the main villain is described as once being on the same side, and now they hate each other, but not how exactly they got to that point. \
Overall Cowboy Bebop has minor issues, but they certainly don't overshadow the immense entertainment, and joy the show brings to any audience. An excellent starter anime, and timeless classic.  \

    Cowboy Bebop is a good choice for you if you're looking for some well animated action series, where you don't have to follow along on an overarching plot, and prefer to kick back to some episodic stories. If you dislike episodic structures, note that Cowboy Bebop does develop its characters, but very slowly, and has continuity in its universe, but its structure relies on building any story it wants with the cast for the most part, while defining the traits of who those characters are. It doesn't promise you anything for the next episode it will deliver. And note that if you dislike when a\
          \
        series isn't particularly colorful, Cowboy Bebop's animation might not come off as well animated, since it's an old anime and stuff didn't use to be very colorful back then.\
You see, modern day  anime rely a lot on being colored puddles of puke, where they assort everything with plenty of colors, but without paying particular attention to how it contrasts with everything, and how the viewer will notice the particular details presented in it. It is easy to sell and hook someone with something that is easy on the eye to simply become eyecandy. However, both the cinematography and animation here is what shines, with the series making good use of lightning and camera angles to create really interesting shots and engaging fights. It also paid attention to the motion of the characters, and to certain small details that give the animation life, such as the trembling of someone who is holding a gun in their hands when nervous, as an example. But what I appreciate most about it is the fact that it knows exactly how much detail to put into each shot, as it didn't have the technology or budget to simply build gargantuous images. Rather, it knew how to animate exactly what we'd be paying attention to. Rather than constantly pay attention to the landscape and constantly create beautiful scenery nobody will really focus on, it chooses on focusing on the details that are relevant to the movement of the characters, like the lightning of the shadows, the way things break upon impact and other such little details that make each action scene be more engaging. In other words, it has a great sense in what is relevant to present in a scene, over what would make it look more pretty and it focuses on substance rather than appeal.\
The structure of the anime was episodic, mostly focusing on delivering action romps, while developing certain details about the world and its space setting. It did focus on the characters occasionally, but it mostly relied on being capable of using their default state to create some episodic action setpieces. While it is indeed episodic I do want to compliment Cowboy Bebop that it follows an episodic structure that I'd deem respectable. It doesn't promise you it will get somewhere necesarily, as it doesn't have a clear defined end goal for an overarching plot and that's good, because you won't feel like the episode you are watching is a mere waste of time due to the fact it does not progress the plot. But it also has continuity with the characters undergoing some events that give them motivations, but in a way that doesn't break their intended roles, so they can used as a formula. So not everything is gonna be constant and could go through some slight changes at any time which can hook the viewer, but it will never have the risk to break familiarity. It doesn't lie about what it tries to deliver unlike some anime that present you an overarching plot, while taking a lot of side trips that only artificially progress to the end goal of the plot. Cowboy Bebop merely tries to entertain, and that's it. As far as you can expect from it, expect anything, but with the only constant being action and/or suspense that get solved under 20 minutes.\
How it tries to entertain is simply by delivering some good looking action scenes in an interesting setting. Personally, the setting kinda took away a bit of my enjoyment, merely because the understanding of space that we had when Cowboy Bebop was produced, as well as certain tropes that existed then, is far different to that of the current day. As an example, someone got worried about some explosives flying in space and said it would be a great threat to travelers, but how would explosives ignite in a place with no oxygen, like space. So when you watch Cowboy Bebop, you have to twist your view of scifi a little bit, as the futuristic setting imagined is far different to our preset one now. Things such us not expecting to colonize planets such as Mars and Venus, that happened in Cowboy Bebop, which are uninhabitable planet, might sound to you as a little far fetched with no explanations. The novelty of the setting is absent, but it is charming in the way of \"so that's how people thought this was gonna turn out\" kind of way. And the setting itself doesn't really take away from either the drama or the action pieces presented in the episodes.\
Personally, I consider Cowboy Bebop to be one of the best possible results out of old fashioned anime. In terms of detail, it tries to liven its world up by bringing up small details in the movement and good cinematography, which give it great artistic value. Maybe you won't get something incredibly colorful or as detailed as something that can be animated today, but it is animated in a way that the key elements someone would focus on shine through. In terms of writing, it creates any story it wants at any point, while also being capable of progressing its characters forward. It knows what ground rules to set and how to leave them open ended enough to be potentially interesting for a larger group of people, which is how something commercially viable was aimed back then, rather than subgroups. But it does so in a manner that does not seem like pandering to the masses, because of the fact that it is diversified enough. And I think they did the best with the setting they've created as they possibly could've done at the time it was created. Frankly, I think it is at its maximum potential of what it strived to be, and that is what I found most appealing upon rewatching. That all the criticisms I could deliver are merely due to its age, from mentality of the characters, to animation and the way it was delivered. \
Now that doesn't mean any concerns about it are unvalidated. It is episodic so you won't follow through on a sound story with a beginning, middle and an end, but rather, a bunch of adventures meant to entertain. Some people prefer to see the bigger picture for entertain value, rather than focus on tangents, and in Bebop, while there may not be such things as tangents, there's no such thing as a bigger picture either. Some people might not enjoy something merely due to the fact that it contains action and suspense, so those details can get lost on you quite easily and Cowboy Bebop immediately losing its value. And the setting itself hasn't aged as well as other things in science fiction, and if you can't watch it from the perspective of novelty, or accept some of its shortcomings because it was novelty at the time, the setting won't hold much value. But I personally can't help but respect Bebop and consider it good. It tried its best to be as innovative as it could, while also trying to appeal to everyone by following a structure that will allow change but a lot of constants in it as well and the animation was done in a manner that the shortcomings of the era don't really take away from it, outside of a few dated animation techniques that won't hold today and don't really get used much.\
Cowboy Bebop is one of the best things that could've aired in the late 90's. But is it one of the best things that you could watch today? That's the question you should answer yourself, when deciding to watch Cowboy Bebop. I strongly recommend watching Bebop from an artistical sense, if you're a fan of good animation or anime in general, to see what's the highest potential an animated series of that age could achieve in that department. But whether or not you will be entertained by it, strictly depends on you, as the value of it can vary from episode to episode, and its setting is dated enough for you to create your own inconsistencies. Frankly, the question is as simple as this: Do you generally enjoy short selfconcluded action stories?\

    At 2071, Earth is not the only habitable planet in the Solar System. With the advent of hyperspace technology comes new rules, eras, laws, law-breakers and law-enforcers. Aboard the shuttle Bebop, bounty hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet Black struggle, bounty after bounty, with unruly shipmates, mutated-lobsters and vengeful old-timers from the past, all while keeping the Bebop afloat.\
My reasons as to why Cowboy Bebop is a must see:\
1. Spike Spiegel\
2. The Real Folk Blues soundtrack, and;\
3. Session 5: the Ballad of the Fallen Angels\
Cowboy Bebop is a straight-forward anime. Spanning 26 episodes called sessions, Cowboy Bebop boasts of great character designs, fluid animation, splendid voice\
          \
        acting and one hell of a soundtrack.\
Cowboy Bebop is synonymous with great music. Each session is entitled with reference to a musical concept or title, and each session is buoyed by the ever present tunes and strains of jazz and blues, composed by the great Yoko Kanno.\
Animation-wise, the series has outstanding visuals all throughout its entire season. Movement and action are beautifully designed (most especially Spike's fight scenes using jeet kune do) and top-notch. Those who prefer the visuals over the everything else will not be disappointed.\
Combine great visuals, with great music, plus great characters and great story, this is one anime every anime lover should watch (See how many greats I used in just one sentence??)\
My only qualm with the series, a qualm that's quite insignificant, really, is the way the characters' backstory are never really fully explored. Conclusions and closures are, by turns, done during the first and last half of the season. Though all sessions are still enjoyable and comedic, it would have been nice if sessions devoted to the main characters story arcs were explored.\
Still, Cowboy Bebop is one-giant step above other animes, one that should not be missed. Grab/borrow/rip/steal a copy and you've got yourself one big bounty\

    Cowboy Bebop sets the bar. I take that back; it's nonsense to set the best as a standard. Not only does it put many others in its genre to shame, but many Hollywood productions should also cower in fear of this magnificent masterpiece.\
Bebop's episodic nature is exemplary of what artists can do with anime. It has story arcs, but it also has independent episodes like the throwback to Alien and the terrifying one about Pierrot Le Fou. This flexibility allowed its artists to explore a wide variety of themes while maintaining consistency. The storycraft occasionally walks a fine line between detail and ambiguity at times,\
          \
        much like film noir of old, but it never feels muddled. From the iconic Swordfish spaceship to the space casinos, the cyberpunk and \"used universe\" atmosphere is realized by the art, which really brings the believable near-future world to life. \
Furthermore, Watanabe's direction is truly masterful; each episode feels complete and whole, and the series has great pacing as well. Watanabe also provided brilliant direction to action sequences, with fights paying homage to Bruce Lee and breathtaking chase scenes.\
Great characters are essential to a character-driven plot, and Cowboy Bebop shines in this regard. The series features amazing characters that build on archetypes with their own twists. Their backstories work in tandem with the archetypes, which makes them all the more memorable and not mere caricatures. Character interactions are relatable and meaningful, always with genuine chemistry. \
The series' music deserves a special section all of its own. Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts really made a timeless hit with every single song they wrote for Bebop. The soundtrack prominently features jazz such as the iconic OP \"Tank!\" but also slow-paced blues and even pop music. It is difficult to write about music, as preferences in thus is such a basic if not primal sensation. The most I can say is that if you like jazz and blues, you will fall in love with the soundtrack immediately; if not, you really might start liking these genres.\
This series had the gall to include the line \"and the work which has become a genre unto itself shall be called: Cowboy Bebop\" in the OP. The nerve of them to do that...and yet I find myself wholeheartedly agreeing with them. Cowboy Bebop is the ultimate combination of a great storyline, endearing characters, amazing music, and you will never watch anything quite like it. This is undoubtedly a classic, and my favorite anime series of all time.\

    Cowboy Bebop is the result of a perfectly mixed drink. On the surface, it’s a futuristic space western about a ragtag group of bounty hunters during their adventures and misadventures. If you take a closer look, however, you will see sprinkled throughout a perfect mix of genres: dashes of horror, comedy, crime, romance, tragedy, philosophy, action, and parody all combined into one neat package. Each episode is a little different from the others by following the same cast of characters from all facets and angles. With each unique episode comes its own strain of music; from tribal drums and chants to electronic pulses. And yet\
          \
        each song and episode somehow always fills you with the emotions that come with its namesake: bebop, blues and jazz. Despite airing around 15 years ago, Cowboy Bebop has continued to hold its place as one of the greatest anime shows ever to be created, a fact cemented by its vast array of awards and the legacy that followed in its wake. \
\9The brew that is Cowboy Bebop gets is aroma and flavor from its cast of characters. At first glance, they are a strange group of characters that are only in bounty hunting for the quick cash so they can eat. As the series progresses, the characters are slowly revealed and their intentions known. You first think Spike to be a slacker who does the bare minimum on the job, only to learn later of his past in the criminal underground and the loss that killed him emotionally. Jet is the gruff authority figure until you realize he cares deeply for the crew as family. Faye is your typical wild and free female lead but only because her deep set tragic background has forced her to push away any sort of relationship. Ed is an amazing hacker prodigy who has no rhyme or reason until you learn of her past and deprived childhood. The diverse casting, build up, and execution provides a strong set of personalities that the viewer is easily able to get behind and root for.\
\9This blend of a show solidifies itself a diverse soundtrack and fluid animation, even by today’s standards. Each of the 26 episodes have a certain spunk to them, whether they be comedy or tragedy. Some argue that one season’s worth is hardly enough to really flesh out what this series could have been. While this may be true, this series does a splendid job of mixing itself into one strong, dynamic, and satisfying experience that caps itself off just at the peak of its ability.",

    Hmm...what to say about Cowboy Bebop. Well, it's definitely a show that has it's ups and downs. Sometimes you'll watch it and be like \"this episode sucks\" and other ones will have you at the edge of your seat/couch. The antics of the main characters are hilarious but underneath their humerous appearance lay hidden secrets and sad pasts. Like most anime, it has it's action scenes and love scenes. It's worth watching if you can get past a few of the not so exciting episodes. But like I said, there's only a few that the series could do without. In the end howevere, it's worth\

    I think Cowboy Bebop is overrated. OK now fans of the 90's with your torches and pitchforks calm down and let me have my own opinion. personally, while I do see why people love this anime I think they're reading too much into it and worse, some of them overhype it to such a degree that other better anime in my opinion suffer from unjust criticism. Note that if you like it a lot, fine I respect your opinion, I really do, nor do I think less of anyone who does. Just don't call me immature just because I don't like it because, I am\
          \
        NOT an idiot. OK?\
Now why didn't I like it? I can't simply list the stuff I liked and didn't like so I'll review the show as a whole. Everyone says that they like it for the characters, animations, simple plot and the narrative which is supposed to be subtle and leaves a lot to the imagination of the viewer.\
Animation is very, very good and the action is some of the greatest (well, most of the time. The 'fight' in episode 19 sucked) and the soundtrack, with or without the way it was used is one of the greatest ever. Favorite tracks include Blue, Call me Call me, The Real Folk Blues, Ask DNA and of course Tank!\
Before I talk about the plot, let me talk about the characters. Spike and Faye are without a doubt the most interesting characters in the whole show. Faye herself starts off as a 'femme fatale' character that dislikes men and tries manipulating them for her own wants. We later see what gave her this mind set and her back-story was believable and rather tragic, so much so I actually did feel sorry for her. She does develop a lot through what I deem intense suffering and I like how she gets a crush o Spike. Speaking of Spike, he's also a complex character, one who is fairly sympathetic and compelling. Despite being really lazy and only cares about food and playing pool because he believes life is nothing but a dream, he still searches for and loves his missing girlfriend. OK, so far so good but Spike has a really grating flaw of being very reckless and wild when chasing his bounty. We've seen him engage in dogfights with a lot of his bounty whilst being inside a populated city too many times to count. Because of this, the show states, a lot of the bounty they do get ends up being used to pay for property damage. Oi, writers, what about the hundreds of people Spike accidently massacred? To make this worse, some of the people he is chasing aren't necessarily a threat like Jet's ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend Rint. I mean dude, they were on a cheap boat, stop trying to kill them just because you’re hungry. Geez.\
Jet while still complex has a really clichéd back-story and I didn't care much for his character whilst Ed is Ed; she's funny and can even be cute but that’s about it. She doesn't have that much depth as a character. Vicious was an interesting and effective villain though. I actually did want to know more about him and his plans and motivations are actually interesting. The same cannot be said for most of the other villains. Pierrot le Fou as I said was a boring character and his back-story is also really clichéd. I mean come on, how many time have we seen a villain who becomes evil because of torture before? How many villains also have an amusement park of doom as their secret hideout? And is it me or did episode 20 of Bebop have much more fluid animation than usual?\
Now, you'll tell me that Bebop's main appeal isn't the plot so much as the characters who themselves are supposed to be everyday type of people; you'll tell me that Bebop is more about the experience, that it wanted people to feel rather than give them a normal 3 (or 4) act story. Note I love works of fiction that are supposed to be more of an experience and don't necessarily have a plot and I also love different characters. Sadly, I didn't find the world of Bebop or the premise that interesting. I didn't care for the characters that much, I didn't care for the world and I also didn't experience anything from Bebop's story that other anime have given me. The only time I can say I actually felt anything was in episode 24 with the scene where the song Call me plays. I actually did cry at that scene but that’s it. The rest of the series didn't give me anything that would make me feel sad, angry, sick, happy or anything. Yeah, do you remember that scene in episode 26 where a friend of the protagonist dies? Yeah, I didn't cry because I did not care.\
They say that Bebop's narrative style relies not only on the music but also on the lack of back-story, letting people draw up their own conclusions. Draw up conclusions to what? What motivates the characters to act like they do? I guess it did work pretty well sometimes but not all of the time and this is another major flaw I found with Bebop. I didn't care for most of characters because I didn't know a lot about them and what I knew were too vague. In a work of fiction you can't build off a character based on mere hints: we must have a reason to care and the only character I really cared for was Faye as her back-story wasn't clichéd in the least and she was actually interesting. \
Even Spike who is an interesting character on his own suffered from me not caring because I didn't get his mindset. What made him believe that life is just a dream? What made him give up on life? What DO Spike and Julia see in each other? No, scratch that, somebody tell me what is so interesting about Julia because other than being Spike's girlfriend and one who cares for him a lot, I don't know much about her. I don't know what Spike sees in her, how they got off and developed their relationship and when things start to take a turn for the worse for them, I found myself not caring because as I said, I didn't have a reason to care about this relationship. In other good anime and manga like Berserk, Rurouni Kenshin, Sankarea, Clannad etc... we actually see the main couple develop feelings for each other over time, so much so that when they do suffer it becomes all the more heartbreaking. Bebop, didn't show Spike and Julia developing. They just got it off (I guess) and pretended to leave their relationship to our imagination. Explain anime, explain!\
With this thought process, am I to assume that Ed became the way she is because she had to roam the world because her father abandoned her? There are plenty of children who are homeless and yet aren't insane so what on earth drove Edward to become like that? Something more sinister maybe...\
I also disagree with the line ''And the work which has become a genre unto itself shall be called: Cowboy Bebop.'' I find it pretentious and non-sensical because no matter how many genres it crammed into its 26 episodes, it didn't explore every genres strengths and devices and in the end it is and will always be a science fiction action show.\
The absolute worst flaw Bebop has though is the lack of plot and character development and over reliance on filler episodes. The best episodes like Jupiter Jazz, The Real Folk Blues, Hard Luck Woman and of course, Ballad of Fallen angels all had character development or a new revelation about the most interesting characters namely, Spike and Faye. Most of the time though, the show was spent on the 'gang' either tracking a boring clichéd villain (like Pierrot le Fou and the Space eco-terrorists), not very funny comedy antics (Mushroom Samba, Cowboy Funk and Toys in the Attic) and sometimes, I found myself absolutely bored by the show with really pointless episodes (like Speak like a Child and the horrible Wild Horses).\
Now, I'm someone whom likes good episodes that don't necessarily advance the plot but instead reveal more about the characters and the world they live in. Cry for the devil was very good and so was My Funny Valentine. Ganymede Elegy was a good episode showing more of Jets back-story and Gateway Shuffle was rather intense and atmospheric. Most of the other episodes weren't like that. My least favorite Bebop episode is Wild Horses: there wasn't an interesting fight scene, the characters introduced were very forgettable and we didn't find out more about the world of Bebop because the episode TOOK PLACE IN A FREAKING DESERT FULL OF UNINTERESTING SAND! The episode before it was just as bad because half of it is just Jet and Spike searching in vain for a VCR in order to play the mysterious video tape Faye received. Some people thought the entire struggle was funny: I thought the writers were too lazy and I don't want to pass through a boring episode like that just to get one sad moment that lasted 3 minutes. Someone told me that episode 19 was important in showing how Spike and Jet's relationship worked and again, I don't want to pass through a boring episode like that only to see two characters exchange a few lines and pretend that I'm seeing something deep.\
I think I'd have given the series a much higher rating had it been shorter and most episodes having focused on the plot and character development because when it did focus on the plot, Bebop was amazing and without a doubt those episodes had the best moments and use of music. My final verdict for Bebop is a 7 for good. It's just an action show, a good action show but just an action show. It doesn't deserve a 10 because it's not that deep nor inspiring, nor do I think it  is the masterpiece most fans of the 90's think it is and no, Bebop fans, the worst of Bebop is NOT better than the best of anime. Period. There are plenty of anime that are vastly superior to Bebop in both characterization and writing. However, as I said, it's not horrible or downright bad and it does stay with you.\

All of the characters (except Jet and Faye) are dull and lifeless especially the stereotypical bounty hunter and gangster spike spiegel. He is a wasted character who tries to be compared to Bruce Lee and Lupin the third and Steve Blum's voice acting makes him sound like a creepy pedophile. \

    Cowboy Bebop is an absolute classic. Most people would say this is 'the pinnacle of all anime shows'. While there are some aspects of the show I liked, to say that this is the BEST of the BEST seems a little far-fetched to me.\
Cowboy Bebop is set in the distant future where space travel has been developed. Bounty hunters exist around the solar system to capture criminals and survive by being rewarded for their bounty. The story centres around 4 main characters - Spike Spiegel, Jet Black, Faye Valentine and Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV (or Ed) and it tells us of their journeys\
          \
        and struggles.\
I'll get a lot of the repeated praises out of the way first, before people completely disregard the whole review for the issues I had with the show.\
The animation is splendid - that, I simply cannot deny. For a 1998 anime, the quality definitely rivals the most up to date ones and still surpasses a vast majority of them. The movements of the characters and attention to detail in the backgrounds are so crisp clean, it is virtually eye candy for any viewer.\
Another thing Cowboy Bebop succeeds in is the soundtrack. The opening song 'Tank!' is one of the most iconic tune in anime history and will be immediately recognised by most anime watchers. Although the opening song and background music aren't suited to my tastes (by that I mean I wouldn't listen to them on my MP3 player) it sets the mood perfectly for a lot of the scenes within the show. Another compliment goes to the ending theme song 'The real folk blues' which I frickin love (Now THAT is on my MP3 playlist).\
As for the voice acting, both the English and Japanese voice actors/actresses have done a wonderful job bringing the characters to life. Their performances in their own respective languages has virtually no flaws. So if you ask me which language to watch it in, it would be - it doesn't matter, both are good, it really is up to you.\
Now here's where I must be careful of what I say...\
So why couldn't I enjoy this as much as the 99% of people who declare that this is the definition of masterpiece? I guess the main reason would be the episodic nature of the show. Of course this is subjective from person to person. I personally would have liked to see the characters have an overall goal where a satisfying conclusion is met rather than individual episodes with their own plots.\
But that isn't where the real problem lies. A good show should have a great start which draws the viewer in, a strong central story where character development can take place and finally, it should have a memorable ending. Unfortunately, the first few episodes of Cowboy Bebop aren't that entertaining. It's average at best but nothing spectacular to draw the audience into the show, if anything pretty standard fair to introduce all the characters.\
It picks up its pace and starts to get interesting when it reaches the episode 'Ballad of Fallen Angels' (episode 5). I don't want to spoil anything, but this is the first episode where the anime gets more serious. We learn a little about Spike's past and it starts to get more fascinating... BUT here's where I feel Cowboy Bebop fails at. The episode just ends. It side tracks to something else. The next episode is something completely different, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it feels that what I've just seen gets abandoned - tossed to the side. Any tension built up from the previous episode is just gone and this happens throughout the show and I get really irritated.\
I want to know more, but it never gives me that satisfaction. It's like the series is about to show something interesting, but then completely forgets about it in .5 of a second. It would be okay if the episodes after the 'serious' ones were JUST AS fascinating. But this simply isn't the case. They are decent/fine at best and this contrast from watching something amazing to plain average constantly gives the feeling of disappointment. Now this doesn't make it a bad show. It just means the series is average to worth watching at best but nothing spectacular for it to be called a 'masterpiece'.\
One more thing to add to the individual plots for the other episodes. It is either hit or miss in terms of how entertaining it is. There were some which I would have liked a continuation of, however, in most cases it just ends. It isn't a coincidence that the only episodes I genuinely enjoyed were the ones where they reveal a little about why the characters are the way they are now - a prime example would be Faye Valentines past. And as for the other episodes, I feel \"meh\" towards them.\
Finally, for the ending... it's very good... I don't want to talk about it as it contains spoilers. All I can say is, it's a very fitting way to end the show. (yay! another compliment!)\
Maybe I'm being too harsh in this review... hmm... okay... so if the story isn't a masterpiece, surely the characters should be able to 'carry' the series - so entertaining that simple actions by them make the whole show a masterpiece. Unfortunately, they aren't the most jaw dropping fascinating characters I've seen. Now before you shoot me down with a bazooka: allow me to explain; the main characters are very interesting but I feel that the show does nothing with them. I understand that Spike is supposed to be cool but the story doesn't do much to show that. Yes he is good looking, yes he has a sense of justice, yes he fights like a boss but... that seems like a stereotype to me. I would have liked to know more about his past, what did he suffer to become the way he is? Why is he so attached to Julia? These kind of questions pop-up not just for Spike but for the other main characters too. One possible reason for this could be Cowboy Bebop only has 26 episodes, it's quite difficult to explain everything in such a short time span.\
Though the biggest problem for me was the supporting characters. I simply didn't give a damn about them. I wasn't particularly attached to them nor were they particularly memorable. Naturally for an episodic show like this, there are guaranteed to be characters which will be more interesting than others. The problem is, I felt no attachment to approximately 95% of the characters.\
Let me give an example of one of the supporting characters, Vicious. He is the most interesting support character (in my opinion) and is supposedly the villain of the show but I can't help but question things like \"why is Vicious like this?\", \"why is he supposedly the villain?\", \"what are his motivations?\" It feels as though he's just there for us to 'agree' that he is a bad guy when there's no real reason for it. This is what I mean by the contrast of the serious episodes to the non-serious ones. I'm about to learn something from Vicious but the next episode just completely abandons the idea with the metaphorical 'episodic reset button'.\
All in all though, the main characters aren't bad but they aren't ones where I would stare in awe at everything they say. The supporting characters are - well to put it bluntly, weak. By that I mean they simply aren't memorable and it's not something where you would look back and go \"maaan that young child who shot Spike is so cool - he's one really likable character\" I hope at least one or two people can catch the gist of what I'm trying to say.\
Now, let me just say Cowboy Bebop is by no means a bad show. Far from it actually. It passes with flying colours in the presentation aspect but I simply couldn't buy into the episodic style of the story with characters that didn't really do anything. I just don't think it truly is the 'pinnacle of all anime shows'. However, it harbours a 'worth watching' in my rating system and should be viewed by anyone as it is STILL a classic.\

    Okay, I may be a bit suspicious to talk about the work, maybe I overdid it in the notes, no, I do not believe that, but okay, I'll start\
I love this anime a lot, and it's funny how I get myself thinking about the work, about the different themes covered and, of course, the sad but great ending, the end of the series really complies with the word, it's an end, you feel complete , May have a taste of want more, but to see that the 26 episodes were satiating\
The universe of Cowboy Bebop is very well built, it is already a time when\
          \
        space exploration worked, year 2071 (Unfortunately that year there will be no colony by the Solar System), Bounty Hunters earn a living in this new profession, In a new way of living\
The art, as well as other animes of the 90's is fantastic, I find incredible the air that these styles bring, movements, in the action scenes are mainly fluid, and even the expressions of characters fascinate, this looking at every detail of scene, Without mentioning the very good animation that heaven possesses\
The music is something else the fantastic part, starting from the opening, Tank! Like other songs that play during the series, and that curiously has a style of Jazz well pulled for the Bebop, and the fantastic music of closing, The Real Folk Blues, same name of the last two episodes, in addition the name of the episodes always has the See with music, and this is too interesting\
And what to talk about the characters, my every character very well built, you play a character, and with the passing of the episodes you will know more of each one, the characteristic past of each and what is good, the outcome, Episode for episode You know each character, and I come to talk about the specific episodes of Jet and Faye, first Jet's, which are very engaging and serious, I love the rhythm of these episodes, Faye's, to know about her past Is very good, and I see that these specific episodes of Faye kind of sad because the history of her past is, I will not comment anything, if you want to know you have to watch, not to mention the other main characters like Spike that is a great Protagonist and Ed who is the hyperactive child, can not dislike it, in fact, there is no way to dislike anyone, even Ein, the dog is super charismatic (but I think all dogs are) secondary characters Which appear, such as Andy, Appledelhi (I think is the strongest character in the anime) and Tongpu (His story is very interesting)\
The Rhythm of the anime really runs very well, I recommend it to everyone ..........\

It’s undeniable that anime as an entertainment medium has a fair number of series that are considered classics. Among these, Cowboy Bebop is a name you hear relatively often. First released in 1998, only its first half was aired initially due to its “adult themes” and today it invokes nostalgia in many viewers. Certainly, compared to other shows of its time it has aged fantastically due to strong characterisation, a tone that stands out from the masses even today and animation that screams “vintage” rather than\
          \
        simply “old”. Now, after having watched Cowboy Bebop myself, I can see why it was so prominent back in its day while still feeling that it doesn’t have the spark needed to be considered truly ageless.\
What Cowboy Bebop does really well, in comparison, is its characterisation. They’re deeper than your average fare and consistent to boot, as well as being fun to watch. For all of that, however, they’re not particularly memorable and I put part of that down to the lack of overarching story and part down to the fact that they develop independently of each other rather than via interaction. In the episodes that are important for characterisation, the individual of the hour tends to go off and do their own thing with minimal contact with the rest of the crew. While it reflects their tenuous links to each other well and makes sense, it also renders it harder to make the group as a whole stand out.\
Summary – When Cowboy Bebop first aired it would have made major waves, so I have no trouble understanding why viewers still look back on it fondly. The animation and characters have stood the test of time excellently and just about every other aspect of the show could stand up to newer counterparts without shame. Unfortunately, the series as a whole lacks the cohesion granted by overarching plotlines that is needed to really shine and make itself memorable in the current day, and its meagre attempts at cultivating that are more detrimental than enjoyable. Still, if you like more gritty and relatively serious anime then Cowboy Bebop is well worth a try. After all, it’s a classic for a reason.\

    Well, that was all over the place. I think I finally ''got'' this series just about the time I finished it... maybe, I mean, I now kinda get how it's great and unique in a way. That there's a reason it's held in high regards. But I can't ignore that I was pretty much bored by at least a third of it. What I disliked about it: old production means it's slow. Seriously, 120-130% seems like natural playback speed in most cases. It's very episodic, and one of things I most like about serious anime is that they're often not episodic. \
However, it's hard to\
          \
        call Bebop serious. At times it's downright trolling the viewer, similar as Champloo (also by Watanabe). Troll moments and episodes were probably my favorite parts as I felt they were comical and really effective given the setting. Then there are many ''serious'' episodes that just cover some minor side story, and I found most of them boring. Most of them would provide some minor character or plot development and rely on rule of cool a lot, as nearly all action is spectacle, often with troll physics included. Not in TTGL sense, but not too far either. It takes some getting used to since setting and style appear quite serious/real. \
Then there are episodes that really develop and explore a particular character, and even episodes that explore serious topics and cover them surprisingly well. I felt that characters took forever to develop, which resulted in me only feeling attached to them by the time of ending episodes. Naturally, it made me enjoy the last third of the anime more, and pretty great ending only adds to it. Animation is great for its time, but it's really aged and I can't say I didn't mind. I think I would have enjoyed it much more if it was less episodic, picked up the pace, cut out a third of the episodes, and switch focus from being all over the place to comedy, at least in earlier episodes. It's similar to Champloo in many ways, but I definitely liked Champloo better.\

    For those who haven't caught any of the show or the hype, Cowboy Bebop initially involves just two guys, Spike and Jet, who are trying to make a living as interstellar bounty hunters. They travel from system to system trying to earn rewards for bringing in various and sundry criminals in their heap of a spaceship named the Bebop. As their journeys continue, we learn more about their pasts--Jet's life as a cop, and Spike's membership in a crime syndicate--while they meet up with others who become a part of their crew. Faye Valentine's a selfish but beautiful gal who occasionally works with the guys\
          \
        when not gambling or trying to understand the memories of her past that have gone missing. Ed's a she that looks like a he that can hack into any computer system, providing she doesn't giggle and goofytalk her way into oblivion. And Ein's a good-natured data dog with as much personality as his companions in just a simple woof. A ragtag bunch if we've ever seen one, the five nevertheless wind up capturing the imagination and hearts of their audience easily during their 26 episodes of adventures.\
I have never seen an animated television series look so fantastic. Almost every episode of Bebop rivals theatrical animation, trouncing on OVAs that supposedly have better budgets. It looks amazing. The soundtrack by Yoko Kanno, a jazz fusion blend, is immediately catchy, but it has surprising depth, enough that the CD has become a regular companion. If you like animation at all, you'll have to see Bebop. And, frankly, it doesn't matter if you are a subtitle purist or a dub fan, because both versions are fantastic. I watch subs almost exclusively, and I got hooked on the dub. That just doesn't happen to me, but it did here. It's that good.\
But beyond that, the show has a style and colorfulness lacking in too many anime. True, some shows like Hellsing are drenched in style, but that's all they are. Cowboy Bebop is cool without ever having to rely on attitude alone to see it through. Although I tend to prefer shows with plotlines that build on each other, Bebop grows our affection for the characters through mostly stand-alone episodes. There is back-story to be told, and it's told well, but rarely do shows without a strong story arch feel so natural. It shouldn't be as powerful as it is, but it's a testament to good storytelling.\
Then there's that wonderful history and the drastic ending (which I won't spoil here, though I'll discuss it below under the main review). I'm reminded when watching Cowboy Bebop of the tagline from the beautifully haunting film Magnolia: \"We may be through with the past, but the past isn't through with us.\" Bebop is effective because each character has such a rich history before the stories here even begin that they are fully realized in every way. Sadly, in most anime, characters exist only to fulfill plot purposes, rather than existing as entities unto themselves. In fact, Bebop works because we go through the entire show, right up to its conclusion, without knowing everything there is to know about these folks. They are motivated by issues that the writers developed that we don't even fully understand. That lends a reality to the characters that makes them far more enjoyable than we expect. When their pasts catch up with them, we care.\
This leads us to the controversial part...the last few episodes that wrap everything up. The events of those episodes are cataclysmic, to say the least. For American audiences, they can mar the experience, even. (As one friend said to me, \"Now that I've watched the whole thing, the last couple episodes make me sad, in a way, that I did.\") But they are very Japanese, encapsulating the ambiguity and realism that set the very best anime apart. I believe that they make the show even more authentic and worthy. At the same time, the only thing that keeps me from giving the show an A+ is that the ending doesn't have the emotional impact it should because we just don't know quite enough back-story yet for it to work. We are left with too many questions. Again, I attribute it to the fact that Japanese stories are rife with ambiguity. But this one could have stood just a little bit less.\
That being said, Cowboy Bebop is easily in my list of \"best anime ever\". If you like anime, you should see it. Period. Normally, I use my final paragraph to sum it all up, but that says it all. You should see it.\

    Overview:\
As one of the most famous anime of the 1990's, \"Cowboy Bebop\" is a show that needs no introduction. With that in mind, there is almost no need to write this review other than to state my own personal opinion. With its smooth, detailed animation, highly unique music style, awesome action scenes, flawless voice acting and quirky yet lovable characters, \"Cowboy Bebop\" is a brilliant crime fiction/space western series that deservedly became an instant classic.\
Story & World (8.5/10):\
The series takes place in the year 2071, roughly sixty years after an accident with a hyperspace gateway made the Earth uninhabitable. Because of this incident, humanity has\
          \
        colonized most of the rocky planets and moons of the Solar System. Amid a rising crime rate, the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) set up a legalized contract system, in which registered bounty hunters (also referred to as \"Cowboys\") chase criminals and bring them in alive in return for a reward. The crew of the titular spaceship Bebop are a group of such bounty hunters. Originally, the crew consists only of our main character, Spike Spiegel and his partner Jet Black, but with the first nine episodes, three new members join the crew. The series has a largely episodic nature that follows this group of misfits hunting down criminals while also covering their day-to-day lives.\
One thing you'll notice is that the crew hardly ever get the bounties, often screwing things up by ultimately killing the person or having something else happen. Unfortunately, as you can guess, this can get a bit repetitive, as you begin to expect that they'll end up risking their lives and get absolutely nothing for their trouble. Now and again, however, the show does see them capturing bounties alive, just to show that they're actually good at what they do. And when I say 'a bit repetitive', I mean 'a bit', as the episodes have a wide variety of genres, including film noir, gothic horror, creature-feature, black comedy, screwball comedy, spy action, tragedy, action, philosophy, science, spirituality, buddy-buddy stories, parody and everything in between. One episode might be extremely funny while the next could be highly bleak or unsettling. \
Largely, however, the show doesn't really have a story. While there is two story arcs, they only really come in when needed and often go several episodes without being touched upon. I felt that Spike's arc, which focuses on his past as a criminal, was quite underdeveloped as a lot of things aren't really made clear. Thankfully, I can say that the ending of the series as a whole is absolutely fantastic.\
Art & Animation (9/10):\
\"Cowboy Bebop\"'s animation is extremely smooth. While there are better-looking anime out there, the fights are brilliantly choreographed and, for a hand-drawn series, the characters and environments are all incredibly detailed, with everyone and everything having a distinct appearance. All of this creates a fantastic-looking anime that still holds up even to this day. Considering the show first aired in the late 90s, that is quite an accomplishment.\
Sound & Dialogue (10/10):\
My God, the music is absolutely fantastic! It is a very unique style that really fits the tone of the series. I cannot think of a single other anime that uses jazz music, and it's used to full effect here. There is only one opening and one ending theme ('Tank!' and 'The Real Folk Blues', respectively) but they are both two of the best themes for an anime I have ever seen. The voice acting is just as good, with the English dub being known for one-upping the Japanese original. I especially like Steven Blum and Wendee Lee's performances as Spike and Faye, respectively. The former has a really cool voice which really fits Spike's laid-back personality and the latter pulls off Faye's feminine charming perfectly. The script is great as well, largely thanks to Spike's brilliant snarky quips.\
Characters (9/10):\
The Bebop crew can be summed up as follows- the grumpy, sarcastic guy (Spike), the femme fatale (Faye), the wise mentor (Jet), the dog (Ein) and the kid (Ed, who is a girl, btw). However, there is far, far more to them than just that. Spike is a former criminal haunted by the lost of a loved one, Faye is an amnesiac con artist, Jet is a former cop with a robot arm and acts as Spike's foil, Ein is a lab experiment to create a very intelligent dog and Ed is an expert hacker with a... very odd thought pattern.\
All of the Bebop crew have their moments in the sun, with various episodes focusing on a specific member. Spike's past catches up to him and he forced to face off against his former best friend-turned-enemy Vicious (more on him later), Faye attempts to recover her lost memory and Jet is forced to deal with various issues from his past as a cop. Ed and Ein don't get as much focus as the core trio, and the episodes that focus on them tend to be very comical.\
All of the Bebop crew are lovable in their own ways, but Spike and Faye are by far the most developed. Ed and Ein remain pretty much the same throughout the entire series and while Jet goes through several instances of cleaning up his own past, it doesn't really affect his outlook and lifestyle, with him still being the same gruff but gentle giant. Spike and Faye, on the other hand, are the focus of the major story arcs of the series, with Spike looking for his lost love and settling his score with Vicious and Faye attempting to recover her memory and find her place in the universe. While they remain rather grumpy and unpleasant even to the end, they do definitely care for each other and their shipmates. Plus, they (along with Jet) can more than hold their own in a fight.\
This brings us to the main villain, Vicious, a ruthless crime lord who most certainly lives up to his name, as he is notorious for betraying anybody even remotely close to him. He also has legendary skill with a katana, to the point that he manages to make a sword vs. gun fight between him and Spike seem fair, albeit with a bit of cheating on his part. He appears in a total of five episodes and is the only recurring antagonist in the series. That said, some other villains do leave lasting impression even though they only appear in one episode. That is very difficult to do. \
Enjoyment (9.5/10):\
Due to the variety in the episodes, you are unlikely to ever be bored while watching \"Cowboy Bebop\". Even if you aren't a big fan of anime, you can still really enjoy this series due to it being largely Western-styled. Some of the episodes, however, especially the last four, are very unsettling and may put off some people. Others, on the other hand, are incredibly funny, so essentially there's something here for everyone.\
Overall:\
The fact that \"Cowboy Bebop\" is just as popular today as it was when it first aired nearly twenty years ago easily cements its status as a timeless classic, and, having watched it myself, I can easily see why. Fluid animation, awesome music and memorable characters make this one of my favourite anime thus far. If, by any chance, you haven't watched this series, I would recommend you do so as soon as possible.\

    Overlooked classic I never watched lived up to it's fame and a OST I fell in love with.\
Story: Bounty Hunters in space, while this isn't something that has been touched in fiction before I feel it does it the best. At times it's vague, which it doesn't need to be detailed with certain characters past not being completely explained till later adds to the mystery of some of them and the over all events that lead them meeting each came together pretty well. Had the right amount of comic relief and tension not many shows I feel do it this well no over zealous comedy\
          \
        and it was serious when it needed to be.\
Art: For it's time the art is top notch, the environments are well designed, characters aren't all copy-pasted templates they are unique looking. Gives a nice mixture of the wild west, and space mashed together.\
Sound: I loved the OST so much I ended up getting it for myself. I'm a fan of jazz, and Cowboy Bebop does it well. The opening song is pretty spicey and smooth got to say it's one of my favorite Opening OSTs to date. Tank, Rush, Space Lion, etc never get's old listening to them.\
Characters: The main characters work well together, from the chaos to the sad moments it feels like one of the better choices for bunching them together. Even a lot of side characters weren't dull and many times I was wishing I would see some again. \
Probably the best space bounty anime there is, and it left me wanting a little bit more feeling it ended to quickly. \

    Where to start on this one?  Putting aside all jokes and the renown the show has Cowboy Bebop is not an easy reviewed title.  \
If you've been a fan of anime for a while there's a good chance you already know what I am about to say.  Cowboy Bebop is great, and if you have not tried it yet I'd recommend at least going through it once.  \
STORY and THEMES\
The story to Cowboy Bebop is rather straight forward at first glance.  You simply follow the lives, of at the start two bounty hunters.  But eventually what seems like a\
          \
        straight forward story will eventually unwind into a more complex commentary on many common and uncommon themes, while never abusing the main story.  Whether its the display and contemplation of immortality in Episode 6, or the themes of friendship and betrayal in the 2 Episodes of Jupiter Jazz, you can tell that there is more than just a simple love/revenge story.  You can get something out of every episode and I think that helps the show stand out as a whole.  With its episodic formula of following different stories in each new episode (Discounting Jupiter Jazz, and The Real Folk Blues) many may be turned off.  But the fact that they use these stories to teach something or add to the experience, makes the system  not only work, but become ideal for the show.  \
SETTING/SOUND/ART\
The setting is honestly one of the best I've ever come across in an anime.  The pseudoscience and spaceship designs make any astrophysics nerds (Such as myself) already love the show right off the bat.  The perfect blend of early 20th century wild west themes and a sci-fi setting help set the show apart from any other.   The sound is amazing, it has one of the best sound tracks I've ever heard.  I think this is most prominent in the last few episodes especially the song jazz rock song \"Real Folk Blues\".  The art is godly.  While being an older anime some characters may look off or slightly disproportionate the scenic scenes are drawn with such detail its awe inspiring.\
CHARACTERS \
The character development in this show is amazing.  Without giving too much away it is obvious you can see characters develop and start caring for one another.  And when a character is in peril you feel like there's something at risk.  Combine all this with good comedy from each character and you get a lovely cast of characters that becomes very likable later in the show.\
TD;LR  If you haven't already give this one a watch, you should.   I promise it won't disappoint.  Everyone has their own taste, and Bebop knows this it has something for everyone in the show, and I personally love the show.  I watched it subbed, but the dubbed is adequate.  Just give it a watch, it won't disappoint\

    Cowboy Bebop. Just this name will make anime haters cower in fear. Cowboy Bebop is one of these show you can call a \"classic\", something that transcends time and space, and, even after 16 years, be one of the best anime of all time.  \
Let's jam !\
Story 9/10\
Cowboy Bebop could be described as an episodic show, where all the episodes are standalones. But  this isn't really accurate. Some episodes, such as the fifth and last one, follow a linear story, and the \"standalone\" ones are mostly here to develop the characters and setting, in a brilliant way. Each one of these episodes is\
          \
        a little gem of its own, and deserves to be appreciated. \
Art 10/10\
This show is just... amazing. When you consider that Bebop was one of the last big animes not using digital animation, and it is still beautifully animated, even by today's standards, well... That alone says it all.\
Sound 10/10\
People, this is Yoko Kanno. What did you expect ? For those who don't know who Yoko Kanno is, you'll discover it soon enough. Cowboy Bebop just lives for music. If you took out the action and space setting, all you'd find would be music. Everything, from the episode names to some characters, everything is a musical easter egg. Therefore, the soundtrack of this show is undoubtedly one of the best I've ever heard, from the amazing opening to the wonderful ending.\
Characters 9/10\
What can be said about the characters ? They're just so great. Their development is one of the best I've ever seen, being subtle yet amazing, hinted yet memorable. The three main characters, Spike, Faye and Jet are all different, and awfully realistic. They are understandable and lovable. On the other hand, the secondary characters, which you usually only see for an episode or two are also outstanding. In only 20 minutes, you get to know them as well as the main cast, while still having the plot go on.\
But, as many things go, there is a flaw. And this flaw is Ed. I have to confess, I've never seen a main character so empty since the first season of Aldnoah; Zero. If Ed had not been there, the characters would have deserved a 10. But don't worry, this doesn't kill any of the enjoyment, because Ed is mostly here for comical relief, and does its job well.\
Enjoyment 10/10\
While some people describe Cowboy Bebop as slow, which killed the enjoyment, I have to disagree. After all, it is an episodic show for the most part, and the pacing \"suffers\" from it. But nevertheless, I hugely enjoyed watching Cowboy Bebop, and loved every minute of it.\
Overall 10/10\
There are many shows whose dream is to become the perfect anime, sometime being close to achieving it, sometimes not. But Bebop must be one of the closest one to perfection. \
I highly recommend you to watch this anime, even at the price of your own life. Because bebop isn't your random anime. It's one of the few shows who can pretend to be called a finished work of art. \
If you enjoyed ( or not) reading this review, don't hesitate to send me a message to discuss this wonderful anime.\
See you, space cowboy ! \

    Cowboy Bebop is the like the Firefly of anime. \
Although an older animation it still is consistently counted as one of the best anime's of all time and rightly so. A great story with some amazing characters make this a highly enjoyable anime.\
The story is fantastic with a combination of mystery and action, however the pacing is odd at times and it feels like you are just watching filler episodes which at times can make it boring, but the baseline story remains strong and finishes it off well. \
The art although old fits well with the world that it is set in, everything looks dirty\
          \
        and authentic. Old animation tends to turn people away form Bebop but after the first few episodes you grow into it.\
The sound and voice recoding is not up to standard however with poor sound effects and sometimes awkward voice acting can make you cringe. The music of Bebop is fantastic, a brilliant opening theme really sets the mood for the upcoming episode.\
The characters are the heart and soul of Bebop and make the show what it is. All the characters feel unique and have there own detailed back stories which give them depth. You really start to love them and by the end you don't want to say goodbye.\
Overall this is a thoroughly enjoyable anime and I would recommend it to any fans of Joss Whedon's Firefly. A must see for any anime lover old or new.\

Overall, very enjoyable show. I’d definitely recommend it to people that haven’t watched it before. I won’t go so far as to say it was a masterpiece; Overall , it was very good with some great moments/aspects sprinkled in to make it worth the watch.\
I felt like I grew attached the the crew characters stories and loved their interactions with each other. Its difficult to describe more, other than that (at least in the dub version I watched) their interactions with each other flow extremely well every scene they're in. I\
          \
        liked the fact that Spike meets so many different kinds of people throughout the anime.\
I think this anime’s best points were its variety in terms of episodes, and also its excellent atmospheres and ESPECIALLY the great musical scores and how they were incorporated with specific animated sequences. The sheer amount of varied characters, personality wise and appearance wise, was especially cool.\
The “main\" story-line was only a few episodes, the story there was pretty interesting and fun to watch but honestly nothing revolutionary. Same with the episodes that focused on the background of the crew members. The other mini stories presented were usually pretty fun and/or quite interesting to watch but sometimes weren’t that enticing.\
My favorite episode was probably Ballad of Fallen Angels, I liked it more than Jupiter Jazz 1 and 2, and I think it just ever so slightly edges out The Real Folk Blues 1 and 2. Other than that I really like the VCR tape episode for its unexpected very well executed ending minutes.\
\
I liked the fact that this show had silly episodes where you could just kick back and enjoy the antics that the crew got themselves into, and at the same time having those serious episodes sprinkled in that really hit home in a good way. Even in some of the silly episodes it was really cool to see some things that have deeper meaning, or you find elements in them that hit you in the feels.\
\
The most glaring negative aspect of this anime that some of the episodes seemed to be rather boring to me. But these were generally few and far between. Well that and what I mentioned before, the main plot isn't super exciting. I'll also say that the main character's backgrounds are really not explored to a very satisfying level, its not that the characters don't feel fleshed out in the show, it's just that I would have really appreciated more in depth back story about all of them to make me care about them more.\
Ultimately , Cowboy Bebop is a damn good, solidly enjoyable, and unique experience that I think every anime fan really should have on their watched list. \

    ** This review is not polished. Please don't bother reading this.**\
Constructive criticism is welcome via PM or comment. All appreciated. \
I hate episodic animes. I hate them so much to a point where I break my keyboard whenever I'm watching one. Cowboy Bebop is no exception. I hated it. I hated it so much to a point that I loved it. I don't know if that makes sense but that's how I feel about this masterpiece. \
\
STORY (Concept 4.5/5, Development 4.5/5)\
The concept is rather cliche. Future technology in combination with the Big Wild West and Jazzy feel. \
This doesn't mean it is not good. History\
          \
        shows how copying good stuff is always good. And the idea of \"Space Cowboy\" is simply cool and awesome. \
By definition, filler episodes are episodes that are just there without any connection to the purpose of the anime. What makes cowboy bebop amazing is that its fillers have purposes. \
As a person who greatly criticizes on Black Butler and Darker than Black's episodic storyline, I cannot do the same to Cowboy. \
Unlike Black Butler, every little episodes in Cowboy is extremely interesting, which means, NOT boring. In Cowboy most if not all episodes stand strong on their own, so the connections they have with the main plot are clear and meaningful. \
Unlike Darker than Black, the main characters of the show stays as the main characters. So all arcs have Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed as the center of the plot. \
All the characters have their own episodes. These episodes are scatters all over the place so we the viewers can change the flavor once in a while.  \
My main problem with the show is that, I don't have the motivation to go to the next episodes... I guess that's just me. \
The ending is awesome.\
All in all, this is how you do episodic show. I respect it despite the fact I don't like episodic show. They deserve the credit of making all the episodes interesting. \
\
CHARACTERS (Design 5/5, Development 5/5)\
As I said previously, all the characters have their own background and development. \
The Bebop Crew consists of Spike the Cowboy, Faye the hotty, Jet the daddy, Ed the kid and Ein the dog. \
Spike is probably the most interesting cowboy in all of existence. For a lack of better term, he is a serious person, yet a troll. He is super positive, he is a likable person who is supposed to be the \"Bang\" on the ship. He died once, which adds layers and layers of mystery on top of this badass cowboy. As the show unfolds, his past is resolved...\
Faye and Jet are also very interesting. Like spike, they find Bebop their new home and abandoned their past. Unlike Spike, they are truly able to abandon their history and reborn. Spike is different from the rest of the crew because he cannot run away, or he choose to not run away. \
Ed doesn't really have any personally background. She is a fun little character that infuses herself with the Bebop. She has her place in the show and I think the way they present it is great.\
Ein is the best dog in the history of humanity. Period. \
\
GRAPHIC (Art 5/5 Animation 5/5)\
The art is godlike. They are so gorgeous. The space scenes and the different planets are mind blowing. Characters are also very well designed. \
Let's just put it this way so people would not run away because \"old animations suck\". \
Cowboy Bebop has 1998 animation that is better than the majority of the 2018 animations. The pictures are literally drawn BY HAND, FRAME BY FRAME. I could not believe my eyes when I stepped in to the episode. They are simply so smooth and detailed. The only time when you would see something that's recycled is when the spaceships take off. Action scenes are awesome. \
The only thing I can say that is not appealing is that I watched a 4:3 series on a 16/9 screen. :/\
\
SOUND (OP/ED 3/3, OST 3/3 Audio 4/4)\
Not gonna explain the OP and the ED, go listen yourself. They are on youtube. (they are fantastic) \
OST. So much emotions. So much feels. I would say one can only hate it if he/she hates jazz. Who hates jazz? \
The dub. This is one of the first GOOD dubs made by the Americans. I think even the dub haters should at least respect the work. That said, the Original audio has great feels and tones as well. \
However, the stage of the show is in this multi cultural space. All sorts of people from different nationalities tag alone. I don't know about the Japanese version but the English does have great accent and it just feels right that a cowboy speaks English, isn't it? \
\
ENJOYMENT (9/10)\
I loved the series. It is definitely in my top 3 if not top 1. But there were times during the show that I felt bored :/ \
The beginning was not that good either. Well comparing to the rest of the series at least. \
And yea, I still don't like episodic anime. \
I never cried for any show. But if I need to cry for a show, it's gotta be the ending of Bebop or Steins;Gate. (no i haven't watched clannad and Brotherhood yet) \
\
OVERALL (10/10)\
See You Space Cowboy. \
Peace. \

    Hey there space cowboy/girl!!\
\
Today I’ll be reviewing Cowboy Bebop. It wasn’t that long ago that I was sceptical with the quality an anime from the 90’s could produce. Of course my doubts were put to bed with the likes of Neon Genesis Evangelion.\
\
So the story revolves around Spike a bounty hunter who travels around on a spaceship called ‘Bebop’ with his partner Jet who owns the ship. Together the two go around looking for bounty heads to cash in on, though more often then not failing to succeed. Along the way we have the addition of Faye and Radical Edward who join in\
          \
        on the shenanigans.\
\
Don’t let the brief above fool you into thinking this is a happy-go-lucky bounty hunt full of comical failures. Oh no, you are in for a much better surprise than that. Cowboy Bebop has a good thing going, it has its priorities set straight from the get go and builds on it for the continuation of the series. The main characters get a great deal of screen time and have entire episodes dedicated for their back stories which few shows do now-a-days.\
\
Let’s turn our attention to the characters. Now I’m not going to go out of my way to hail the cast of Cowboy bebop ‘’AMAZING’ but the characters are very enjoyable. Spike is a old fashioned bad-ass, he always seem to get the job done in the end, but not with ease as the show portrays his flaws and the effort he has to put in so that things go his way. Spike is simply that cool guy you wanted to be in high school and not because he was a douche bag who bullied guys and skipped class to smoke, but because he is an all-round honourable and respectable man. Next is Jet he is that authority figure he is short tempered and very grumpy, but inside he’s just a softie. He is a likeable character and usually does the right thing. His story arc wasn’t that favourable to the other characters, but I still liked Jet as a whole. Next up is Faye. She takes the role of a femme-fatale. She is bitchy, hot-headed and a compulsive gambler. On top of that her memories were forgotten while she was in cryogenic freezing. Giving her story arc the annoying “I NEED TO KNOW WHO I AM. Kind of story arc which is annoying. Faye does however have her moments and I liked her. Finally we have Ed. She came along later in the series as the geeky, hyperactive computer hacker who doesn’t know any better. Ed is that bit of comic relief on the side. She lightens the tone and occasionally will give you a chuckle because she is just adorable.\
\
The art in the series is great for its time, in comparison to today’s standards it is appalling but again it came out in the late 90’s so you can’t really fault the show. The sound is very jazzy, well that’s what I gathered from the opening and it continues throughout the show as it fits in with the western tone of the series.\
\
Enjoyment, this plays a great part in this show as whether you enjoy the cowboy themes will be a contributing factor on whether the series does it for you or not. I found this to be very enjoyable the action scenes were fluent and exciting. The sci-fi elements also make it a good watch for fans of that genre, it does appeal to a relatively large audience. Those who don’t enjoy the series probably prefer the romance or magical girl/fantasy genre. Most people will find something to enjoy about the series\
\
Overall Cowboy Bebop was a fun ride I thoroughly enjoyed the series and although not every episode was spectacular there are things to give merit for. I’d also like to point out the ridiculously spontaneous episode 11. For those old fashioned, wannabe cowboys this is a must watch. Overall the series was an 8/10 and gets a definite recommendation from me.\

    Unlike some anime shows, this one does not grip you at the start, and some of the best/most interesting characters do not come in until a lot later.  The animation is slightly dated, and there are few special effects such as we are used to now.  The \"futuristic\" world shown is perhaps more reliant on spaceships, space travel, and successful colonization of neighbouring planets than is realistic.  However, despite these flaws, Cowboy Bebop remains an overall entertaining, engaging and, somewhat surprisingly, a moving show.\
Great things about this show - the characters - they do have personality, annoyingly we never see the full\
          \
        depth of some of the characters, even by the end of the show there are still some mysteries that are never solved.  The people in the show give a good idea of the feeling and setting of the show, a series of run-down, rather sorry worlds after the almost ultimate demise of the first.  \
The animation, as I said earlier, lacks special effects, particularly in the space-scenes, that we are accustomed to seeing in the 21st century, however the actual character designs are somewhat wacky and goofy at first - but ultimately, wonderful.  The unrealistically long legs and odd, long movements of the people in the show characterize its style, and somehow help to define the people in the show.  In particular the unrealistically wobbly arms of Ed (a character who arrives a little bit later) give us a good idea of his/her carefree, wacky, young, \"wobbly\" personality.\
Some of the episodes, especially considering those nearer the end, feel a great deal like filler episodes, but almost every one is worth watching for the build-up to the last few, plus the film which came after this series and happens at some point \"between\" two of the episodes.  Most of the episodes in the beginning and middle give us little snippets of the characters' backgrounds and the plot which comes into play later on (most of the episodes are basically separate storylines).  \
The music is also a highlight of the show, most of being composed by Yoko Kanno, famous for her diverse anime soundtracks.  Well, the variety and depth of music in Cowboy Bebop should not disappoint.  Some of it is country/folk music, fitting the Western theme of the series (COWBOY), but that which is not, is less expected and is fitting to whatever mood the show is trying to portray.\
I thoroughly recommend Cowboy Bebop, even if, on the surface, it does not appear to be your sort of anime show.  The kind of anime I generally watch does not fall into many, if any, of Cowboy Bebop's categories (e.g Ao No Exorcist, Blood Lad, Persona 4: The Animation), but I have absolutely no regrets whatsoever after watching a show of this nature.  Trust me, even if it is not your sort of thing, you'll have to admit, even if after watching only one episode, that Cowboy Bebop has its merits.\

    Bebop is one of the best animes of all time. Loaded with action, comedy, drama, romance, all in a sci-fi setting; it is a classic. Best english dub ever... I don't think I've ever seen an entire episode in Japanese.\
Memorable characters. Spike is my favorite anime character of all time; my Spike Spiegel Messenger Bag might just be one of the best purchases I've ever made.\
Awesome music. I listen to the soundtrack every single day. The jazz is amazing, as only Yoko Kanno and The Seatbelts could make such a spectacle. It's the main reason for my favorite radio station being CD101.9\

    Cowboy Bebop directed by Shinchiro Watanabe is one of, if not the best anime that has ever been made. You can call it unoriginal, predictable and you can say that the story is too rigid. The thing is, no other anime has done something like this with so much style and finesse. \
When I decided to write this review the best thing I could compare it to for me, was the video game The Last of Us, one of the most critically acclaimed and best games of all time. The story, the writing, the characters all kinda cliche, but what it does is perfect it\
          \
        like no other work in the medium has. But saying this, the last of us has been out for a year and who knows when it will be beaten. Bebop has lasted for over fifteen years as the most beautiful and artistically, for the lack of better words, 'nailed it'. I emplore anyone who loves anime to watch this before they die, because no one has or will recreated the magic of Bebop.\

    Cowboy Bebop: Spoiler free review\
A truly surreal expirence to be had, Cowboy Bebop blends copious and subtle amounts of almost every genre.\
A picturesque expirence teeming with euphoria and a wonderful sense of adventure. The world is uniquley crafted\
and truly feels like its own.\
Story 7/10 Cowboy bebop has an interesting concept of potraying it's story.\
Being an episodic adventure, sure each episode has a different plot, but intertwined is segments from the character's pasts, taking us into the present to be projected into the future.\
There is very little and a lot going on all at once spanned over this 26 episodic escapade!\
Simply put; we start in the\
          \
        present, slowly unveil the past, and follow the characters into their future.\
Characters 7.5/10 Cowboy Bebop is more character interaction than character\
development, and the interactions are well composed. The main characters have a lot of major differences,\
but that is not to say they fit well together. They bring out the best and worst of\
one another, which makes for some pleasantly awesome scenarios. Although progression isn't a main\
focus, it is sometimes brought to the foreground through; learning who a character once was or what they were like\
and who they are now, or are becoming. Cowboy Bebop has a unique way of unfolding their awesome cast of characters.\
Art Direction 8/10 Most modern day animes by comparison still don't do what Cowboy Bebop did in 1998!\
Action scenes are crisp and fluid, colors are done in a nice gritty finnese for the most part. Artsy\
moments ranging from vibrant with color, to the serene and subtle and moments with artistic pizazz!.\
Music 10/10 If you're familiar with Yoko Kanno(the composer) you have already come to know her exceptional\
quality. This soundtrack is truly outstanding. Contemporary jazz, up-beat techno, surreal musical compositions\
truly every genre can be found here. For 26 episodes there is a WIDE array\
of tracks to be heard, and even American tracks from some well-known artists! The music brings the art direction\
and whole feel of cowboy bebop alive, overflowing with a truly genuine effort to combine with the anime and bring\
it to its peak. Every song fits every moment it is cast into, without being forced.\
\
Cowboy Bebop will capture the attention of almost any anime fan, whether they are looking for action, adventure, sci-fi, even some casual\
slice of life elements. Each episode is written by a different individual, but there is an overall sense of\
direction. Overall I give Cowboy Bebop a 8/10\
Disclaimer: Some episodes can have a dramatically different feel, and I found some episodes to be personally slow.\
Do not let this deter you from missing out on an overall great anime!\
PS: If you found it helpful, or not helpful please, I implore you to contact me via message or comment!\
I'm really looking for critique and want to hear from the anime fans themselves! Thankyou, so much ^_^\

    What did I think of Cowboy bebop... WELL down right one of my favorite anime's because of its outstanding work on adventure comedy and plots through each episode that always kept me entertained. When i first heard about the anime and its accusations of being one of the best anime's ever by some reviews I was curious about it, what brought me closer is that it was made around the time I myself was born.As I  saw this the plots of each different episode were always there keeping me watching it from begging to end with its awesome music (intro and outro)  written\
          \
        by Yoko Kanno and performed by the Seatbelts that always had me hyped and so into it. I loved most every aspect of it and would recommend this amazing anime to any searching for a fun comedy, a badass sci fi, or some mystery type deal with a dramatic past. This anime deserves a 10 out of 10 (especially since it was made in 1998) \

    Warning :Minor Spoilers ahead\
Ok, it's been a while since i saw this anime in top 30 anime list. Looking at the year it was aired I wasn't really interested to watch it. But after some friends recommend it to me and after I read sooo many reviews that give ten to Cowboy Bebop, I decided to watch it. At that time I was tired of animes that show too much moe, ecchi, and other stuff and I'll try the claasic ones. And.. It was..\
Story : (7/10)\
Ok, it has very interesting setting, a futuristic world where people have started living in other planets. Our MCs here,\
          \
        are bounty hunters who have their own unique past. Interesting setting right? Unfortunately, the execution of the story can't deliver it to the audience very well. Cowboy Bebop is  too episodic which almost each episode has each own story. And from this episodic episodes, huge conflicts are only in 5 episodes or something ( if I remember it correctly). I wouldn't mind if other episodes are exciting, but most of it are flat and seems useless. You can even throw some episodes away and it doesn't affect the main story. Watching Cowboy Bebop makes me tired of waiting about Spike's past and what will happen to him and Vicious. I have to watch some uninteresting and some useless episodes before i got to see it. It makes me bored. well, but Spike's story was amazing so I think it's worth waiting.   \
Art : (8/10)\
Art is very good. I like the character designs. Animation was amazing and makes me wonder if it really was made in 90's.\
Sound : (8/10)\
Nice OST\
Enjoyment : (7/10)\
Like I said before, it is hard to enjoy Bebop because some episodes seem useless and feel like filler. Some episodes are just plain and don't excite me. I can really enjoy only a few episodes.\
Overall : (7/10)\
Overall, 7. It was interesting, but it wasn't exciting. Main concept is very good, but too many plain episodes. Maybe because it's classic, some rate it very high (mostly 10). But I don't want too rate it according to the time it was made. I won't divide anime between classic or not. I was also confused to rate it whether 7 or 8. I chose 7 finally. I think it deserves 8. But to me, 8.83 seems little overrated. But well, for those retro anime fans, I'm sorry. People have different opinion sometimes, right?  \

    Overview-10/10\
The story of Cowboy Bebop is the misadventures of a group of space cowboys/bounty hunters with a rift of humor, drama, adventure, action and sci-fi that blend together well with old-time jazz backtracks. From the genius of Shinichiro Watanabe was where this space adventure sprang from and it is an old gem I will always love! And the end is a cliffhanger, leaving you wondering what happened\
Art-10/10\
Watanabe puts some great thought into the appearance of his charachters. They are intricatey designed to fit their persona. Spike Spiegel, our cool-as-ice, sharply dressed hero had a great design with tones of blue and yellow. Perfect compliment!\
Sound-9/10\
The voice\
          \
        actors in the dub (which I usually watch to get a clear picture in my head for my fanfics) are perfect, for the most part. Steve Blum, one of my all time fave voice actors, plays Spike Spiegel, and Wendee Lee plays the sexy and daring Faye Valentine. Their voices are well-suited. The jazzy backing music made for a mysterious and mellow environment, as well as spazzy chase scenes. The ending theme, the real folk blues\
Charachters-10/10\
The charachters are intricate and have very good backstories, be they major or one timers. Spike's romance with a beautiful blonde and rivalry with an old comerade are riveting to watch.\
\
Parental Warnings\
Violence-Strong\
There are brutal shootings, combat, and fistfights strewn throughout, but nothing too terribly gory.\
Language-Moderate\
Swearing here and there, but nothing much\
Sex/Nudity-Mild\
There are a few sex references and jokes, as well as a brief gay love scene\
Frightening/Intense scenes-Moderate\
There is a scene where someone is beat up, as well as several deaths\

    \"I think it's time we blow this scene, get everybody and the stuff together... okay, three, two, one, let's jam!\"\
Out of all the animes I have ever watched in my life, none has ever touched or graced the perfection that is Cowboy Bebop. For a lot of anime fans, including myself, it is probably the greatest anime of all time. It's my favorite anime of all time, but then why is that?\
No, seriously, why? I ask that because the show from a critical point of view, Cowboy Bebop should not be that perfect.\
For one thing, it doesn't follow an actual story. I mean look at\
          \
        we have here: a bunch of bounty hunters on a ship with no real goal other than to collect bounties. Are they trying to accomplish anything big? No, besides one of them is not even an actual bounty hunter but actually an androgynous little girl with excellent hacking skills. That's another thing, Faye only joins because she's a moocher and Ed joins because...(Insert Reason Here) and that's basically it. There is nothing else that these four try to accomplish in their time together.\
...or so they don't think\
You see here's my theory with Cowboy Bebop: The ship is a purgatory. These characters might think they have nothing in common but in reality that's not true. If anything, these characters have one huge big thing in common: They are all not at peace with their inner selves. I guess that's what the beauty of the series is. You are introduced to these characters and discover the kind of people they are and by the end you realize that they have finally discovered what has been plaguing them throughout the whole series leading to a climax that makes you want more but then again is overall a satisfying conclusion to great journey.\
So in other words, while there is no real story to Cowboy Bebop, it's all the individual backstories that connect it all into one amazing tale. Maybe that's why I love Bebop a lot, and on top of this, the show gives us a presentation that is beyond unbelievable.\
Cowboy Bebop's most significant trait is its ability to blend so many western genres into one. In one case, there is one episode that tributes Blaxploitation film and another that is a throwback to classic noir films, and the best part about all this that it's actually done extraordinarily well. Plus, for an anime that was released in 1998, visually it really holds up extremely well. Not only does Cowboy Bebop match its genre visually, but it also does it audio-wise. Yoko Kanno's status as one of the greatest composers in anime really shines here (in fact I believe that is the anime she is really known best for). For one thing, just like director Shinichiro Watanabe, she knows how capture the essence of a episode. For example, when the episode calls for Heavy Metal she goes all out, and so on. \
Voice acting is great in Japanese, but as any anime fan would know, Cowboy Bebop was the first prime example of how American dubbing got it right. In surprising twist, not only does the English track prove the quality of dubs wrong, but it is also the one of those rare times where an anime's English track is superior to Japanese track. You have Steve Blum as Ice-Cool Spike Spiegel, Wendee Lee as the voluptuous Faye Valentine, Beau Billingslea as the gruff yet fatherly Jet Black, and Melissa Fahn as the hyper and playful Edward (which compared to Aoi Tada makes her more likable then creepy). Four talented voice actors who to this day still get praised for their portrayals. I say if there is only one way to watch Bebop then the English track is only way to go.\
So with all this in mind (the surprisingly deep story, the amazing visuals, the pitch-perfect soundtrack, and the absolutely lovable characters), this still doesn't answer the question: what is the one thing that makes Cowboy Bebop, at least to me the pinnacle of anime in general. Well I think if I were to put it simply it would have to be this: It's probably the only anime that actually feels mature when compared to other animes.\
Sure, Cowboy Bebop has some anime conventions going for it: Edward's presence, Faye's physical anatomy, and character's unrealistic hair colors. However, none of this is forced, if anything, it feels kind of real. This is where the show succeeds, for once I am not sickened by Faye's fan-service, again I'm not annoyed by Ed, Jet while the tough guy really has a heart of gold, nothing about this anime feels over-the-top. When it does go over-the-top (and it does), it's handled carefully and doesn't go so far that it feels out of place in the show. That's why I love Cowboy Bebop the most. Let me tell you something: You might be like me with people judging you for watching anime, with me it's hard to sit in public with my computer open with me watching an episode of I don't know High School of the Dead, however, when I'm watching Cowboy Bebop, I don’t mind who’s glancing over. If anything, I would want them to come over and watch.\
My point is I wish more animes were like Cowboy Bebop. That’s not to say I think all animes are bad because they can’t replicate it, definitely not that at all. My point is rather that I wish anime creators understand what Cowboy Bebop does right in terms of catering to certain audiences. Like I said, High School of the Dead may look and be intended for adults, but then there’s the fact that the show bases itself around gratuitous amounts of gore and well…fan-service, catering to specifically the male demographic of around 16-25.\
Overall, Cowboy Bebop is the highest point of animes. It truly is, at least to me, the greatest anime of all time. It does everything that it wants to do right and it makes watching the show over and over again all the more refreshing. Seriously, I can pop in any episode of this show and have the same reaction I had the first time. Shinichiro Watanabe truly has completed a masterpiece and I believe if you are among the people who haven’t watched this show, then I suggest that you go out and watch it immediately. When you’re done, don’t be afraid to share it with people. Show your friends, show your friends who don’t like anime, show your parents, show your siblings, show your English teacher, I DON’T KNOW JUST DO IT! Also, I suggest you do it now, as in buy a copy of the show now because Bandai Entertainment will soon stop distributing this work of art at least to the U.S. market. Support this show and the anime industry anyway. Believe me when I say out of all the animes you will ever watch in your life, I swear that Cowboy Bebop will be the one you will enjoy no matter what. Even if it doesn’t become your favorite anime, I swear that you will feel satisfied that you have watched it at all. Until then, See You Space Cowboy.\

    \"And the work which has become a genre upon itself is called: Cowboy Bebop.\" It's hard not to raise a skeptical eyebrow at the cocksure bravado displayed in the statement, and one might be tempted to proceed with the intent to smash this assertion, as well as the overwhelming praises this show has received, into pieces. \
Except it was entirely justified. \
Sure, Cowboy Bebop is actually a pastiche of genres heavily influenced by classic American films; spaghetti western, space road trip, gangland crime drama, buddy comedy, etc. But through amalgamation of these narrative elements, it has morphed into a unique creation with tremendous amount of\
          \
        polish and flair, consisted of wildly varied bounty-of-the-week episodes and punctuated by  individual character arcs that end up becoming the series' highlights.  \
What the show did with its characters are truly special. They started off as strangers to the audience and to each other (except for Spike and Jet, who are already acquainted in the beginning), only to gradually reveal fascinating layers of personality and history. There's no big drama or obvious bonding scenes between them, but as they bickered, cooperated, and told stories to each other, a subtle  bond is formed throughout the show and I couldn't help but be emotionally invested at their fates. It is through these characters, particularly in the different ways they react to their past demons (*a recurring motif), that the series got the substance to go along with its dazzling style. The writing of the show also made excellent use of symbolism and thematic delivery through subtle means; it's never distracting nor overly obtuse, and it's there to reward those actively looking to unravel more from the narrative.  \
Much has already been said about series director Shinichiro Watanabe, screenwiter Keiko Nobumoto, and composer Yoko Kanno, so I'm pretty much just preaching to the choir here, but I'll say it anyway:  this is one hell of a team, and we're lucky to have them in the anime industry. Th their vision, the world of Bebop is a rich, diverse,cornucopia of colorful characters set against the backdrop of sweet gorgeous music. I'm not a fan of jazz, and normally I don't even pay much attention to a show's given oST unless it's really exceptional or really terrible, but the composition and performance in this show is really something else. The Seatbelts, a multi-national and heavily instrumental band spearheaded by Kanno, contributed an incredible variety and quantity of stuff that became integral in setting the mood, whether it's the extremely iconic instrumental OP in Tank!, the gorgeous wordless vocal in ELM,  the haunting lyric of Call Me to accompany one of the most heart-breaking scenes in any anime, or the somber jazz piece of Space Lion, just to name a few examples from a (very) deep list. \
I couldn't find it in me to give me a perfect score; my enjoyment of the stand-alone episodes are uneven, and the show never really sustained a sense of momentum until the final three episodes. I could also see someone watching this for the first time and find it to not really be that compelling, but it's important to note that Cowboy Bebop really became something special through repeat viewings, where one is more attuned to observe the homages, foreshadowing, and hidden nuggets of information in even the least consequential episode. Bottom line, if you're looking for something with serious entertainment and artistic merits, you owe it to yourself to watch this. Twice, at least.\

    You know how people talk about that movie that is just a \"classic,\" the kind of movie you just /have/ to see at least once in your life? The one that was the /first/ of its kind, the one that started it all?\
For me, that movie was the Godfather. Bare with me here, obviously Bebop is not a mob story (though there are some underground organizations). But like the Godfather it has a very large fanbase of people who praise the movie like it was shit from the anus of Jesus Christ himself and will slit your throat if you so dare to criticize it.\
          \
\
I did not love the Godfather. I didn't understand what was so special about it... it was just like every other mob movie I've ever seen. It was basically a shorter version of the Sopranos with a more satisfying ending. My family of diehard italians wanted to murder me in my sleep after I admitted my apparent lack of taste, but I couldn't help it. \
Now unless you live a very blessed life, you've probably watched one of those classic movies and came away with the same feeling. Maybe it was all of the hype, or maybe it was just because you've seen it done so many times before and can't appreciate the originality. Either way, you watched it and you weren't that impressed.\
Bebop is like the anime version of those classics.\
Personally, I loved Bebop. Which is why I said \"to hell with it\" and gave it a 10 like so many others. That being said, I can definitely see how people may have issues with the show. \
It isn't amazing for everyone, and if you're going to watch it I highly suggest you attempt to disregard all of the hype. The show is a masterpiece for reasons that don't resonate with everyone, and going in with a certain mindset might skew your opinion \
Bebop is basically about a bunch of oddballs living together on a spaceship and occasionally catching bounties (do they ever actually catch one? I can't remember). To put it simply, the show is very episodic. Most people may call it \"all filler,\" but that's sort of the point. \
It isn't one straight narrative with a linear plot. It's not \"going\" anywhere. It's about the everyday life of the characters, and everyday life is pretty random. Especially if you're floating through space on a spaceship with no real aspirations or goals. \
The characters are taking every day one step at a time, and the plot reflects that. And as you learn more about the characters, you come to understand why they have this attitude \
Through the episodes, the characters are more fanned out. This is where the writing really shines. There are moments in this show that are, in my opinion, fucking amazing. (see episode 5 \"Ballad of Falling Angels\" church scene) Moments that make you shout \"holy shit\", and moments that may hit you like a bullet through the heart. The characters are realistic and three dimensional despite the fact you don't really know /that/ much about them, and it's through those (admittedly scarce) moments. \
The rest of the time you just have ministories about different bounties. They're amusing stories (most of the time) and I honestly enjoyed them. But I can definitely understand how this set up isn't for everyone. \
really \
Basically, don't go in with certain expectations. The show isn't for everyone. It is episodic, and what you may consider the \"plot\" only comes up in brief moments. These moments are great, but if you're not the kind of person who enjoys the in between, then you're not going to enjoy the show. \
And there's nothing wrong with not enjoying the show. \
Just like there's nothing wrong with me hating the Godfather. \
Or so I tell my Nonna. \

    Looking for an anime mixed with futuristic bounty hunters and jazz?  Then this one is for you.  Cowboy Bebop is overall, one of my favorite animes ever.  Perhaps you're saying to yourself, the rating is a bit exaggerated.  But this is not the case, allow me to explain myself.\
Story: A very original, and heart-pounding story.  One that tells a story of love, hate, and overall pure excitement!\
Art: Perhaps not the best of it's time, but certainly among them.  Cowboy Bebop delivers very beautiful artwork, especially with all the images of the future.\
Sound: Both the Japanese and English tracks were\
          \
        filled with great voice acting.  Also the sounds hit dead on perfection.  The interesting part about Cowboy Bebop is it's close relation to the jazz genre.  Much enjoyment of the sound from the brilliant artist Yoko Kanno.\
Character: This was a huge plus for Cowboy Bebop.  The characters showed a very unique aura in their own way.  Matching very well with the atmosphere of Cowboy Bebop.  Spike being the main protagonist, also showing very mixed emotions showing much humor.\
Enjoyment: I very well enjoyed Cowboy Bebop.  Perhaps it was the queer attitude of some characters, or the total hilarious moments.  It's one anime I can watch over and over again, and still enjoy.\
Overall:  Cowboy Bebop is an amazing anime which will hold a place in my heart forever.  Not only did I love it, but it played a big part in my life as well.  It's a great show for people of all ages.  Mixing classic jazz, futuristic bounty hunters, and great fight scenes.  Cowboy Bebop is one anime i would recommend to anyone.\

    This is my First Review! I never watched anime until i took an anime film course last semester and for our research paper we had to choose an anime series. I chose the show Cowboy Bebop as ive heard of its praise, and i was blown away. I was so impressed by the characters, the inner struggles and backstory of Spike, Jet, and Faye and watching them grow and develop was so engaging, the narrative structure was complex and refreshing and it was just so Stylish! from the opening all the way to the end. i wasnt even a fan of jazz until i watched\
          \
        this show, the jazz/blues theme plays through every scenario in the show and compliments the characters and visuals very well. Cowboy bebop so far is the most Complete story ive seen and i am constantly recommending it to people that refuse to watch anime because they say \"its just cartoons\", let them watch this they will be impressed. I am now addicted to anime and have watched a couple of shows since this and im glad i was introduced to a whole new genre of tv and film. By the way you will get hooked on the soundtrack so here are some of the names of the songs you will download.\
Tank - (opening theme)\
Goodnight Julia\
Space lion\
The Real Folk Blues - (end theme)\

    For my anime reviews I am going to review the anime on the order of which you would experience while watching an episode of the anime that is being reviewed.\
1.Art - The first thing that spoke to me from this anime was how good the animation was.  Of coarse it wasn't the best animation but it must have required a huge amount of effort to animate it as well as it was animated.  The series' art was hand-drawn, that means that the animation was and just for that fact you have to respect the artists for this anime and the best part is\
          \
        that the art continues to get better throughout the anime.  The art was spectacular but it isn't quite good enough to get a ten so it will get a 9.\
2.Sound - First I wanna start of by saying the intro is just plain awesome.  They didn't have to make a second intro and they knew well that the first one was to good to be out-shined.  The rest of the soundtrack never bothered me, oh wait YES IT DID.  If I ever hear another horribly composed saxophone solo I am going to shoot myself…. I’m not kidding!  Other than, that the jazz feel really set a smooth mood to the action scenes, I totally dug it.  I can’t give a 10 because of those horrid saxophone solos so i’ll give the sound an 8 but that’s still pretty good.\
3.Character - I don’t think that I will find another series with more lovable characters than Cowboy Bebop.  The characters were very unique and the were all lovable, even some of the people who weren’t main characters were lovable.  There is not much else to say about these characters, they were all unique, lovable, and well-developed and I wish that was how all animus were.  Undisputed 10/10 for characters.\
4.Story - The story….. well….. wow. It was a good story to say the least and \
there wasn’t one instance where I wasn’t enjoying it.  A lot of people thought the ending was amazing but I really failed to see how it was so cool.  It didn’t \
blow me away like it might have intended to but it was very satisfying as an ending and it did leave me with a good feeling.  The story was amazing but for a little disappointment with the ending i’ll give it a 9.\
5.Enjoyement - Well… I enjoyed this show a lot and I can with no doubt call it a classic but I have seen shows that are just as good or even better than this anime.  That being said, this anime made me feel like a bounty hunter and that is what matter the most.  I enjoyed this anime fully and it gets a 10 for enjoyment.\
This anime is an overall 9.\
*I would recommend this anime to a person of any age.\
Caution:\
!Keep in mind this anime has mild gore. \

    Amigo! Believe it or not, I've never seen Cowboy Bebop untill now. Let's see what I have missed.\
Story:\
While there is a plot throughout this anime, it is mostly episodic. That was not what I expected, though I really didn't mind it. After 24 episodes I was sure that the finale could not be all to good, there was just too little build up...but I was wrong. Bebops last two episodes are one of the best endings to an anime I've seen so far. I only wished we could've seen more of the main plot. The standalone episodes mostly delivered, either in a comedic way (most\
          \
        of them) or just as good little stories.\
9/10\
Art:\
Cowboy Bebop was aired in 1998, but the general look feels more like 1988. But unlike many shows of the 80s and early 90s, this one has flawless animation and is generally pleasant to look at. There is very few uses of CGI, but when it's used, it sticks out. I personally don't like that. That's the only real flaw I saw here.\
8/10\
Sound:\
Do I really have to say anything? Even if the voice acting was horrible (it isn't, in fact it's pretty good), the soundtrack is so incredibly good it would still justify 10 points. Jazz, Blues, Country, Pop, Rock, Metal, it has everything and it always fits. I know everybody has their own opinion, but seriously, if you don't like Bebops soundtrack, you are officially deaf.\
10/10\
Characters:\
Spike and Jet are pretty cool guys. I loved watching them, I liked how they thought, talked and acted. Faye on the other hand...let's just say I'm not her biggest fan. I'm not saying she's terrible, but she is not as good a character as the rest of the crew. Ed is an odd case. The thing is, Ed doesn't really add much to the show, except for comedic relief. Usually, those are the characters I like the least. But it is scientifically proven that you can't not like her. The few episodes she had a bigger role in made me want to see more of her. The rest of the cast was somewhere between okay and good. Nobody stood out too much in either direction.\
7/10\
Enjoyment:\
I didn't expect to be blown away by this anime, but it was a very fun ride. I never had to force myself to watch another episode, I actually almost marathoned it (for my watching habits that is). Cowboy Bebop is considered one of the best anime of all time. I don't know if I can agree on that, but I can surely say that it is a very good one. Only thing that would be even better would have been more plot episodes (as stated above).\

    The other day I finished Attack on Titan, and now I finished Cowboy Bebop... two amazing anime, drawn quite differently, yet both powerful in its own way. You want to see an anime that's highly mature, characterized, even philosophical? One of the rare gems whose English dub is perhaps superior to the sub? This is only the second I've seen dubbed, after Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. You want to see a troubled character, and wonder yourself about your purpose in life? Existentialism. Loneliness. The power of silence.\
Cowboy Bebop is episodic -- that is, most of the episodes have their own short stories. But that's to be\
          \
        expected, given the nature of the characters. You can criticize Bebop all you want for this, but hey, an anime's setting and characters produce the plot. Bleach, for example. You could say that it's extremely elongated and contains too much combat, but as practically all of the main characters are fighters (whether Shinigami or not) and Soul Society is protected by squads of fighters, and they fight Hollows and other variations, combat just has to run the show. Bleach can't be as character-focused as Clannad or plot-developed as FMAB. Cowboy Bebop is about bounty hunters, and you can't have a series about just finding one or two bad guys. If you want to reveal more about the bounty hunter life and delve more deeply into the futuristic world, then having the crew go after multiple bounties is just natural. So if you're thrown off by that, I can't blame you, but nevertheless you must try it out. Like Attack on Titan, Bebop performs magnificently with progressive revelation, but this time into the characters' pasts. One of the (many) superb facets of anime is the hidden past of a character. Here the pasts continue to haunt the characters, especially Spike Spiegel, the protagonist. As you watch more and more of Bebop, you see more and more of the main characters' pasts and empathize more with them.\
As I mentioned before, loneliness. Spike is such an awesome character. I mean, I've seen some pretty awesome characters -- Natsu Dragneel, Ichigo Kurosaki, Tomoya Okazaki, Toshiro Hitsugaya, Lelouch, Light Yagami, etc. But Spike just beats them all. Besides his skill in hand-to-hand combat and outwitting his enemies, he is someone so influenced by the past. Take the impact of Simba's past from The Lion King and put it on steroids. Simba had the whole \"you can't change the past\" thing, right? Exactly what happens with Spike. Why is he so nonchalant? Why does he go towards danger so rashly? Not because he's cool (well, that too), but because he has already died to him. I won't explain more, perhaps I've said too much already. He is such a complex person. The character development -- or rather, revelation -- of Spike Spiegel alone gives the characterization in Bebop a 10.\
The art of Bebop is from 1998, so it's quite different from anything more recent. But I think the older styles are better in that they can show more depth, more hue to the setting and characters. The way cigar smoke billows into the air. How flashbacks are tinged with a sad grey. Whenever Spike fights. If Bebop were animated by, say, Bones after the style of FMAB, it would be different. After seeing Bebop, I am more motivated to continue watching Neon Genesis Evangelion, to see more of that art style.\
The opening by The Seatbelts has panache, elan, style. The ending is sorrowful, grey, morose. Take the two of them together and you have the character of Spike -- outwardly easygoing and jaunty, but inwardly conflicted. The soundtrack is jazz, and can range into all the necessary emotions. Heck, the music of Cowboy Bebop has its own Wikipedia page.\
The only reason why I gave Enjoyment a 9 out of 10 is because while I enjoyed each episode, I was not captivated the whole time, that is, I did not rush to finish the show in one run. This is one of those shows that you enjoy more as you watch, and after you finish and come to realize the awesomeness of the series. Up to the last episode, the strings are all pulled together and there is a resolution. It's one of those endings that you may not think you want, but it's the ending necessary for the story.\
In my top 5, without a doubt.\

    What is it about this show that makes it a classic? That makes it a must watch? Is it the refreshingly humanistic, genuine and semi-realistic characters? Or maybe its the jazz and blues infused atmosphere that Watanabe so masterfully pieced together? Perhaps it’s that ending that paradoxically leaves us beyond satisfied but with a hole in our heart? What do I know? I’m just a pretentious nerd with way too much time on my hands.\
Art\
----------------\
Now I was 2 when this anime finished airing so I can’t really compare it to all the anime that came out in the late 90s (Other than Mobile Suit Fighter\
          \
        G Gundam and Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, which imo it looked a lot better than both of those series) because even though I’ve watched quite a bit of anime I’m not too sure when most of them originally aired. The art style like most of Watanabe’s works is always different than the norm, most of the character designs are pretty original in my opinion specifically the main characters and one of the only anime characters who comes to mind that resembles Spike is Mugen, but Samurai Champloo was also directed by Watanabe and follows a very similar style as Cowboy Bebop. Since Cowboy Bebop is following a bounty hunter in space he visits a variety of different planets which usually look distinctly different so you won’t be bored by the background.  When I went through the whole series of Cowboy Bebop I never felt the animation was lacking in any of the action scenes and even though yes it’s been about 16 years since Bebop was finished so animation wise you can’t expect it to stand up to most recent projects with their crazy budgets and new technology. Even when I watched Bebop a couple years ago I felt that it looked a bit more dated but in a good way, I feel that the art style being a bit darker and not very flashy portrayed the blues and jazz vibes Watanabe was trying to give off.\
Sound\
--------\
Alright in my personal opinion Bebop’s got one of the greatest soundtracks to date. I’ve been jamming out to Tank for over 5 years on my phone and it really never gets old. But honestly if you aren’t a fan of blues and jazz you might not like it (I’m not even a big fan of blues and jazz but Bebop is the shit), but throughout the show you’ll probably agree that the majority of the OST is very fitting and maybe even has replay value. BUT WHO GIVES A FUCK ABOUT THE OST WHEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE VOICE ACTING. Now I’ve never heard the Japanese version but the English dub was just too fucking good. Not gonna lie either, I mainly attest this to Steven Blum who did the best performance of his career voicing Spike. Blum’s got one cool ass voice and it’s way too fitting for such a cool ass character like Spike. One negative for me though was Ed’s voice I guess, and it just annoyed the shit out of me from time to time that’s all.\
Story\
-----------\
It’s a space western – Hence the name Cowboy Bebop.  The Cowboy in the title is interpreted to be Spike since he’s a bounty hunter in space and to hunt these bounties he pretty much always needs to be on the move. Then there’s the Bebop part of the title which is literally the ship that Spike and his fellow bounty hunter Jet travel from planet to planet. It pretty much follows an episodic format with each new episode or each new couple of episodes following one of their bounties and usually I feel episodic series just aren’t my thing. But even still I don’t remember any episodes that felt slow or dragged on and this show does eventually let you know that in this episodic space exploration bounty hunting fun there is an underlying linear plot line to boot. I think one of the aspects of this show that separates’ it from other series is the extremely well done execution of our main characters past. Their pasts are like a puzzle and every once in a while a piece of that puzzle is put into place until in the end when we’ve got that finished puzzle.\
Characters\
------------\
Hot damn man, can you really be an active user of this website and not heard of Spike Spiegel already. One of my favorite youtube reviews *cough cough* Gigguk *cough cough* put him at the top of his most epically cool character list. In terms of anime I’d say Spike pretty much has got the Rule of cool d own. He’s a very human main character and shit constantly won’t go his way. His two weapons of choice are his hand-to-hand combat style that mirrors the way Bruce Lee used to fight and his sidearm pistol. I’m not going to try to argue that the main cast has a shit tons of depth but they are damn well entertaining and interesting characters and even though you can classify them as clichés well almost everything is a cliché nowadays. So I don’t think the main cast was really lacking anything but I definitely though the main antagonist was, he was as one dimensional as villains get and I was never too interested in him because all he did was make me think “Why are you fucking doing this? This is almost entirely pointless man” because even though we get some backstory on him that doesn’t really leave him with an underlying motivation for being Spike’s primary antagonist. So what I think Cowboy Bebop is lacking is a well thought out main antagonist that can be more than one dimensional.\
Overall: 9/10\
---------------\
Whenever I think of classics in regards to anime I think Cowboy Bebop, honestly it’s the first thing that comes to mind for me. I’ve always recommended this series to any newcomers to anime because I almost feel that after finishing Cowboy Bebop you’ve finished a rite of passage. It’s not without flaws, I definitely agree but I don’t believe that those flaws weighed it down very heavily at all. So in the end I give Cowboy Bebop a 9/10 overall rating and just want to let you know that I find it damn well one of the most entertaining and enjoyable series I’ve ever watched.\
There’s only ONE way that I could end this review……\

    I normally don't write reviews for anime but I found that I should write one for this one. I was surprised that something with this much age could still be relevant today. I adored the music and the interaction of all the characters. I knew however that though Spike longed to be with Julia it would never happen. Their life together was doomed from the start because something that genuinely doesn't exist in reality and rarely in stories. I enjoyed the crew of Spike, Ed, Ein, Faye, and Jet. I felt that in some way they all needed each other to fight against the boredom\
          \
        of the emptiness of space. They are all searching for meaning in their lives and searching for something that will pull them out of the dullness of life. Just moving on and through life just as bounty hunters of the old west frontier did. \
I watched it because it was recommended to me and I enjoyed it. \

    Cowboy Bebop, hardly more needs to be said. It's a one-of-a-kind show, and a cornerstone of its culture.\
Phenomenal story, excellent characters, scripting, and voice acting, and a uniqueness that sets it apart from everything else. Every detail of this show feels original and real, although it's difficult to qualify, if I'm being honest.\
Cowboy Bebop takes all of that, and wisely uses it to show off their incredibly deep and thorough characters. Each of them is  a fully flushed out and real character that has their own reasons for being where they are. All of the voice acting is phenomenal, showing off the excellent scripting.\
          \
         Each character's backstory is fairly thoroughly explained, the two primary protagonists especially so. This gives the setting an added layer of depth, in my opinion, one that is often forgotten in modern day media. Each character's story is unique and moving in its own way.\
But still, this show takes all that even, and somehow makes it special. It's that indescribable feeling that some shows have, that just make them stand out to you; a fleeting and haunting feeling that passes over as you finish the last episode, because you realize it was always going to end this way, just as the main protagonist realized too. \
The only thing holding this show back from being a 10/10 is the middle of the season, where things get a little stale. Filler took up space where I wanted exposition and story, and while it may have helped to develop the main characters somewhat and served to provide space for production of the real episodes to be fully fleshed out, I think that these fillers didn't add enough to justify their presence. If these episodes were removed or reformatted, and the main story kept more concise, then this show would have easily been a 10/10, and have a spot in my Legends.\
But despite all that, this show is still one of the best anime's existing, and again is a cornerstone of its kind. There's no other show like it out there, and it's 100% worth the watch.\
9/10\

    Having watched Cowboy Bebop for the first time back in the early 00s, I was really curious to see how it would pass the test of time. After all, not all great series have the same impact on you on a second run. However, this was not the case for Cowboy Bebop, a series so brilliantly crafted that it really makes you reconsider the quality of some of the shows currently airing.\
In my opinion, characters are one of the most outstanding aspects of this show. With four main leads, it would have been easy to make them stick together all the time and create one\
          \
        storyline for all of them to fit in. However, notwithstanding the importance of ‘team moments,’ I love how personal background has such a big role in this show, with flashbacks and encounters from the past casting light over the people we see on the screen.\
Character development is one of the main reasons why each episode feels so important in terms of where the show is going. There might not be a big end goal for these four misfits, but you remain hooked until the very end because you still want to get to know them more. What in other shows would be considered ‘filler episodes’ has a different importance in Cowboy Bebop, where absolutely nothing goes to waste. Even the secondary characters that you meet along the way are memorable and you wish you will see them again at some point in the future.\
Despite being shot 20 years ago, the action scenes are still pretty amazing – I actually wish there were more. However, considering the aim is to mix different ingredients (comedy, drama, romance, sci-fi), everything seems perfectly balanced.\
Finally, a word about the soundtrack. The opening titles are some of the most iconic in TV animation, and the use of jazz tracks throughout the series really stands out as an inspired director choice. I would listen to this soundtrack over and over.",

    The story of cowboy bebop is well..... episodic.There are three kinds of episodes.The episode with Spike,Jet and Faye hunting for bounty heads or try to find food .The episodes with character development and backstorys and the ones with the actual story with Vicious,Juia and Spike.The art was preety good  most characters looked pretty good and for its time it was really good.Now the winning point of cowboy bebop(too me at least)the characters, all of the characters were important and not annoying the villain Vicious was by far my favourite a total badass and one of the best villains9in my opinion).I really enjoyed the series\
          \
        because of the awesome setting and great episodes by far my favourite was the one with the fat crazy murderer\

    So for my first review I decided to tackle one of the most hyped and well regarded anime around. Hope I'm not being too ambitious.\
Cowboy Bebop is, in one word, cool. Everything about it is cool: the soundtrack, the art style, the characters... everything. But the amount of coolness can not hide some of it's problems. It is an overall pretty good show but I found it somewhat lacking in some aspects. So lets start with the things I enjoyed and them move on to what I think it could have done better.\
First, I should say that it took me a long time to make\
          \
        up my mind about watching Cowboy Bebop. Even though it was recommend to me endless times, I just couldn't get over the fact that it was a rather old show and that the animation would suck - I'm someone that easily discards shows if I don't like the way they are animated. But it turns out I was wrong! The animation has hold out pretty well and it has something very stylish about it. The character's designs are great - except for Faye's awful even though iconic yellow suit - and the whole universe is full of charisma. The soundtrack is just as great, having one the best opening songs ever - hell I'm listening to it right now just to get pumped to write this review.\
The episodes are very entertaining, full of action and funny moments. There are also a few more dramatic episodes and others where you can see they were trying to mimic or mock some genres, which adds to the show. There's some variety to the characters which is a plus and their iterations with each other can by very funny to watch.\
But for such an iconic show I was expecting a little bit more of a story. Truth is that in all of the 26 episodes maybe 5 or 6 of them really matter for the plot. Every other episode just repeats more or less the same formula: there's a bounty to catch, Spike, Faye and sometimes Jet go after it, they all get in each other's way, they manage to catch it (or not) and in the end are still broke because they have to pay for all the damage they made. It is entertaining to watch but at some point you start to expect a bit more.\
The characters don't really help much in developing the story either. Even though they all have at least one episode dedicated to them individually, they don't really change. Faye is the most frustrating one, having such an interesting back story and not really changing when she finally finds out what she wanted to know.\
There are a few episodes about Spike that hint to a very complex and interesting story. This actually seems to be the plot the whole show was supposed to revolve around but it doesn't. This leads to a last episode that even though is cool and has fun action scenes, just seems like it came out of nowhere. In the end none of the characters learned anything and, even though they might have started to care for each other, they don't show it.\
I might sound overcritical towards a show that I rated pretty high. The thing is that a see the amount of potencial Cowboy Bebop had. Every episode is entertaining but when it leads to nothing, even though it seemed it wanted to lead to something, it is a bit frustrating. If it was just a show about the daily struggles of the cast I would be completely fine with it. But when it adds Spike's darker story and tries to pass it as a main plot point even though it is brushed off for most of the show I just get confused. I think Cowboy Bebop could lose that whole plot and be just as good, if not better.\
But overall, this is a great show that you will certainly enjoy and have fun with. I guess the best way to watch it is just to forget about the hype and not take the story too seriously.\

    “And the work which has become a genre unto itself shall be called… Cowboy Bebop”\
This is one of the quotes you’ll be seeing during the eye catches of the show and it’s not far off from reality. Cowboy Bebop is an anime that mixes many genres to make one entertaining journey. Episodic in format, this anime contains many different story of many different lives while uncovering the main cast’s back story slowly. The show starts off with a glimpse of the Spike’s past, the anime’s lead. With a dark, mysterious opening, then to a fun, jazz-heavy theme, it won’t take long for someone to realize\
          \
        that this anime isn’t just one genre. From action-adventure, to mystery-drama, this anime hits on all of the genre without feeling weak on any sides. A classic to many, a masterpiece to some, this is Cowboy Bebop.\
~{Story}~\
Due to Cowboy Bebop being episodic, it doesn’t have its main story being continued one episode after the other. Instead, the main story is broken up into pieces, with smaller story arcs fill up the gaps. Normally I don’t like episodic shows unless they’re slice of life anime, but this show manages to present its story in a way were it seems a non-episodic format might have ruined it. The premise is a group of bounty hunters (Spike and Jet, then Faye and Edward being introduced later in the show) who try to capture bounties in order to, well, live. Almost each episode has their own story and you’ll notice very quickly how each episode has its own taste to it; each episode feels different from one another. Some will get you pumped up, others may make you teary. What Cowboy Bebop does so well is making sure these tiny stories don’t make the entire anime messy or unorganized. It manages to present each story it has to offer without making it feel disjointed. The main story however is simple but it’s just so well presented that you enjoy the story more than you do. Mentioning the main story in the review is spoilers because it takes place well in the anime. It’ll take a handful of episodes to know what the main story is. Let’s just say, it has something to do with Spike’s past, which you get a glimpse of in the first seconds of the anime. Just don’t expect the main story to be shown consecutively, as it is interrupted by many other, smaller stories. And as many said before, it’s not about the destination, but rather the journey.\
Story: 9.5/10\
~{Presentation}~\
It was the one of the most westernized anime of its time for sure. Not many anime can properly be westernized without looking like a mess or without have a small audience. However Cowboy Bebop manages to have a westernized feel to it which helped it to get an audience outside of Japan, without losing Japan’s audience. Cowboy Bebop’s look to it is what helped anime become more popular in North America and Europe, therefore Bebop has achieved so much, and influenced so many thing is both Western culture and Japan’s too. Many anime tried to copy the westernized feel of Bebop, but fail to be as good as what it’s influenced by. Also, Bebop is one of the most stylish anime I have ever seen. The style is composed of many factors, such as it balancing many genres, its westernized and more modern feel, and it music-heavy presentation. Music isn’t just used in its, well, music, but in other things too such as the names of the episodes are called sessions and each name is some reference to music. Cowboy Bebop also has a very consistent pacing. It’s never too fast, nor slow. Each episode, being in an episodic format, flows perfectly from one another, even though they don’t connect from one another. The reason so is because each episode starts at a slow pace, build up to higher note, then slowly brings the pace down then ends its episode. The fact that each episode doesn’t end it a fast pace helps create a flow as the next episode needs to start in a slow pace in order to build up a different story. But in the end, all I can say is that the presentation cannot be compared to any anime because of how unique it is.\
Presentation: 9.5/10\
~{Character}~\
The main cast consists of four people: Spike (the cool, chill bounty hunter who’s past comes back to him), Jet (the ex-cop now bounty hunter who is the most level headed of the bunch), Faye (the attractive, yet deadly bounty hunter who isn’t the most brightest), and Ed (the wacky little girl who is an expert hacker). Each character is so distinctively unique from one another, yet they together make the perfect combination. Each character is so well done, you just don’t notice it until the end. You start off with knowing nothing about these characters, yet you enjoy watching them. And as you progress through the anime, you learn more and more about these characters, you start understand they’re feeling, not matter how much they try to hide it. Each character has their own past and they are so well done. Even Ed’s backstory makes sense. These stories they hide makes them so real and convincing. They are by far the best cast of characters I have ever seen. Even the supporting characters are well fleshed out, even if most of them have only one episode to develop. When an episode makes you cry you’ll be wondering how a character that you’ve only met for minutes, made you so emotional so quickly. When the climax hits and you know about the characters more, the outcome just feels heavier.\
Character: 10/10\
~{Art}~\
Since Cowboy Bebop takes place many years in the future, the world that is presented in this anime is much bleaker than you would expect from a future-heavy sci-fi. Crime rates are way too high, poverty in every corner, this is a future that is convincingly real and possible. The show’s art is very detailed as every detail is visible to everything, and objects far away have enough detail to not find it distracting. This anime has many details to objects that don’t need any, such as liquor bottles have labels that are sometimes readable. The show really shows the contrast between vivid colors and muddy, gloomy colors and use those colors to describe situations. The best example would be when Spike goes to Mars. Where the rich live, building are clean and the art’s glossiness helps show that and the lush green grass represents the life in the area. But other sections in Mars, such as where construction is still taking place, or ghost towns, darker, moodier colors are used to represent the area. The show doesn’t need words to represent situations as the art takes care of that. The details in the art makes me feel why can’t others do the same? Anime these days tends to take shortcuts but making background objects less detailed and not use the art to explain situation. Cowboy Bebop was way ahead of its time back then, and sadly it sometimes seems as if it’s ahead of time today too.\
Art: 10/10\
~{Animation}~\
Most of the anime is hand drawn except for a few areas. The parts that were computer animated were rotating objects in space, as to make them move smoothly, CG would be more helpful. But everything is hand-drawn and the effort is clearly visible. During fight sequences, for example the one at the end of the first episode, you will notice how fluid and crisp the animation is. When Spike gave a while sliding off a table, that’s when it hit me; it’s too fluid for its time. I’m not a 90’s kid, but I know how animation was back then. Never have I seen hand-drawn animation be so fluid from that time. But the animation has a style to. The cinematography is very impressive. The anime sometimes uses a top view to show the landscape of the area, and it works really well. And there are so many tiny details in the show to. Some anime are too lazy to animate the backgrounds, but Bebop puts in all they got. Some of the animations in backgrounds are subtle, yet noticeable. In today’s standard this may seem normal, but for 1998, it’s quite a lot. Even animations for character lip-syncing is much more impressive than anime today. \
Animation: 10/10\
~{Voice Acting}~\
The Japanese voice cast is filled well-known artists. Kōichi Yamadera as Spike is fantastic, as he portrays coolness in Spike and emotions in him when necessary. Unshō Ishizuka as Jet is great, as he able to probably portray strength and matureness with his voice acting capabilities, but is also able to portray weakness too. Megumi Hayashibara as Faye is superb as she can do the fragile side and the weak side of Faye properly. Aoi Tada, who didn’t have much experience before Bebop, was able to capture the wackiness of Ed flawlessly. But this is one of the fewer anime where I found the English voice acting better than the Japanese voice acting, mainly because of Spike. Steve Blum as Spike is beyond words. Not only is he able to portray coolness to a next level, but his also able to add charm too. Not to mention, some of Spike’s lines sound way cooler in English. Beau Billingslea’s Jet isn’t as convincing as Ishizuka’s, but it’s still good enough. Billingslea’s lacked the emotions Ishizuka portrayed. Wendee Lee’s Faye was much more convincing than Hayashibara’s as she was able to sound more powerful and weaker than the original Japanese voice acting. Melissa Fahn’s Ed is on par with Tada’s although I did like the fact that Tada’s voice acting made it seem confusing at first what gender Ed really is. The supporting cast’s voice acting is fantastic, both Japanese and English.\
Voice Acting: 10/10\
~{Music}~\
What Yoko Kanno created with Cowboy Bebop is beyond words; this has to be the greatest OST ever created for any media ever. The OP, “Tank!”, is outstanding. The perfect blending of jazz is just the best thing to hear and it really sets the tone of the show; it lets you know that a journey is ahead. The ED, “The Real Folk Blues”, is fantastic too. There are two other EDs, one being “Space Lion” (at Episode 13), and “Blue” (at Episode 26). In my opinion, these two EDs are way better than “The Real Folk Blues”, and they sound even better in the anime while you’re experiencing what is happening in the situation. Many other tracks, such as “Rush”, “Spokey Dokey”, “Rain”, “Words That We Couldn’t Say”, “Call Me Call Me”, are just some of the many tracks that makes Cowboy Bebop so special. With nearly 10 hours of OST, it’s obvious that there was a lot of effort put into the music. And many of the tracks were either not used or used very minimally. Many songs have been used of for the eye-catches, for example “Fantaisie Sign” is one of my favorite tracks from the OST, but was only used during the eye-catches of the anime. Another great thing about this anime is that besides the OP and ED, no track is repeated twice, not even for the eye-catches. Some people make a mistake thinking “The Real Folk Blues” was used for the final moments of the anime, but it was actually “See You Space Cowboy”, which used the same music, just the lyrics are different. With each track being used not more than once, there is no repetitiveness in the music. No matter how much you hate Bebop, you must love the soundtrack… unless you hate Jazz, or good music.\
Music: 10/10\
~{Enjoyment}~\
With many different genres in this anime, there is something for everyone. Not everyone will love every episode because some may not come from their preferred genre, but there’s always some episodes that instantly become your favorite because it’s your type of episode. Once you finish the anime, you’ll feel like watch some episodes again, the ones that were your favorite. Also, due to the anime being episodic, it’s easy to just pick a random episode and watch it (once you’re done the anime that is), without losing the experience. Whenever I don’t have anything to do, I just select one of my favorite Bebop episode and watch it. If you want a lighthearted moment, or you want to fiddle around with your emotions, you know what episodes to watch. A little bit of action, watch this episode. A little bit of drama, watch that episode. There are many pop culture references in Cowboy Bebop, both Japanese and Western, so that’s a little extra for more enjoyment. Also, if you really enjoy the soundtrack, you can listen to it whenever you’re doing something, and maybe get addicted to it like I still am.\
Enjoyment: 10/10\
With all those 10s I’ve given, it doesn’t mean it’s a perfect anime, because nothing is really. It’s just that this the closest an anime can get to perfect. There are one or two hiccups in road, but nothing big enough to stop the ride. An anime I watched seven times (three times in Japanese, four in English), it still doesn’t get old. With it having a heavy influence of introducing anime in western culture, it surely is a classic, and a masterpiece. \
+ Outstanding cast of characters\
+ Enjoyable, small stories build up to one journey\
+ Greatest soundtrack created for any medium\
+ Japanese and English, both voice acting is superb\
+ Stylish and properly westernized\
+ Fluid, hand-drawn animations with great detail to every art\
Overall: 9.9/10\

    *This review may include minor spoilers*\
Cowboy Bebop. I was pretty late to the party in watching this series but my my was it completely worth it. Cowboy Bebop is not your run of the mill westernised anime about space ships and guns. It is something much more. Let's find out why. \
The story is set in 2071, when the Earth has become polluted beyond repair and the Human Race has colonized most of the Solar System. \
The story begins with our protagonist Spike Spiegel, who's a bounty hunter,  subtly looking for his bounty on Mars like its just another day at the job. What's\
          \
        interesting is the fact that nothing very significant happens in the first episode. Yet, it manages to convey things in such an impeccable fashion that I was simply blown away by it. The fight choreography was top notch, the animation/art style was fluid and captivating and the writing was nothing short of astounding. It is one of those series' which take you into a completely different world when you're watching it but at the same time, there's this feeling of familiarity.\
Sound: \
Of course, I couldn't possibly call it a fair review if I don't talk about how amazing the sound is. The music choice is great. It is able to encapsulate the vibes of the scenes in an unparalleled fashion. \
The OP and ED were also really good.\
The series continues in an episodic fashion in which the two members of the Bebop(Spike and his teammate Jet) get acquainted with more people along the way, for the better or worse. Most of the series just comprises the Bebop going on adventures and chasing their bounties. But as we witness this story with them, we learn about the characters that there's much more to them than meets the eye. You can't help get attached to the characters as the story progresses. \
This is a series which gave me chills by the end of every episode. Legitimate chills. It is very thought provoking and the finale was nothing less than a masterpiece. I recommend watching this series without a second thought as it has a little bit of something for everyone. \

    Cowboy Bebop is the kind of anime that you like the minute it starts, with that marvelous soundtrack/opening. The narrative is about some adventures of a group of bounty hunters in the future in space, where they fight and laugh, live together and trust each others (in their own way), and in each episode you got something new. Yes it's something kinda \"old\" (1988), and there are some fans who can dislike the graphics, but in my opinion it's something very cool and I strongly suggest this one to all of members who didn't had the time or the desire to watch it.\

    Very rarely, if ever, do I feel so strongly about a product, offering or service so much that I feel compelled to write a review about it. Cowboy Bebop falls on the very end of the positive side of that spectrum. If you are wholly unfamiliar with Cowboy Bebop, well, read the summary on it's page.\
I've never really watched a lot of anime. A few episodes of some intensely popular anime such as Death Note and Shigeki no Kyojin aside, the medium is foreign to me. However, the immense praise that I've seen for Cowboy Bebop on the internet combined with the comfort of it\
          \
        being readily available to watch on Netflix, enticed me to give the show a shot. I am very, very glad I did.\
The way Bebop is built up is fairly interesting. The show is quite episodic; on a practical standpoint, every main character (Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed) have a few episodes that are basically 'their' episodes, focusing most entirely around those characters. These episodes mostly tap into these characters being confronted in some form with their past. What in my opinion are the best episodes, are the episodes centered around Spike. These tense, dramatic episodes, is where in my opinion Cowboy Bebop excels even further than it already does. Beautiful animation, woven deftly with what is the most amazing score to any film/series I have ever seen, while you are slowly being let into more and more of Cowboy Bebop's secrets. The first minute of the show is practically the plateau on which Spike's story is built, making his episodes especially rewarding. It gives a more consistent tone to what is otherwise, like I said before, a fairly episodic show.\
Overall, I have enjoyed Cowboy Bebop immensely. It's a sight to behold, a glory to listen to. It's enthralling, and relentlessly clever. I recommend it immensely.",

    Cowboy Bebop - The futuristic calamities and tragedies of a carefree bounty hunter and his companions. If you haven't seen it, you better get to it! The blend and implications of this space drama is loaded with great humor and action, not to mention the art style for it's day was nonparallel.

    Cowboy bebop is an anime that was written by Keiko Nobumoto in 1998. The story takes place in the year 2071 follows what starts off as a pair of bounty hunters named Spike and Jet who travel aboard the spacecraft 'bebop'.  As the series progresses, their group quickly grows to five with the addition of the data dog Ein, an odd woman named Faye Valentine and a little girl named Edward, who seems to be the brains of the operation while still being totally childish.Technically speaking, out of Bebop's twenty six episodes, only five of them have any plot element to them, the rest\
          \
        are totally episodic. These one episode stand-alones can range from incredibly silly (Mushroom samba) to incredibly deep and sad (Perriot de fou). However, no matter what, every episode strives to add something to one, or even all of our main characters. Bebop certainly shines most when it's exploring the actual plot, but these episodes wouldn't shine as much if they hadn't spent so much time giving depth to the characters. The actual plot of the show is about Spike's feud with a man named Vicious. I won't dive much further into details, as to not to spoil, though. It finally concludes with what is rightfully known as one of the most fitting ends to an anime series. \
Now we'll touch on the characters. It's impossible not to love someone in the main cast. They are all very well developed and loveable characters. From the cool and thoughtful Jet to the odd and off the wall Edward, there's always someone to love. Spike himself is also a great character, however, I'm sure most people have heard enough about how cool he is, and although it's true, I shan't go on about it any more than that. Faye is a real femme fatale and a very strong female character that is very independent, but can also come off as rather cold and selfish, and she is. She is also often as foolish as Spike, can also match him in terms of bravery. Ed's weird, that much is certain, but it doesn't make her annoying, her brand of weird just makes her more likeable, which is something not so easily pulled off. As mentioned, Spike is cool, foolish, brave and stubborn. He is also intelligent when he needs to be, but likes to wallow in the past even when he tells others not to. Jet is a strong leader of the group, who often keeps the group together and keeps them from hurting themselves. Without him, who knows how much more trouble the crew would get in. Overall, bebop has an outstanding cast of characters, among whom you will find at least one character to love.\
The animation is another great point for bebop. This show was made over ten years ago, but the animation matches up to the best of the best today. It's clear how much effort went into every frame. The characters have large (although not as large as some anime) eyes that display strong emotions, but for the most part, the characters look and move much like real humans. The animals are also probably some of the more realistic animals seen in animation. They look and move more like actual animals rather than cartoons.  \
What do we all know about bebop? The music of course! Bebop's soundtrack fits so masterfully with the show that it is impossible to ignore and impossible to forget. The oddest songs play at the most seemingly out of place of times and really have no business working as well as they always do. The music in Cowboy bebop is always spot-on and never misses, ever. Yoko Kanno always does a great job, another example of her work being the score in Wolf's rain, which was also created by Keiko Nobumoto. Oddly enough, though, the soundtrack listened to without the show just isn't quite the same. The music needs the show to be effective, but when paired with the show, it is just that, very effective. It is also a mix of so many different genres, most prominent being Jazz, but there are also many other genres mixed in here and there. The opening (Tank) and ending (The Real folk blues) credits are also a force to be reckoned with, both fitting the series extremely well and you never want to skip them. Both of them are extremely well done and probably some of the best in anime. \
The voice acting, although strong in Japanese, is a treat to watch in English. The English voice actors really breathe new life into their characters. The main example of this being Melissa Charles as Edward. She is the one who makes Edward so loveable. She made her odd personality charming rather than annoying, which the Japanese voice actor didn't quite do. Of course, everyone in the English cast is top-notch and you should definitely watch this one in English, Edward just needed special mention.\
Overall, while Bebop's premise may not be entirely original, the execution is outstanding, it's an exciting show with a lot to offer. It can and will be enjoyed by just about anyone. It's one and only shortcoming is the fact that the story is episodic for the most part, which may turn some people off, but this is overcome with a strong cast, amazing visuals and a breathtaking musical score, along with the fact that when the plot of the story shows up, it is even more exciting than the stand alones that were great to begin with. This show simply cannot be compared to anything in existence.\

    This is one of those series that most people will rave about. Across the board, you will find that most people will recommend this series. I am going to not be one of those people, per se. Cowboy Bebop is worth watching, but there are things about it that some might not find so fun. The characters for the most part are good, I have some issues with Spike and Faye personally, but overall they're likable. The music is wonderful, alone warranting a look into the soundtrack. I think what turns me off, a little, is the lack of a continuous plot, which does work\
          \
        for this and some other series, but not others. It DOES work for Cowboy Bebop, but it throws a lot of what to expect up in the air, which can be exciting but can also leave very little to expect. And I will say this, depressing could be an accurate summation of the series overall. I won't say that a series or something shouldn't make you sad or should always have a happy ending, but to me that just rounds out a good story so well. I don't like being built up to be let down at the end, and Cowboy Bebop did that to me a bit.\
So, in the end, if you haven't already seen it, check it out if you feel like it, I'm not gonna say to watch it one way or the other.\

    Cowboy bebop is a very rare anime in the sense that there really isn't too much to the story, yet it is still a very entertaining and enjoyable series. It's is just about the only anime where the english dub is probably better than the japanese language version. On a personal note though, I enjoyed the Cowboy Bebop movie a little more than the show.\
Definitely worth watching multiple times. \

    The Cowboy Bebop series is about the adventures of a spaceship called the Bebop and its crew of bounty hunters. This Anime has an impressive combination of sound, visuals, and music. Each episode of Cowboy Bebop is almost like a short movie; only a few times does one episode require advanced knowledge of a previous one for it to make sense. Spike Spiegel is the enigmatic main character, who is complemented by the very cool-headed and likeable Captain of the Bebop; Jet Black. Later in the series various other character will join in, making up the Bebop&rsquo;s crew; Faye Valentine, Ed and a Genetically enhanced\
          \
        dog, named Ein. \
This Anime has a good mix of action, from martial arts, awesome gunplay, to explosive space battles. There is quite a bit of light-hearted humor, but more sinister plots are a part of the whole. The musical scores enhance the overall feel of the show; the retro-jazz type music is unique to say the least. If you listen to only the music, you would never guess that it is in any way connected to an anime, Let alone one&rsquo;s soundtrack!\
\
DARGON / Tera-Alpha's Notes:\
This Anime searies is excelent! I have watched all of the episodes aired on Cartoon Network. The story line is unique in that it comes from a lot of differant directions, and is still exciting. The last episode does seem to be missing something, but there may be more to come; either as another season of the series or an OVA Movie (P.S.: A movie was reliesed some time after this review was originaly made. The movie was quite good, but basicaly like a longer eppisode that was stand alone from the plotline of the series.). \

    This was one of my first anime ever. (not counting Pokemon and Digimon) After years I decided to rewatch and it was totally worth it. I missed so many things before. \
Almost everyone get caught by Spike Spiegel. I doubt that there is a cooler character in any other anime. When you finish this anime, you'll feel a need to just walk around with hands in your pockets and disinterested face. During the whole anime we can see some flashbacks and hints about his past but the main thought comes in the two final episodes which are truly epic. Not epic like American action films\
          \
        but epic for the simplicity of the ending.\
But it would be such a pity not to mention all the other characters, every with a unique personal story. To be honest I think I don't know any other anime with better characters and their background. \
Jet, cool-looking bounty hunter cooperating with Spike and acting a bit like a boss or even like an older brother to everyone on his ship. Faye, a girl who lost her memory and comes from a long time ago. She's acting cool and self-assured but then you realise that it's just a mask to hide her real face of someone who doesn't really know where he belongs and who maybe finally found something like home. Ein, genial dog (kinda cute one :D) and Ed. Hehe looks like it's she but none can say for sure. I can guarantee that you will be looking forward to every scene with Ed, they are really hilarious.\
During the whole series we follow this bunch hunting villains as their job and I gotta say that some episodes are really deep. No fantasy, no fairy tale, just life as it is. \
But life is just a dream in the end....\

    Cowboy Bebop is an amazing anime.  The series itself is about 85% episodic, meaning that each episode is a stand alone story.  Only a few episodes follow a certain 'overall' story arc, which involves Spike's past and someone who used to be his friend, who has now turned into his bitter enemy.  Spike (the main character) slowly reveals his past through short flashbacks and dream sequences.  What truly happens in his past is never fully explained and is left open for the viewer to interpret.\
All episodes are unique and interesting.  Some may involve getting a bounty and catching a wanted\
          \
        criminal while others may be about something as simple as beating a genius at chess.  The randomness of the episodes and the story that each one tells makes Cowboy Bebop original, unpredictable, and entertaining.\
The character designs in this series are extremely well done.  Each character looks very detailed in appearance and is unique in personalities and character traits.  The animation is also very impressive and reaches a point that Cowboy Bebop can be compared to anime that have been released recently.  This is an impressive feat considering that it was released in 1998.\
The soundtrack is also one of the best I have ever heard.  Cowboy Bebop is my second favorite in terms of music, second only to FLCL.  The jazz influence can be found in multiple episodes and plays an important role in the overall tone of the series.  From the fast paced opening 'Tank!' to the well suited and stylized music played in certain scenes (falling from a church window, chasing a criminal, jazz and blues played at a local lounge, etc.), and the critically acclaimed ending song 'The Real Folk Blues,' the music isn't just 'there' but adds to the anime as a whole and to some fans, the music defines Cowboy Bebop.  Even the episode titles are named after songs or musical components.\
Cowboy Bebop also has a certain style that is hard to describe.  From all of the anime that I have seen, this is one of a kind and can't be imitated (although Samurai Champloo comes close).  Every setting is astonishing and easy on the eyes.  There are high class space casinos, freezing cold planets with lowly criminals, futuristic cities with skyscrapers, and even barren deserts filled with nothing but sand.  Each new location provides a new 'feel' that defines that episode.  This anime also provides so many genre types that it is hard to classify.  In some ways, Cowboy Bebop is a genre in of itself.  It can be lightly humored like 'Mushroom Samba,' melancholy and depressing like 'Waltz for Venus,' action oriented and story driven like 'The Real Folk Blues parts 1 and 2,' and simply brilliant like 'Ballad of Fallen Angels.'  This anime offers so much that it can appeal to ANY kind of anime fan.  If you blend incredible music, visuals, stories, and settings, you end up with nothing but the essence of Cowboy Bebop's style.\
By the last two episodes, Spike finally catches up to his ex-friend turned bitter rival and fights to bring peace to himself for what has happened in the past.  The ending is so dramatic, well done, and overwhelming, that it is my favorite anime ending of all time.  The ending is well deserved for the series and brings this awesome series to a stunning conclusion.\

    This is the show that started it all for me, I was never really that interested in Japanese animation, with the exception of shows like Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh (but what kid didn't watch these shows?).\
The very first thing that caught my eye (or rather my ears) was the music. Jazz was something I never really understood or liked, but the first time I heard those dynamic notes in the opening, I was hooked. Furthermore, the dubbing was great, I usually find that the English voice actors can never quite capture the same feeling that the Japanese voice actors could. It still remains one of the\
          \
        only shows I watched dubbed. I never found a reason to watch the Japanese version, especially since the show reflects a lot of Western influence.\
The story, although disjointed, still offered me the perspectives and philosophies of the characters. Character development is never ignored in the plot, and you get sucked into the perceptions and feelings of the antagonists and even the minor characters. Sure, you want to root for the protagonists, but never at any point do you see the characters as truly black and white. They all have their motives and meaning. \
For its time, the art and animation was fantastic; the grand scenery, the fluid movements, mature character designs, as well as the ambiance set a new standard for me at the time. I've probably watched this show half a dozen times, and even in recent memory, I never thought that the needed to be remade or updated.\
I still listen to \"The Real Folk Blues\" every now and then.\

    Cowboy Bebop. Wow. What can I say that hasn't already been said? Instead of just writing a straightforward review, let me tell you WHY this is probably in my top 3 anime series of all time.\
-It's got interesting characters\
-The fight scenes are choreographed so well and the jazz-like music in the background mixes so well with the mood\
-It has a fairly non-linear plot, so many of the episodes could be watched on their own without missing any important information from the previous episode\
-It's got an amazing ending, perhaps one of the best of all time\
-It doesn't ever take itself too seriously, but at the same\
          \
        time never attempts to be campy.\
-The music tends to be awesome\
-A large variety of different episodes; from the serious nature of the last two episodes to the goofy nature of the mushroom episode\
I could go on. Let me just end with this: this was one of the first serious anime series that I ever watched (was about 13 or so when I first saw CB) and is still  is one of my all-time favorite series.\
Bottom line: check out Cowboy Bebop if you haven't. There's a good chance that you'll find at least one thing from this show that you'll really like.\

    Cowboy Bebop, this is one show it seems most have seen. It has been regarded as one of the best anime of all time, well, I wouldn't go that far but it was definitely good. I was turned off for a while with this show because I thought it was going to be some rip-off of star wars or some Sci-Fi I didn't want to see. But I thought the same thing (except the Star Wars part) about FMA brotherhood and I ate my words. So I figured I'd give this a shot. If you are like how I was and are avoiding Cowboy Bebop\
          \
        lemme tell ya... it's only 26 episodes make the investment, you won't be disappointed.\
Story-Ok here is the deal here, the cannon story is really good. The action is amazing I couldn't believe how awesome the action scenes were. The comedy was always a plus and the mystery and deep meaning got me and will get you hooked. But in the middle of the amazing story are a bunch of side adventures that you can call filler. Don't get me wrong the filler doesn't suck, but compared to the cannon and it kinda is pointless. There were some filler that was pretty amazing but others were a drag to get through and at the end of the filler episodes it doesn't leave anyone hanging which makes it tough to get through the filler and get back to the cannon in a short amount of time. Maybe you or others don't agree remember this is my opinion but some of the filler isn't worth it. \
Art- The art was an older style of art, this was a 90's anime so it is what one would expect. Of course not the best art I've seen but it works with the story. The fight scenes are really well animated and everything has their own distinct look. Props on the animators job well done.\
Sound- The sound was amazing, everything fit just where it should have been, every soundtrack was perfect. When it was a sad moment the music made me feel that much more sad and the same is for happy and intense and all other possible emotions. The opening was amazing, such a catchy beat. I watched this in Dub because of the love for this show in Dub so I took popular opinion and watched this Dubbed and the voices were done so well. Even the extras were really well done when in some anime the extras have really bad voice acting skills. If I were to give the sound one piece of criticism it would be i didn't like the ending. There aren't many endings I like anyway for some reason but it is no reason to drop a level.  \
Characters- It's characters like those of Cowboy Bebop that makes one cherish anime. The characters aren't even developed in the beginning (for mystery of course) and little by little you learn more and more. If that bugs you trust me the show  makes up for it with how bad ass everyone is. The villain although has kind of a stupid name, is so epic along with Spike and the crew that you wish you knew these guys in real life. \
Overall besides lack luster episodes the show was a truly great. You get hooked from the start with awesome action sequences, you meet knew people good and bad that make the show so damn good, and the Dub and sound is incredible. I can understand why people regard this as one of the best shows of all time. Personally it does not crack my top 5 but it would absolutely get my #7 spot behind Rurouni Kenshin. It was truly a show I could watch again, and oh by the way, the movie is probably the best anime movie  I have seen to date, yeah, it was that good. But Cowboy Bebop is a show worth watching and I promise you will like it,\

    First, I'd like to say that Cowboy Bebop is a very good anime. Some of you are probably wondering why I gave it a 7 if I thought it was so good.  There are two reasons. First, it is too episodic for my tastes. And I don't know the second one. I've tried and tried to put into words my other reason for not giving it a higher rating but I just don't know how to say it. There is something off about this anime that I can't pinpoint and it prevents me from giving this anime a higher score. I have never been\
          \
        so conflicted about an anime in my life. \
Background & Brief Overview: \
Before I started this anime, I read the synopsis and thought it was really interesting to have a western/space mix. It reminded me of Stephen King's book series The Dark Tower which combines Western with science fantasy. The anime is about a group of bounty hunters that travel around space catching criminals, discovering and fighting their pasts. At first, there are two members of this hapless group: Spike Spiegel, a former hitman, and his friend Jet Black, a former ISSP officer. Later, a computer hacker, Edward, and con artist, Faye, and a data dog, Ein, join the group. The anime is very episodic. Basically, it's a bunch of events that happen to this group put together in a series with a one major overarching plot. Throughout the series, the pasts of the crew are explored. \
It took me my entire sophomore year of college to finish this anime. Besides the fact that I was busy with school, I had no real drive to watch this anime. The show was so episodic that I wouldn't need to refresh my memory when I got back to it. Normally, if I found the anime interesting, I would start and finish relatively quickly. For example, during my freshman year, I finished Death Note in a week. I couldn't do that with Cowboy Bebop because it didn't pique my interest from the very beginning. The art and sound were really good. The sound really complemented the animation. \
A Closer Look:\
Where Cowboy Bebop makes its mark is making anime appealing and enjoyable to the Western culture. It references many Western movies. If you have seen many classic Western films, you will recognize the references instantly, I personally did not get any of the references because I haven't seen many classic Westerns. As far as action goes, this anime is the cream of the crop. The action sequences are done beautifully and are meant to recall the mixed martial arts films of back in the day. \
An In-Depth Analysis:\
Although it may not seem like it amid the crazy story-line, everything in Cowboy Bebop is done for a reason. The characters are bounty hunters, an occupation that has long periods of boredom followed by brief intensity. The episodic nature of the show conveys this beautifully as the characters go months without any significant altercations. All the characters are running from something in their past. To do this, they need to be occupied by something. Ironically, the crew travels through vast spaces of nothingness which produced an unbearable ennui and as a result they are forced to confront their pasts. \
Another theme that is prevalent in the show is dreams. There are so many references to dreams in the show. Spike himself doesn't know whether he is in a dream or this is reality. The fact that this all could be a dream is reflected in Spike's nonchalant attitude and his hobby: sleeping. \
Lastly, the anime explores the power of one's past. Every character tries to run from the past but it somehow comes back and affects their future. With all the traveling and running the characters do, they can't run from their past suggesting that one's past is inescapable. Ii is a part of who you are and who you will be.\

    This anime called \"Cowboy Bebop\" is a very funny and quite well illustrated show that includes hilarious characters and also very bureaucratic characters, but as in bounty hunters.\
 The anime has a somewhat a good plot leading off with random skits of funniness and back to the main story, the art style is an old crisp style and I would have to say it matches the type of show that it is.\
 The sound was fine with the vehicles / shootings / etc., Some of the characters sound very weird at first but then you'll get used to their voice.\
 The characters all have very\
          \
        different types of personalities, they have a funny / serious type to all the characters in the story.\
 I very much enjoyed the whole thing, and I would have to give the whole thing a 9.\

    This show is a timeless classic, after watching I honestly don't know why the heck I kept putting this show off. Because it's one of the best shows I've EVER seen. The music is so outstanding, I had the soundtrack looped for days. The cast is lovable, yet also have their own pasts, their own story. The script is very well written, with a lot of badass quotes you'd want to note down and keep them for use. As for the story... it goes from light-hearted comedy to complex, mature themes, but the balance is perfectly maintained, where serious scenes are weaved into the episodes\
          \
        in little bits and pieces. Despite not getting Spike's past laid out right smack at you, the flashbacks were more than enough for you to piece things together, and the entire process of figuring out is what makes it exhilarating. I'm just sad Ed and Ein had to leave at the end, and that there can never be a continuation to this AMAZING show. Also, animes these days really REALLY need to bring back jazz music fight scenes.\

    Anime like DBZ, Cowboy Bebop, and Naruto do not really require anymore reviewing.  They are so well-known and praised that you are either a fan or you're not.  There's not much to add to the topic but I was bored.\
Maybe because I was fairly young and not yet jaded by anime when I saw Cowboy Bebop, but I still consider this anime my favorite and one of the best I've ever seen.  It has everything; great art and animation, music and sound, characters, action, creative design, style, and story.  I'm also positively biased towards anime with a definitive beginning in end,\
          \
        usually lasting only one or two seasons.  I have trouble getting into endless series like Naruto and Dragonball even when I was younger.\
I especially like the pop culture references.  Examples are the Bruce Lee inspired fighting, John Woo gun play, multiple episodes that feature the atmosphere of old Westerns, and an episode that even feels like my one of favorite sci-fi movies, the original \"Alien.\"\
I mentioned characters, which is one of the best elements of Cowboy Bebop.  Strong female characters are always a plus and the iconic Faye Valentine is certainly up there with the best.  She's both sexy and entertaining but the spotlight belongs to Spike Spiegel.  He is a refreshing change from the usual cliches of anime protagonists.  He has since been imitated with varying degrees of success, but at the time, there were few characters written and created as well as Spike.\
I could go on forever talking about Cowboy Bebop.  Like I said, with an anime that is on so many \"top\" lists there isn't much point.  I would recommend this to any one looking for a quality anime.\

    One of the classical gems, personally I am very picky with my anime. The first time I encountered Cowboy bebop was in 2001. At the age of eleven I fell in love with cowboy bebop and when I grew up it played a large role in defining my taste in the genre.\
I'm not obsessed with Japanese culture but I respect good anime when I watch it. Quite honestly I dislike a lot of anime too but cowboy bebop just overall was and is so good.\
While episodic in nature each individual story really sets up and tells the stories of these bounty hunters, that was the\
          \
        point, in my opinion of having individual stories set in individual episodes. Bebop isn't about some hero trying to save the world from evil. It's about the lives of the crew, what they do to survive, they are just people with extraordinary pasts, that have specialized skills for the jobs they perform. It's a gathering of different personalities that after awhile they grew onto each other and this is reflected later on.\
Once the \"main arc\" of the story reveals itself it turns into quite a roller coaster, and each character obviously has their own back story revealed in their respective episodes. If you're looking for a cliched anime obviously this won't probably do it for you but for fans that are looking for more. This show is for you. \
The only way I can see you even having anything negative about this show is if you're trying to be a hipster or search for things you dislike. There is games, anime etc i have personally disliked but i could respect that game or movie for being good but sometimes things don't click with you. That's Bebop, it's a classic. Hate it or love it, you have to respect it.\

    What can I say about this show that hasn't already been said by everyone else that has ever reviewed this show? Despite the fact that I have watch the show beginning to end almost, and the movie which is also great, almost 10 times. Probably not much.\
First the bad:\
Well, if you are not a fan of action/drama oriented anime this show won't change your mind. That is pretty much all of the bad I can think of in terms of flaws.\
The good:\
This show is definitely in the top 25 anime for a reason. Fans of action, drama, sci-fi, or film noir anime agree pretty unanimously\
          \
        that this show is a must see.\
The animation, despite being nearly 20 years old, holds up extremely well and all the action scenes are still beautiful to look at.\
The characters are all memorable, cool, well written, well developed, and 3 dimensional.\
The soundtrack is arguably the greatest in all of anime. Especially if you are and lover of jazz and blues.\
The writing is amazing. It has some of the greatest dialogue in anime and knows when dialogue isn't needed. The story is presented in a way that does not insult the audiences intelligence and I can't think of a single instance of exposition (when character's speak in a way just so they can give information to the audience).\
Also, the dub is incredible. It is arguably the best dub in anime history and a must see. I have talked with people who refuse to watch dubs, that prefer Bebop dubbed. Some of the original Japanese voice actors and the creator of the series himself even admitted that the dub is better.\
This is easily my favorite anime and I can talk all day about why I love it, but I will spare you such torment so you can go watch the series ASAP.\

Cowboy Bebop's follows a peculiar team and their bounty hunting lives in a futuristic setting. The show exposes the corruption of it's world and clashing ideals of life through an episodic nature, letting each self contained story handle a new concept.\
As a very character driven experience each cast member has enough personality to show what they are all about in just a few scenes. Seeing them get involved in dangerous pursuits with high stakes each episode is really the basis of the show. Every side story is unique, and it efficiently engages you in the lives and problems of it's side characters throughout.\
The music is\
          \
        very western influenced, you get bits of Jazz, Bebop, Blues, and Soul; a unique mix that suits the show perfectly. You'll know know the feeling when it happens.\
Everyone has a past to deal with, and each character handles theirs differently. The universal truth is that life goes on, even after your most devastating moments. The weight might kill you or even make you stronger but regardless, that weight is what makes us human. The episodic nature of the show enhances this central theme. \
In every regard this show is incredible. Cowboy Bebop can reach out to so many, and serves as great introduction to what this medium is capable of.",

    Through the reborn industry of bounty hunting in the midst of a future humanity spread thin across the solar system, Cowboy Bebop deftly explores the effects of societal divergence, the interplay of various life philosophies, how feeling like an 'outsider' underpins us all - regardless of how our personalities may differ, and the all-singing existential question: what is reality for me and for you?\
These are far from simple themes to discuss for any show, yet Cowboy Bebop does so with a degree of nuance I find at odds with the oft-heavy-handed approach to storytelling and theme building in anime. Indeed, these thematic explorations are facilitated\
          \
        by what is often levied as a criticism to the show. Owing to Cowboy Bebop's primarily episodic nature (character introductions and the like notwithstanding), there can come a feeling of fragmentation and thus no overall flow; however, this is what I perceive to be the show's biggest asset. We are treated to twenty-six 'sessions' - musical motifs run strong throughout - and each of these explores one of the main characters, their backstories, and ultimately how they've become the way they are in the present day to an extent I feel a linear narrative would not have done so as succinctly. The three key characters - Spike, Jet and Faye - have some kind of past life they are trying to either come to terms with or escape from, and the series really does a great job at analysing them as individuals and as a collective party of nomadic bounty hunters in a disparate universe. The rich characterisation really enables you to grow attached to them and compels you to see where they take you - something which is actually quite a tall order considering the anime is only twenty-six episodes long, and all characters have relatively equal weighting in the show.\
Of course, the intricate thematic exploration is but one strength to Cowboy Bebop, but isn't necessarily a hook per se. Where the anime also excels is in its production. Shinichiro Watanabe's world-building is fascinatingly stylish and well-realised; every town, city, set piece throughout the series feels as though it belongs there, whilst providing the audience with a real sense of the state of the societies that have promulgated since the planetary colonising took place. Additionally, the crisp, fluid animation really adds to the immersion whilst the soundtrack - composed by Yoko Kanno - covers the jazz and blues spectrum, with both staccato and flowing, sombre and up-tempo pieces that all conspire to provide a truly compelling audiovisual experience that does not feel at odds to the tones of the show. \
Every time someone has asked me for an anime recommendation, Cowboy Bebop has always been first on my list. I feel that this is a masterpiece, a pillar of anime that, by marrying nuanced thematic discussions, engaging characters, quality production and world-building, transcends boundaries and allows people who wouldn't consider themselves anime fans as much as those who would to enjoy - perhaps even love - the series.  \

    Story 9/10\
     Though many of the stories/problems end in an episode, I think the viewers will find themselves enjoying most of the 26 episodes with the unique bounties, ways they catch them, the fighting scenes, and the slowly revealing tragic past of the characters. The last few episodes were very intense, and the ending was very shocking but I also believe they were able to wrap up the show perfectly. I myself did not enjoy all of the episodes though, there were maybe one or two episodes where I wanted more fighting scenes or more accomplishments.\
Characters 10/10\
           The characters in this anime all have their own originality and are unique. The protagonist of this anime, Spike Spiegel and one of the crew members, Edward are now one of my favourite characters. As each and one of the crews have different personalities, each and one of them stands out and they are all important to the story. The characters were very well developed, it was nice to see all of them change as they met and interacted with one another. It was nice to learn more about the characters in a very nice timing, I think they were able to decide on the best places to include the characters' sorrowful hidden past and helped the viewer feel connected to the characters.\
Music 10/10\
     The music played in this anime are just awesome. They are songs that makes one move along with the rhythm and the opening and ending songs are just so catchy and cool. I believe Yoko Kanno did a truly and unbelievably amazing work. All of the songs matches the scenes and none of them seemed to be out of place.\
Art 10/10\
   By comparing the art of this anime to the other 90's anime art, you can easily see how high quality the art of Cowboy Bebop is. Even if you compare the art of an anime that has been aired recently to Cowboy Bebop, the art quality of cowboy bebop may be better. The character design is very stylish and the fighting scenes are very well drawn. \
Overall 10/10\
     I really enjoyed this anime, it is now one of my favourite. The high quality fighting scenes, the characters with tragic pasts which made me want to encourage them and made me feel connected to them, and the last few episodes which were very intense and made me very nervous are some reasons why I ended up loving this anime. I was very satisfied with the ending, I think the anime was able to end very nicely. The art and songs are also high quality, the opening song did not leave my head for a very long time after watching the anime. Finally, the characters are all unique, each characters act as a different and special spice for the anime. In conclusion, I highly recommend this anime and hope all of you will be able to enjoy this as much as me.\

    Cowboy Bebop is a great gate way anime. The story is very episodic with different scenarios for almost every episode other than the main plot. The story is easy to grasp, so you don't have to watch multiple times to get the gist of it. The story tackles themes of existentialism, identity, and loneliness very well. Animation is very slick and stylish. The soundtrack is the best part of the series. There are many memorable tracks including the ending theme \" The Real Folk Blues\" which I consider the best ending theme to any anime ever. The characters are well developed and we learn more\
          \
        about them as the story moves along. The show can be best summarized as a stylish mix of film noir, space western, and martial arts movies to the backdrop of jazz and blues.\

    STORY: Cowboy Bebop involves episodic moments of a team of intergalactic bounty hunters catching criminals for rewards. It also contains some references and origins/flashbacks of the main characters. There are also a cool action/fighting scenes, but it can be quite comedic too. The show also lets the viewers sees what life in space looks like and the fate of planet Earth.\
CHARACTERS:\
Spike: Bounty Hunter, hates pets, kids and women with attitudes, born in Mars, smoker, lazy and practices martial arts.\
Jet: Former officer, bounty hunter, owner of the Bebop, chef, mechanic and pilot, and has cybernetic body parts.\
Faye: smoker, sarcastic, tough but kind hearted.\
Ein: Corgi, cute and\
          \
        funny, & has a close relationship with Ed.\
Ed: Youngest member in the group, usually talks about herself in third person, intelligent, human, has a close relationship with Ein.\
OVERALL:\
A lot of people have talked about this anime. To be honest, I didn't watch it when it first came out during the 90's (until recently -- since Chris convinced me to watch it with him together). I enjoy the adventures in every episode where the group has to catch bounties of wanted criminals while it contains some backstory of the main characters. They also meet some new characters along the way. If I wanted to make any comments about improvements... I would have to say... MORE opportunities and episodes of the backstories of the main characters. Even though it is nice to see some sub-plots for couple of the main characters, it would be nice if the rest of the characters can get a chance too. I would love to learn more about them. \

    This review isn't going to go into huge detail one why it's a masterpiece that should be evident. I will say the only real problems people commonly find with the show are due to it's age. (clinches/sub par animation, ect) and that's just plain not fair to say that about a 1990's anime.\
When infact those common problems were actually non issues during the time, and infact some would say those problems you didnt like were ground breaking at the time. \

Simply put. If you don't like cowboy bebop, you don't like anime. Im assming most of the dislikes came from people who insist that one\

    TL;DR - The episodic nature that involves different genres is a blessing and a curse, but there is some cohesion between each episode. The characters are full and well-developed and the OST is on another level. Additionally, the show is directed beautifully. Although the age has shown in the art, it still looks good. Watch every episode, but if unsure as to whether to watch to completion, try to watch through at least episode 5. English dub is great, too.\
--Full Review--\
     Cowboy Bebop is lauded by many to be the one of the greatest, if not the greatest, piece of art\
          \
        to come from Japan. This praise does lead to a lot of exaggeration of what it does right and the ignorance of the flaws which are in this piece of work. This is not to take away from what Cowboy Bebop does well. When it is good, you might have to take a moment to appreciate it, but then again, what I enjoyed might not be your cup'o'tea.\
    Cowboy Bebop is episodic in nature, even if the the episodes occur chronologically and a few episodes will recall events of previous episodes. Each episode is a new bounty to collect or a new issue to deal with. There are a few \"two part episodes\", but that is the longest the show presents a continuous event. On top of this, many of the episodes tackle a different theme or concept that seems to be influenced by a western film. An example of this is \"Toys in the Attic\", which is inspired by Alien. This, along with the music selection, makes Cowboy Bebop very friendly for newcomers or the western world.\
     This episodic nature can be a curse and a blessing. While a vast majority of the episodes are extremely well done, there are a few episodes that remain unmemorable. One or two of these are agreed upon, but others are debated largely. This stems from the wide variety of subjects and themes. You might not enjoy \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"Brain Scratch Fever\" simply because you are not a fan of the thriller, mystery genre, but highly enjoy the comedic nature of \"Cowboy Funk\" and \"Mushroom Samba\" instead. The combination of styles and genres leads to biases from the audience, but at the same time guarantees that there is something for everyone to love.\
    However, for a first time watch through, watching every episode is a good idea. They play off of each other very well, and this is part of the reason this show is so highly praised. Each episode fleshes out the crew of the Bebop even more, sometimes causing you to recall previous episodes to see how the character has either changed or remained the same.\
    Additionally, for a first time watcher, I recommend trying to stick it out until you have completed episode 5 \"Ballad of the Fallen Angels\". I have yet to read or hear that someone disliked that episode. The characterization, the action, the music, etc. are all present and done well. I have heard other people say that this is where the show really starts. I do tend to agree, but at the same time, the four episodes previous are all necessary to get the most out of it.\
     Also, the English dub is really well done. Steve Blum as Spike alone makes the English a recommended watch, but all of the other characters are cast with great choices. I have yet to watch the Japanese except through clips, but I have watched it in English multiple times. I'll stick to English on this one. I tend to not have preference in the matter when picking a show to watch, but this one has my vote for English 100% of the time.\
     Now that I got that all out of the way, I'll try to hit the different aspects of the show.\
--Story--(8)\
     The episodic nature does prevent a true over-arching story to unfold through the show, but each episode carries its own unique personality. All of the episodes are well done, but at the same time, there are forgettable episodes. The backstory, however, is well presented for each character, leading up to one of the best endings for a show that I've ever seen.\
--Art--(7)\
     For the age of the show, the artwork has held up. It might not be as clean as modern shows, or as fluid, but it still can be breathtaking. The age shows a bit, but how its held up over the years and the use of shots to help tell the story that is being portrayed is a testament to the show itself.\
--Sound--(10)\
    That the OST for this show is great is practically indisputable. The use of Jazz, Rock, Chorus, and more leads to a beautiful mix of sounds. The OP and ED are also amazing, making it difficult to skip if you tend to do that. Music is also used well throughout the show. It is placed in great moments and really helps get any message across.\
--Enjoyment--(9)\
     This is something that will vary most among people who have watched this show. Certain episodes will appeal more than others. This is something that is unavoidable, however, the show can still be captivating, even during those episodes that you might think that you would be inclined to skip.\

    This series is quite old, and yet no so much; it would seem vintage but it is only an apperance.\
The show itself you might say is progressing quite slowly and yet it would seem to be going in its own pace, not slow yet not brief and taken straight to the point. the combination of the music genre of blues and jass along the show, the lack of many flashy events and effects.. it has only made me to think that all of that was meant to make this a monument the these music genre, slow and quiet yet beautiful.\

    Cowboy Bebop is, amongst my group of peers, THE \"introductory\" anime series. Blending a middle-of-the-road animation style that is at the same time distinctly Japanese, while utilizing many camera angles and lighting techniques that will be familiar to any Western viewer.\
From the bebop-like introduction music to the english vocal actors for the dub (so excellent as to put any non-cartoon watcher at ease) to the main character, Spike to the unique commercial transition scrrens are understandable enough (and more importantly, interesting enough) to make this the perfect bridge into the anime universe. The only thing that I can say as a word of warning is\
          \
        that introducing someone to anime via Bebop (as happened to me) can create unrealistic expectations within the individual, forcing them to scour the internet in search of anime that is comparable in quality.\
What more is there to say? In my mind any and every truly great anime series (and most anime movies) will be held up against Cowboy Bebop for inspection; it is and continues to define what an anime both can be and should be.\

    I have a special place in my heart for this one, Trigun, and Inuyasha because they were all my first anime and that's just how it is. So sorry if this review comes off as biased.\
Characters: My favorite character is Spike not just because he is the main character but because he is so quiet and stoic. I always adore stoic or moody characters (gun x sword -.-) I love his fighting style and his cheesy one liners.\
Faye is another awesome character. She is basically potryaed in a dull way but I love her outfit so much and the hair.\
Edward is a doll and she\

        is another favorite of mine.\
Jet Black is the character that adds in humor and insight and he helps the plot to move because we all know Spike would just lay there forever and ever without someone to push him.\

The plot: Always changed and I like that, that's what keeps the show interesting.\

    Conclusion first so you don't have to scroll:\
You can nitpick all you want to give a lower score to this series; but in the end, compared to what the anime industry is putting out, this show is just leagues better - 16 years old and it STILL is better than 99% of the crap that gets aired every year, and it's not even close.\
Plot:\
People seem to be bothered that there's no overarching \"plot\" to this series, two points on that. First, why would it have one? A former gang member and cop get together to make money, they're not out looking for the galactic leyline\
          \
        - they just need money to eat and pay bills. Second, a \"plot\" in anime is really just an overall goal assigned to the main character while they actually just undergo story arcs; so the only difference between Cowboy Bebop and series with a \"plot\" is that they didn't assign a vague goal to the MC - which is fine since this series has more character development and interesting storylines in its 1-2 episode arcs than most series do over an entire season.\
Characters:\
This show is all about subtlety; it leaves lots of things unsaid, much like in real life - which is one reason why some feel it is all about style, it isn't. There is just so much more to the lead characters than their appearance leads you to believe, they feel human - something I just cannot say about any other anime, characters are either archetype cardboard cutouts or just so over the top that they don't feel real. \
As a small shallow example: the lead is very much OP yet he still gets his ass handed to several times throughout the series, it makes him more credible as a human whereas other MCs either never lose or lose only to learn a lesson that will make them stronger so that they win next time, neither of those cases feel like actual human beings.\
The only disappointments are the antagonists, they just seem evil for no particular reason. \
Oh and the visuals and soundtrack aren't bad either in case you haven't heard.\

Even after 5 years i last watched it i can remember those epic  chasing scenes, the shots, the fights, the problems spike went through. He's an awesome protagonist. \

          \
        is running in the opposite direction, everything can be ripped into pieces in seconds... and the storyline... oh my god the storyline is just so wonderfull it keeps me wondering why it had to end.\

    Cowboy Bebop was a watershed for me . I was 16 years old when I first watched it and I remember how it was a great feeling to watch your episodes and it was sad to watch the last two .\
It is very hard to find animes with such great quality nowadays, whether in history or even in art . I watch animes like Shingeki no Kyojin in and I think, \" What kind of crap is this ? \" . Besides the terrible stories , animations are bad and lazy.\
I had never seen an anime with so much adrenaline and with a dose of\
          \
        perfectionism as big as this anime.\
Influenced by an amount of things, like jazz movement in the early 40's (?), to noir cinema, Nouvelle Vague, philosophy and even religious themes and samurai laws, Cowboy Bebop's animations flow naturally . You do not feel like everything is mechanized or robotic , even when scenes are repeated numerous times to save the work of animators, wich is hard to see in an anime with so much to say and so little time to show.\
And speaking of work, I had never seen a soundtrack as flawless as Cowboy Bebop. A jazz music with influences from rock, pop, classical music and even bossa nova or gypsy music.\
The story is about a group of bounty hunters , as you may already know and is told in \"closed episodes\", which is not very attractive . It was not, it is not and it never will be.\
However , the trump card of the story are it's characters. They are strong and I do not speak of their physical size, but their personalities. None of the characters in Cowboy Bebop are typical anime cliches (like Goku or Luff) , nor are predictable and lacking charisma ( like the characters in Shingeki no Kyojin ), they are striking, original and unpredictable. You never know if Spike will lift your opponent or take shoot him in the middle of his forehead .\
It is no exaggeration to say that Cowboy Bebop is one of the most influential anime of all time, next to Akira, the films of Hayao Miyazaki and, why not , Akira Toriyama ?\
Cowboy Bebop opened Western's eyes to action animes, aimed at an older audience, who were satisfied with comics like Sandman, Allan Moore's comics and among others, and influenced all sectors of our artistic side of the world, since cinema, to comics, music and even literature.\
You can find influences from Cowboy Bebop in mainstream films such as Tarantino and Matrix, to underground artists like Dawn of Midi and even King Krule .\
Sure Cowboy Bebop was also very influenced ( Lupin III and the movement of jazz are just some of the more obvious influences), but it was the mastery in uniting all these references (musical, artistic, visual, literary, phylosophical and religious) that make this anime the best anime of all times , in the humble opinion of this fan .",

    Cowboy Bebop is a show that I can best describe as an anime that dares to mix genres. On the surface it looks like your typical Space Western, but once you delve into the real meat of the show you will find everything from romance, action, comedy, philosophical themes and spirituality. The fact that the show manages to round so many corners in its 26 episodes, while still stringing together a coherent story, supplemented by an amazing cast of colourful characters, with heroes, villains and everything in between, makes it one of the most enjoyable anime I have seen in my entire life.\
Cowboy Bebop is\
          \
        an episodic anime. Each new episodes deal with a new story, with the exception of the character driven episodes scattered in between, that sometimes span over several episodes. The actual plotline is solid and engaging, leaving you hungering for more answers every time you learn a little more about one of the characters. It is the life that these characters have lead up until the point where the viewer meets them, that really help flesh them out and stop them from becoming one-dimensional stereotypes.\
The artstyle in Cowboy Bebop is detailed, creative and fitting. Mostly dull metal and earth tones are mixed with neon colours and really help drive home the feeling of both the loneliness and grandeur that can be experienced in a galactic spanning civilization. One episode you might find yourself in the dusty streets of a Martian colony, the next in a colourful floating casino located in orbit around a planet.\
The soundtrack is one of the many high points of Cowboy Bebop. Everything from tribalistic drumbeats to snazzy jazz tunes and even modern electronic music are to be found within the series and all of them help set the mood perfectly. In an anime that is as broad as Cowboy Bebop, a good musical score is immensely helpful in setting each episode apart from another and Yoko Kanno has done a fantastic job.\
Now I will touch upon the characters of Cowboy Bebop, who in my opinion are what ultimately manages to carry this show into near perfection. The calm and collected Spike Spiegel, the grumpy and life-hardened Jet Black, the seductive and devious Faye Valentine, along with resident nutball \"Ed\" and her hyper-intelligent laboratory dog \"Ein\" make up the main cast of the show. Every single one of these characters have a story to tell and they are all interesting, action-packed and in some cases, heart-breaking.\
These characters come together as Bounty Hunters in an attempt to escape the ghosts of their past. Most importantly the show doesn't forget about this. These characters aren't your typical goodie two-shoed heroes. Ultimately they are in it for the money and while they do have a working moral compass, they aren't shy when it comes to getting their hands dirty.\
Overall Cowboy Bebop provided some of the most entertaining episodes of a TV-series I have ever had the joy of experiencing. Some episodes more suspenseful and thrilling than others of course, but all of them can hold their own and is almost guaranteed to provide constant entertainment.\
Unfortunately I cannot give this show a full score across the board. The show does deal with some clichés that at times are a little bit uniteresting, not to mention that with the episodic build-up, some of the less relevant episodes can end up feeling redundant at times. Still very much entertaining, but not really adding anything to the characters or the story and while they are very, very few, they are there.\
That being said, Cowboy Bebop is rock-solid from start to finish and raises the bar in terms of soundtrack and characters, earning it a fantastic 10/10.\

    Cowboy Bebop is an unusual series. Many of the episodes were meaningless, with only senseless action in them, which I found boring. However there were episodes that were full of thrill and developed the characters greatly. \
For starters, at about episode 12 is that the series turns EXTREMELY INTERESTING. In each episode after that one the series becomes more enjoyable. The character development is GREATLY done. How each character learns more about each others' past and this makes them closer to each other; THAT is what I mostly liked about the series. \
However, I found that the series had many episodes that were literally pointless;\
          \
        just meaningless \"bounty hunting\" that involved looking up information of someone and than going out and capturing them-- which they usually failed. These episodes had no plot and no character development what so ever. episodes some of the episodes from 1 through 11 are just that-- pointless bounty hunting-- except the episodes where they meet Vicious, Faye and Ed. \
\
The characters were very enjoyable, but they left somethings out that could have been made clearer. I, personally, thought that the ending could have been better. But overall, this was an enjoyable anime, EXCEPT for the ending, did not like it.....       \

    Cowboy Bebop, it's really my first anime (if I don't include Pokémon, my awareness of anime was zerozerozero when I was 10 or so). And I loved every second of it. You should just watch it for the amazing music, and then realise: wow, it's just a great series.\
The story: Well, it is about a handsome man-in-suit, Spike Spiegel, who has to settle something with his former-friend Vicious; and of course, it's about a woman. But don't think: Aw, again one of those shallow crappy animes! Did I tell you it is set in the future? I never really liked all those machinie-space-let'sliveonotherplanets-thingies. Cowboy Bebop\
          \
        is somewhat different, although I can't explain it very well. \
The art: This is not the best drawn anime ever, I can name 10 other anime whose art is better and such, but it fits the series. The universe-stuff with all the flying vehicles it pretty realistic and the fights are nice.\
The music: Aahh, the music. Yoko Kanno is a real music genius. There are sad melodies, but also very funky, jazzy themes. Especially jazz.\
The characters: You get every one of them. Spike, the cool, laid-back man, who'll do everything for the woman he loves.'\
Jet, the caring, robotarm, former-policeman.\
Faye, the pretty woman with a huge debt, oh yeah, she's howmanyyears?\
Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky the fourth, a weird, young, female computer hacking genius.\
And last but not least, Ein! The cute data-dog n____n\

    Well, it's official.  Cowboy Bebop is the greatest anime series of all time.  Well, ok, that may be a bit of a hyperbole, but not much of one.  It has a legendary status that the latest shonen idiot-fest, the most popular shojo pretty-boy romp, or even series' like Death Note or Code Geass can never hope to achieve.  If you like anime, you've at least watched Cowboy Bebop.  If you haven't, what the hell are you waiting for?  Even if you don't end up liking it (despite my gushing about it, it can be a real love it or\
          \
        hate it thing), you should at least give it a watch once in your life.\
This show has also had a massive impact on the anime industry.  Various members of the production team for this show banded together to form a little studio named Bones.  They're the masterminds behind not only the Cowboy Bebop movie, but also Wolf's Rain, RahXephon, Eureka Seven, Ouran High School Host Club, and of course Fullmetal Alchemist (as well as the direct manga adaptation, FMA Brotherhood).  Yes, both of the FMA anime were made possible because of Bebop.\
I'd go into depths of why it's so good, but it's been beaten to death and beyond.  Suffice it to say that the story is wonderful, the characters are some of the best and most memorable ever, the animation is flawless, the English dub is ridiculously awesome, and the music is done by Yoko Kanno (no explanation needed).  If I can think of one flaw, it's that the episodes Wild Horses and Boogie Woogie Feng Shui are pretty weak in comparison to the rest of the series, which is bizarre considering that interspersed between those two are Pierrot le Fou and Cowboy Funk, two of the strongest episodes in the series (ESPECIALLY Cowboy Funk).  Other than that though, you should definitely check this one out.\

    If you analyze the series in a completely analytical way, you might find certain segments that might bother you from time to time (for instance, the main plot might seem to get lost here and there thus resulting in episodes that might seem as unnecessary fillers, the music through the anime is good, but I've seen anime with much better soundtracks etc.) which is why there are some people who legitimately pose the question \"what's the big fuss about this anime?\".\
But here is the catch, like all things, this anime is more than just the sum of all its parts. In fact, as I watched\
          \
        it I enjoyed it to a fair amount and would give it a 8 or 9/10. But then one afternoon I sat down and looked at the last few episodes and I was stunned. Somehow everything came together and the entire series got such amazing depth and meaning, as well as the characters in it.\
It amazes me how their creators could pull such an extravagant array of topics and genres and glue them all together in an incredible fashion. Action, drama, sci-fi, comedy,thriller, adventure, detective story, gangster, horror... you got them all here, and brilliantly executed and connected.\
The soundtrack is another thing that worths mentioning. It is absolutely superb. Jazz, Blues, Rock, Country, Electronic, Ballads... an all American array of music. As many, many other cultural reference to USA.\
This surely is one of the best anime I've seen with one of the most memorable characters you can sympathize with on different levels and, in my eyes at least, has the BEST ending I have ever seen in my life. Perfect, perfect, perfect.\

    A good anime has three things: well choreographed bloody fights, laugh-your-ass-off comedy, and heart-wrenching, tear-jearking emotion. Cowboy Bebop has all of them in godlike proportions.\
It has a bit of a slow start; not all of the main characters are introduced in the first episode. Also, all episodes bar about 9 are fillers, or not essential to the overall story. However, this is where all the comedy comes from, and the fillers make for a nice break in-between the gripping storyline.\
The characters are fairly basic, but all have their own intricate past which is revealed at various points throughout the anime. This makes you feel like,\
          \
        once you start watching you can't stop, you need to know what happens next.\
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, almost solely for the three reasons mentioned above. Watch it. You won't regret it. And, being only 26 episodes long, it won't take you ages and ages to get finished.\

    I really wish I seen this series years ago. Ok! so this is my first review for MAL but this amazing anime is worthy of my written opinion. I love how Bebop through each episode feels like a different genre each time, it a journey a adventure that honestly needs no big plot. Just a story of four individuals who so happenly come together\
they each have some kind of past. The series has fantastic action, beautiful and a legendary ost from the lovely Miss Yoko Kano to beat. In my opinion this is the second best series I ever seen the eptiome of anime .\

    This Review is out of 100. 35/100 for Story, 35/100 for Characters, 15/100 for Sound, 15/100 for Animation. \
Story - 31/35 - Where to start. The story is very good. Most episodes are separate from each other, so you can watch the series in mostly any order. It makes it easy to jump right into an episode without having to watch other ones. Each episode feels like it's a different genre from the last, with some being action packed, other being lighthearted and funny, while others a really serious. A lot of diversity here, which makes it an almost universal show. The central plot has\
          \
        to do mostly with Spike and his past, although the other characters get their time in the limelight too. My only complaint is how the cast even after splitting up always seem to find each other in the end. They can travel the whole solar system, so it's a coincidence that happens a tad too often.  Lastly, this show has such an amazing ending that you can't help but love.\
Characters - 34/35 - One of the best cast of characters you could ask for. They all just work so well together, and a very fun to watch. Spike in particular is very cool, and is probably the single coolest character in all of anime. The rest of the cast aren't slouches either, as they all have their good points. Even though we do learn a lot about their past and see them form a relationship with each other, I can't help but feel there is more to tell for each of them. The side characters are also very good, as is the main villain. \
Sound - 15/15 - Arguably the best soundtrack in any show ever. I really love the score from this show, from its iconic opening, to all the jazz spread through the show, to the ending. Each episode has a specific genre associated to it, and it's cool to see the music change along with the episode. Also, it's probably the best example of English used properly in anime, and sounding VERY good and NOT like it's a separate language. \
As you probably know, the dub for this show is phenomenal, and should be watched over the sub. Even if you are a sub purist, watch this show dubbed. \
Animation - 13/15 - The best of the best for its time. Sadly, its time was 1999, which was a while ago. It still looks beautiful and has very fluid movements, but it is still older. \
Overall - 93/100 - Damn this was a good show. Easily one of the best I have ever seen, and one everybody should see. Don't miss this show. \

    First off Cowboy Bebop isn't an anime that really needs a review; its success says it all. No matter what you might think about it just hearing about it, this anime really draws you in with its characters and holds you firmly planted in front of your viewing device. Its cleverly placed comedic moments perfectly balance out the overall seriousness of the situations. Its full of action while still having the occasional bit of crack that we all love. In the end, its an anime I would recommend for every fan to watch as a classic of what makes a good anime.\

    Cowboy Bebop is a quite simplistic series. There's an overarching plot in there, but mostly it's an episodic series that starts the first couple of episodes setting up some plot points, spending an episode in the middle bringing it up again (so you don't forget, I guess) and in the final episode it all comes to a close. The rest of the episodes are basically you following the crew on their adventures and getting to know them a bit more.\
Normally, this would be a problem for me. This series, albeit short with only 26 episodes, is like Naruto on steroids. If you decided to skip\
          \
        the episodes that have nothing to do with the set up plot, you would have an anime of about six episodes. However, it's the simplicity of Cowboy Bebop that makes this somehow work. It's not 500 episodes long, which makes me... not mind it at all, so to speak. In fact, it does the job like a charm.\
The cast is nice and compact, with only four characters to focus on, which the series does a good job of fleshing out. At the end of the series, I found myself not really having a favourite character, in the sense that every character was nicely balanced out and all just as likable as the other.\
My biggest praise goes to the sound design. This series does sound REALLY well. It's a pretty quiet series, featuring sound effects and voice acting mostly. Only on selected occasions are you treated by the series' outstanding music.\
In the 23 years long life I've led until now, I never was very big on anime. Sure, I grew up with Pokemon, but that was really about it. Really, this is like my first serious anime. My indifference towards anime completely changed after having finished Cowboy Bebop. It's the first anime I watched from start to end, in about a week or so, and I'm planning to watch many more anime in the future.\
Cowboy Bebop is amazing in all its simplicity. It's a mature tale, with nothing too grand and epic. Definitely would watch again.\

Soundtrack (10/10)\
The Ost is the best of all, this gave so much strenght to every single cap, yoko kanno is a real op, and is so hard not to listen to this ost all day long. \
Story (9/10) \
Even that the story is not the best of all time, the director which is amazing ( Shinichiro Watanabe) make this anime a completed delight to the eyes, is so powerfull, the drama or the action, even the funny eps were flawless ... every single ep was so unique. i can not forget the\
          \
        \"Ballad of the fallen angels\" . \
Characters ( 10/ 10)\
Cowboy bebop has the most particular characters i ever seen, is not a cliché like nowadays that all of them can be easily put in one of the \"dere\" types yandere tsundere and so on that are so boring. Spike, Faye and even the dog are so cool. \
Art (10/10)\
This is what i called a good 90 anime, the colors and the backgrouds, everything was take into detail, the character desing is so mature, love it. \

This anime is for people who wants to get a rollercoaster of emotions and enjoy a great direction wich the best soundtrack ever ! \

    Cowboy Bebop is outstanding in every way. The only aspect it fell even a little short on was characters, but it was practically unnoticeable. The premise is a fantasy that I'm sure many people had wished were real since the discovery of other planets. The premise of humanity colonizing other planets in the solar system and bounty hunters roam the seas of space to catch criminals opens itself to a plentiful amount of settings to place your characters. Paired with it's stunning art that'll be sure to hold up forever, the plot and setting never cease to amaze the eyes. The sound in this show\
          \
        is astounding. With it's classic opening, Tank, and it's jazzy soundtrack. It's simply like candy for the ears. Now here's what I was saying before on falling flat somewhere. The characters in this show don't go as far as they could've. But that doesn't mean that they aren't still great. They're still charming, lovable, and leave an emotional attachment even after finishing watching. This sets up one specific part of the show that still hangs with me and will continue to hang with me as long as I remember the name \"Cowboy Bebop.\" This'll contain a spoiler, but i'm not sure how anyone hasn't finished Cowboy Bebop yet or had this spoiled for them yet. Skip to this \
\"--\" mark for when the spoiler ends. My favorite and at the same time least favorite part of this show is when Spike dies. His death is set up all too perfectly that I hate whoever sat down and wrote it. The entire show made us become attached to Spike to the point that I even felt like he was a close friend. So when he passed in the ending, it dug deep. It does it even better with how it's timed too. With a couple episodes of build up to Spike confronting his past. It slowly sinks into you that Spike is not going to come back. The characters in the show also slowly come to terms with this as well as they say their last goodbyes to Spike when they never wanted to part in the first place. Everyone that knew Spike(except Ed and Ein) know that someone they never thought they'd become close with is leaving in such a cruel way. Then to top it all off, the show ends on a shot of Spike's smile as he lies on the ground lifeless with the final words appearing on the screen. \"You're gonna carry that weight\" Powerful words that'll stick forever. -- Cowboy Bebop is a ride of fun, action, and lovable characters. It honestly does deserve it's crown that the fans gave it. There isn't a single person who shouldn't watch this show, even if they somehow don't like it. This show rightfully deserves a 10. That's about it. Until next time, see you space cowboy.\

    Cowboy Bebop. Cowboy Bebop. Cowboy Bebop. If there was any anime that I heard such raving reviews about more than Cowboy Bebop, I don't know what it is. People were telling me right and left that Bebop was the best anime ever. So, I finally had to check it out. I did. And my final opinion: it was really good. It is pretty easy, though, for me to write my likes and dislikes about the show. First, dislikes, I'll just get it over with. The episodic nature of the show. I have never really been a fan of episodic shows, sure they add great character\
          \
        development to the show, but I have a sense of longing, waiting for something, like the story, that never comes, or doesn't satisfy me. Though now that I understand the show much more, especially the themes of longing and alienation, it is fitting that a show sort of holds the viewer to the same expectations as the characters. Something that has made me love the show even more.\
Now, here comes what I liked about the show. The characters and the music. If I loved anything about Cowboy Bebop, it was the music. The intro song, Tank!, does exactly what I think an intro should do: get the viewer excited to watch each episode, which it did and more. The outro, on the other hand, The Real Folk Blues, does exactly the opposite. It is filled with a sense of melancholy and longing, which was also perfect. After a couple episodes I felt the loneliness of many of the characters and the outro perfectly captured my emotions. I was so impressed by the music that I looked up who was in charge of it, Yoko Kanno, and I just wanted to give her all the praise in the world. The last time I heard a soundtrack so amazing was after Silent Hill 2. It was that great. \
The characters also make Cowboy Bebop what it is. Spike, Jet, Faye and Edward (you too, Ein!) were a joy to adventure with. They each had drastically different personalities, something I love, and had their own interesting stories to tell. Learning their back stories was like a punch in the gut and made me fall for each character even more. \
All and all, Cowboy Bebop is a show that deserves all the praise it gets. I don't hold onto this show maybe the same way that others do, but I admire and respect its craft. I'm sure after more time has passed and I rewatch it a couple more times, I will love it as much as some others do but until then ...  See You Space Cowboy. \

    This anime will always have a top spot among GAOAT (Greatest Anime of All Time). Some of the reasons why are clear... a very gripping set of sub plots in each episode that sometimes linger on to the next episode and sometimes are not seen to have lasting effects in the character development. Part of this lack of roll-over into characterization adds a mysteriousness to the tone of anime. This is one of the main reasons why Cowboy Bebop will forever remain in anime watchers' hearts. An amazingly crafted overall tone that intertwines with the plot, leaves strikingly unique characters that in our present day\
          \
        are imitated by cos-players regularly. \
The themes in the anime were not that of minor ideologies, but delivered strong themes that could cause drastic changes in people's lives. I couldn't imagine that this anime has not changed many peoples' lives in regards to how they think about life. The creativity for the sub-plots is congruent to an author's dream to write a whole book that would inspire readers. But Cowboy Bebop is able to deliver stories of similar impact in a single episode. All this is done in a futuristic world with old-school animation where the ideas for technologies and methods of doing daily tasks requires true creative genius.\
Returning to the reason why Cowboy Bebop is so influential, a single reason cannot actually explain its impact, but a good watch of the anime should be able to do the trick. heh.\

    Cowboy Bebop is, essentially, an American-style \"Western.\" Set in Space. To an awesome and varied soundtrack, as our anti-heroes bebop around the solar system, from the moon of Saturn to the clouds of Venus, collecting bounties on various criminals, trying to avoid their various troubled and mysterious pasts.\
But...\
There's a lot of tropes and stereotypes played with masterfully, ironically, humorously, and, strangely enough, straightly, throughout the series, blending East-Meets-West in a delectable fusion not unlike it's outstanding soundtrack.\
Blues; Jazz; Rock; Western; Classical; the list goes on-and-on, each \"style\" represented and counterpointed by its particular episode.\
Science Fiction. Comedy. Drama. Action/Adventure. Cowboy Bebop has something for everyone. And,\
          \
        unlike most series that tries to be \"everything for everyone,\" Cowboy Bebop somehow manages to succeed.\
Watching Cowboy Bebop is only half the experience; listening is as much a part of the pleasure. Like putting on your headphones and cuing up your favorite playlist of various styles of music, and letting each piece pull your emotions this-way-and-then-that, until at the end, you're satisfied and yet strangely melancholy; you've laughed, you've cried, you've reminisced fondly in turn.\
That's Cowboy Bebop.\

    Cowboy Bebop was really one of the first 'good' animes I watched right after Gurren Lagann.  And it truly influenced a generation of anime, as well as people.  The story is interesting and involves the pasts of all of the main characters.  The music (composed by Yoko Kanno, one of my favorite artists) is amazing and complements the style of anime that the developers wanted to achieve.  \
The art style and graphics are amazing for the time it was made in.  I still love watching the fighting scenes, because they are done so beautifully.  \
Overall, Cowboy Bebop has many\
          \
        cultural references, as well as literary references that make the series interesting and intelligent at the same time, which few animes today succeed at.\
By far the best anime I have ever watched.\

    I heard about this anime a long ways back from several people all saying it was good. It wasn't like I doubted them but I just couldn't bring myself to watch a show called 'Cowboy Bebop'... Well I eventually gave in (must be about 10 years later) and I have just finished watching the series.\
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. Just about every episodes is a fun and exciting watch with a bit of comedy here and there.\
I wouldn't say there is any overall story to this anime but each character has his/her own story going on and we learn a little about each throughout the\
          \
        series, but never really dive deep into any of them apart from perhaps Spike. Spike reminded me alot of Mugen from Samurai Champloo - his looks, his attitude, highly skilled fighter etc so I think I enjoyed his character and story the most. Again it didn't go very deep into his story/past but it didn't really need to, to be enjoyed.\
All the characters have their quirky little traits that make them all the more loveable and entertaining to see in various situations.\
The English dub is not as cringe worthy as most anime I have seen but its still pretty horrible IMO. I dont think the voice for any of the characters in the English dub suited them at all after having watched it in Japanese.\
The art work and animation is decent considering its age. Its nothing spectacular but it does the job and fits the general feel of everything being a bit rough and only just maintained to a working condition. The action scenes are great with some cool fights, gunfights and space battles. Most of which are fairly fast paced but easy to follow.\
This is definitely one to tick off the list. Don't worry about how old it is - you will enjoy it!\

    Well first of all the most memorable thing about 'cowboy bebop' was the opening song witch was just epic. Considering that it was released in 1998 it is a really great anime. Interesting characters with various ideas and past. It didn't take too long to watch since the plot is interesting yet simple. Also why it was interesting to watch is because the main characters weren't over power considering other side characters and everything didn't just go their way. It was funny serious and had action and when everything combines it is just a great creation. The music selected for different scenes were selected perfectly\
          \
        in my opinion.\

    I'm still trying to get a full and complete understanding of everything under the umbrella of existentialism, but in the meantime here's my review of Cowboy Bebop. Throughout the summer I had been watching some mediocre anime, and I was in somewhat of a slump in terms of enjoyment. It may have been from a lack of philosophy or really enjoyable plot, but after being in such a slump, Cowboy Bebop was a breath of fresh air. I don't normally enjoy(and would almost borderline say that nothing pisses me off more than) episodic anime, but despite some personal issues with the way it ran and\
          \
        its formula, Cowboy Bebop overall was a really enjoyable show. The show stands out amid a lot of anime and is aimed at western audiences and feels a bit like the musical Chicago mixed with Star Wars if Spike Spiegel himself kicked John Williams in the nads and told him to rewrite the music into jazz and told George Lucas to stop making prequels. So first, the technical stuff of the show is understandable given the shows age, but also stood out in some brilliant ways. To my knowledge, Cowboy Bebop was made in the 90's so the animation is good, but does look aged by today's standards. However in terms of the bells and whistles of the show, the music (OH THE MUSIC) was what really stood out in terms of what made the show \"pop\" I guess.On top of all the technical aesthetics, the characters and life contemplation dialogue were really the draw for me AND the best parts of the show. Each character has a ton of personality, and while each of their backstories aren't completely delivered or are delivered at somewhat of a sloppy pace, Spike, Jet, Ed, and Faye's diverse presences all add a little flavor of their own to the crew and the show in general. Their personalities are realistic, as each crew member of the Bebop is based on past actions and consequences, and this is the recurring and underlying theme throughout the whole show; the past and its effect on the present and future. The situations they are put in vary too, from hunting bounties, looking at their pasts or fighting old food makes the show somewhat of a grab bag feel. On one hand it's great because it lets the viewer wander into the wonders that science fiction holds (especially the episodes about computer hacking, saving the rat-fish things, and the one about the out of body A.I. religion). It's good because episode plots and focuses may be different, but it's a formula that didn't quite click with me. While each episode is enjoyable, I wasn't left with a sense of accomplishment after every single one. You never see what the characters do with the money they get from bounties and in some of the situations if feels like they should learn something and grow a bit from their adventures, but while having personality, all the characters are surprisingly static throughout the course of the show. The lack of character development is a personal gripe but given the fact that it's a show about holding onto the past as a main theme, I felt a little jipped. The episodic nature of the show made it hard to relate to Julia, Spike and Vicious' relationships because the show didn't focus on it quite enough and just kinda teased me with it at the beginning and crammed it in just to resolve it during the last couple episodes. The whole Red Dragon Syndicate subplot felt like it should have been touched on more since it was such an important part of the show. My final gripe with it is if the show is that the setting was fascinating, but the ruined planet Earth and the cramped urban space cities could have had more of a message of humanity's past about it. The entire solar system being the way it was is a fascinating concept, but was just kinda shoved in the corner and never fully got to shine, and I really wanted it to. But while those might seem like personal problems, the show also affected me personally. At times, the show makes you think about your own life with its themes and even sweetly pokes at the soul. Seriously my eyes got a little watery during Ed and Ein's final scene. So despite some issues that the show may have, a lot of the entertainment value is held in the ragtag crew's personal issues and how they get through the struggles presented in each episode. So I'd recommend this anime more for the adult crowd and science ficiton lovers because of it's deep content, and I gotta say I was really impressed overall. See you space cowboy.\

    Even in the future, you can't outrun your past. This is the best anime ever created. Sure it's funny and loaded with fantastic action sequences, but you can say that about many series. This stands well above the rest because the story arc is rich and nuanced, with many-layered characters fully inhabiting an interesting and well-developed universe. There is greater depth, sophistication, and development in this ad hoc family of wounded loners (Spike, Jet and Faye) than there is most live-action work, never mind animation. Hell, the supporting cast is populated with characters with more history and complexity than the leads in some series. Complex\
          \
        relationships, affections, and allegiances unfold over 26 episodes, and there is a beautiful symmetry in the construction as the characters individual stories are unpacked like nested dolls. The artwork is dark, distinctive, and evocative. It is not always as smooth in some respects as some contemporary animation, but given the obsessive attention to detail the creators demonstrated I believe this is a conscious choice. No element of the production is haphazard; each element is part of an integrated whole. Even the stand-alone episodes which could be seen as irrelevant to the overall plot are ultimately connected (Consider the ghost story Toys in the Attic, which, when examined, revolves around an old decision by Spike which comes back to threaten him and everyone around him, and which he must face alone). The sound-track is a genre-bending tour de force by Yoko Kano and holds its own as an OST box-set. The English dub is among the best and loses nothing over the Japanese. The series is haunting, bittersweet, and rewarding. Episodes 25 and 26 comprise the most powerful hour of animation ever. Period. Some people might not like the genre, or might not dig the story, but you can't deny the exceptional quality here. No serious anime fan can ignore Bebop.\

There are many reasons why this is one of my favorites. Spike had many enlightening points that he makes that causes an impact on your way of thinking. Ed and Ein shaved off a sliver of my heart when she says 'Father persons gone.'\

    This show is truly a one-of-a-kind masterpiece. Its entire story is so unique, with each character with a different background story and fate, along with each episode that's about something really different and never having the same old story like most anime shows have. It's even one of the very few shows that actually has a terrific soundtrack. It gotten me into jazz and now I'm a fan of the Seatbelts. Cowboy Bebop and its legacy always keeps my eye caught for it's such a classic.\
Each character has a different personality: from a laid-back, karate artist to a seductive gambler to a genius teenager and\
          \
        more! Each episode has a different story: from chess to metal to tragedy, whatever! What I love about the anime is that it does have a love story behind it, but it's not full-out predictable and it doesn't flood the show, unlike other animes.\
I also feel connection to the show, especially Spike, since he reminds me so much of myself: laid back, mellow, yet independent, stubborn and sometimes lazy. Even the story about Spike's eyes; it's incredibly personal to me.\
If you're looking for a complete unique show with things you've never seen before, then this show is for you! Highly recommended!\

    When Cowboy Bebop was first showed in the US in 2001 it changed anime in the United States forever. Cowboy Bebop is about 3 bounty hunters, 1 girl, and 1 very smart dog. They go to planet to planet hunting for bountys and getting paid. Cowboy Bebop is a very well writen show and has some great voice acting.\
Cowboy Bebop is sometimes very funny, funny, or it trys to be funny and fails. The main characters are very well drawn and voiced. The main characters are Spike and Jet. The show gets places most of time in space. The show has some very good action\
          \
        moments and has good music.\
If you aren't careful, you'll miss the puns riddled throughout this lively space odyssey paired with a collection of music that is sure to captivate your auricles. The cast of characters the show focuses on are not unlike vinaigrette. Their personalities and background are unmistakably distinct from each other, but when things get shaken up, their styles blend together and compliment the other nicely, making a sensational taste. Enough with the metaphors and puns already! There's plenty of action to keep you interested until the end. The plot is wonderfully written. And there's even a nice subtle love interest to appeal to both genders. I urge you to watch this artsy collaboration for yourself. Enjoy the artwork but also listen closely to the messages within. Either way, you are bound to like what you are about to see.\

What i mean by that is and im one of those people , when an anime becomes so main stream , so flushed all over the place i tend to hate on it just because people who don't really watch anime will defend to the grave.\

          \
        out. It has one of the best soundtracks of any anime , really nice art style , and probably the only acceptable anime to be dubbed.\

    Cowboy Bebop is one of those anomalies that transcended the norm; it wasn't popular in Japan initially but was a big hit in the Western world, it paid alot of homage towards its' Western influence & it was slightly more realistically mature.\
When I say \"realistically mature\", what do I mean? We've had mature themed anime in the past (Macross, Ghost In The Shell, Akira) but Cowboy Bebop was one of the first, to me, that was set grounded in real life. Even with the fancy new toys and futuristic setting, it was essentially a love triangle that has gone wrong.\
It was Spike, Vicious, & Julia\
          \
        show and everyone was just tagging along for the ride.\
I'm pretty sure most of the points, good or bad, I can discuss have been pointed beforehand, and much more eloquently than I would so I would just like to leave some parting words.\
If you like space westerns, space operas, cyberpunk, great action scenes, awesome dogfights or a really mature premise; then this is the anime for you. If not, check it out anyways. :)\

    Back when I was 110 years old, someone had introduced me to this anime while I was just getting into anime, using it as an excuse for my doctors to not cut off my medical insurance, since I now had a reason to live. Anyway, this anime is brilliant from start to finish. Spike Spiegal (the main character) is one of the greatest anime characters ever created, with his amazing back story, and his cool laid back demeanor when it comes to fighting or collecting bounties. He is supported by Jet Black, a former ISSP cop named the \"Black Dog\", or whatever you'd like to\
          \
        call him, Faye Valentine, a 77 year old bounty hunter with a gambling addiction who has a debt that can can make the U.S national debt look like a fucking joke compared to what she's lost, and Edward, a 13 year old computer hacker who hasn't even heard of the use of socks and shoes in her or his or (fuck even the dad doesn't know the sex) lifetime. \
The story in this series is superb. A few episodes focuses on Spike's past with the Red Dragon Syndicate and his rival Vicious, and girlfriend Julia. Each of these episodes leads up the epic conclusion of the series, which to this day is considered one of the best anime endings of all time. There are also episodes that focus on the other supporting casts, such as their backstorys or involvement with major issues related to the plot. \
The soundtrack is also superb (screw you I like using superb) with music that beats the crap out of 90 percent of anime today. Just listening to the opening them \"Tank\" reminds me of the good times I had with my ex-wife back in the Jazz age, until she jumped off a bridge when I realized she was stealing money from my bank account. But anyways, if you haven't listened to it or have, you should definantly go buy it, since it's worth evey penny of your useless life.\
The animation is also outstanding, with it's lighting and visual backgrounds, such as downtown environments on different planets struck by the poverty bug. It is made to look more realistic and eye popping than my birthday records.\
Overall I would reccommend this to anyone, a current anime watcher who hasn't seen it, or a newbie into the anime community.\

    I know it's overrated.  I really do.  However while comparing Gandhi to Jesus might be overrating him (don't take this any way as other than an objective example) he's still damn near a perfect 10 in his own right.\
As far as story goes, it's amazing.  A little contrived, perhaps regarding some tropes here and there, but god dammit it's executed fantastically.  The wealth of western references and culture elements in the show also give it a very, VERY distinct feel and atmosphere when compared to other anime.  \
Art:  FanfreakingTASTIC.  Gorgeously dirty urban environments, this grizzled and heavily stylized\
          \
        and lanky feel and a look that pretty much just screams blues/jazz is one of the best styles of animation I've ever seen.\
Sound:  Holy hell the music...  The bluesy guitar and harmonica pieces, the jazz-influenced background music and fight soundtracks and the slow, somber closing piece by Yoko Kanno add up to, in my opinion, one of the greatest and most unique soundtracks ever.  Some might argue that there's some resemblance to Western themed music, and there is, however it's not overly similar to the point of feeling contrived.  Sound effects had a nice '80s movie feel to them, further adding to the atmosphere.\
Character:  Amazingly interesting characters, definitely all unforgettable in my opinion.  Even the dog...  Characters were developed and fleshed out very nicely through to the very end.  \
Enjoyment:  Sometimes it felt boring, but it was as I was thinking to myself how bored I was that I realized that the characters were also bored, themselves.  It captures the atmosphere of being a badass bounty hunter in a space-western styled world fantastically, and the fight scenes as well as the wealth of comedy made for an excellent and fun experience.\
Overall this is a 10.  Yes, it has its shortcomings no doubt, but all in all I'd say it still makes up for them.  I'll defend to the best of my ability my decision in giving it a 10, but if you think it wasn't that great for whatever legitimate reason then that's fine.  I will openly admit that I was utterly sucked in by this anime to the point of no longer being able to view it wholly objectively, thus biasing my opinion.\
Still, had that not been the case, I doubt I would've given it lower than an 8.5. It's fantastic, and should be watched by all.\

    I was drawned to Cowboy Bebop by a Firefly podcast. There is something about space cowboys that I love. Bebop doesn't have a linear storyline it's more about the misadventures of a rag tag crew that is drawn together by there love of money and adventure.  There were no villains per say just 'bounties' they tried to capture each episode. One of the things I loved about this series were the characters. They were each unique and very flawed but seemed to care about each other though they would never admit it. Each had a background, that we got to see. Ed the non\

        sequitur, androgynous, young member of the crew was much like River from Firefly. Spike the anti hero is too cool for school. Faye the femme fatale brought sexy to the series and a little girl power. Jet the gruff old goat would bring his sage advice to the crew, even though they never wanted it. Ein the 'smart dog' rounded out the crew. The action was good and there was plenty of gun slinging like in old westerns. There were even a couple of duels at dust. What stood out to me was the soundtrack. It was a great jazzy mix. The downside to this series was that there wasn't really an ending no one road out in the sunset. Cowboy Bebop was my first anime and I really enjoyed it. \

    Stand alone episodes with the right pacing and fluid character development are very re-watchable. I have re-watched Cowboy Bebop dozens of times and it never gets old. It can't. The art is too damn good. The music is too damn good. The character development is fluid though the story isn't serialized. And as far as the story goes, it is outstanding. Based on the characters, each main story segment follows Spike's past. Each of the characters get their episodes to uncover more and more about their pasts. Spike's is definitely the most deep, though you don't get to uncover it all, I think the restraint\

        in telling all about all the characters' pasts is Cowboy Bebop's greatest strength. I've re-watched Cowboy Bebop dozens of times and it never gets old.

    A lot of people think Cowboy Bebop is the greatest anime ever made. There is quite a simple reason why that is, and that's because it's almost objectively true. Even if you don't agree with that, which some of you might after completing the show, it's a fact that Cowboy Bebop with all its iconic-ness and themes has become one of the most influential pieces of not only Japanese visual media, but even worldwide. I will keep this as short as possible, and will refrain from using any spoilers (except for vague descriptions of the general themes, and opinions/emotions regarding events that happen late in\
          \
        the series. I WILL NOT describe those events in any way, shape or form, so be calm). This is my first review, so feedback would be appreciated.\
STORY - 8/10\
For promotional purposes, the series' creative director Shinichiro Watanabe said in the initial presentation that Cowboy Bebop would be \"A new genre unto itself\". Why he said so becomes apparent to anyone that watches the series past episode 1, where it becomes apparent that the show really can't be categorised under a single genre. It pulls inspiration from so many different visual media that it almost literally becomes a new genre. It has themes from genres like western, science-fiction, crime, mafia, romance, post-apocalyptic, even a bit of horror, and the list goes on. There even are a few homages to popular western media (like one that I especially adored somewhere in the middle of the series, which I won't spoil, but it has a hilarious conclusion). Anyway, all I'm saying is, it will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and most important of all, it will make you watch the series to the end.\
 The plot takes place in the late 21st century, with technology being as futuristic as you would expect; Space ships, planetary colonisation, and, of course, bounty-hunters. The main character Spike Spiegel is one of those bounty-hunters with an unknown past (which becomes more clear in later episodes). He is joined by his friend Jet, an ex-cop who lost his arm in an accident, years ago. They both go hunt bounties each episode, which usually ends up in them receiving no money at all.\
The episodes are set up in a 'monster-of-the-week' style chronology, with overarching plot-lines occasionally bopping their head in to make the viewer remember they were there in the first place. This type of storytelling really has a lot of downsides, and is mainly the reason why I didn't give the story a 9/10. If you don't know what 'monster-of-the-week' means, it means that every episode is basically its own arc of the story, with new characters (aside from the main cast) coming in every episode. The big downside is that any buildup made in the previous arc is usually mostly forgotten by the time the next arc starts (this happens a few times later in). However, I'm not saying it is all bad. Because Cowboy Bebop has literally a bazillion different genres and themes, it's easier for the storywriters to address one or more themes per episode, instead of making it a huge clusterfuck of themes and ideas in one giant 24-episode plot. All-in-all, I think it could have been done better, but it would be really difficult.\
ART - 9/10\
I can't say much about the art except that it was pretty good. The fights are well-choreographed, the animation is smooth, however, it being such an old anime kind of has its downsides which may be hard to get used to. For example, the CG in some episodes are really outdated and practically destroy the immersion, but thankfully the CG is used extremely rarely. Most scenes are very well-made and even ahead of its time at some points. It really holds up well (aside from the CG).\
SOUND - 10/10\
Oh lawd, the music.\
I can safely say that Cowboy Bebop (especially the movie) has the best anime soundtrack ever made. Like the series itself, it really is a mix of all kinds of genres. One episode you may be listening to a wonderfully composed vocal track, and the next episode you might be listening to a piece of hard rock. It not only enhances the thrill, or the enjoyment of certain scenes, it enhances any kind of scene. Dramatic, comedic, action-packed, silly, happy, sad, you name it. Yoko Kanno is by all means an amazing composer, and she even outdid herself. I can't even describe the feelings I felt when I first heard some of these amazingly well-done tracks, and it really is an experience I probably have only felt with maybe a handful of other anime. To round this segment up, Cowboy Bebop's soundtrack is amazing, and you should NOT listen to any tracks before watching the series, as it's kind of spoiler-y.\
As an extra, I can't really say much about the original Japanese dubs, as I'm not Japanese, but I can certainly say that the English dub is incredibly well done, and if you aren't Japanese, I advise you to watch the dub instead of the sub.\
CHARACTER - 9/10\
Ah, the 90s. Character archetypes were still in their infancy, new archetypes were made up everywhere. It was all pioneering. This series might not have the most original characters ever made, but they certainly have amazing backstories. In a way, the character-building might have both gained and lost some of its values because of the 'monster-of-the-week' format. It gained some since every single backstory is bloody beautiful, and the format condenses much more character backstories into a shorter timeframe. On the downside, this makes it so the character buildup feels slightly rushed sometimes, and, like I said in the STORY segment, sometimes these buildups are just completely forgotten by the next episode. For example, there's one episode late in the anime where one of the main cast's characters who has amnesia basically finds out their past, with a terribly sad/dramatic ending to the episode. What, do you expect the drama to go on the next episode? Nope, just back to bounty-hunting with a new bounty to hunt. I might be spoiling things a bit here, but it's just a heads-up.\
ENJOYMENT - 10/10\
Personal enjoyment is probably the biggest factor in the end-score, which is a good thing for Cowboy Bebop because I enjoyed every last second of it. I can't really explain why. The anime is extremely enjoyable, there.\
OVERALL - 9/10\
Does Cowboy Bebop deserve to be engraved in culture forever? Yes. Yes it does. You honestly do yourself a disservice if you don't watch this before your 10th anime. Cowboy Bebop is a classic of anime, and visual media as a whole. The story is amazing and original, the art is good, and still holds up now, the sound is fucking amazing, the characters are interesting, and the series is enjoyable. What more do you want? A hyper-intelligent space-corgi? Oh, wait...\

The anime raises two main discussions that i would like to mention in this review: \
- That it's overrated\
- That it's \"style over substance\"\
To the first statement, i partially disagree. To the second one, i am utterly against. Just let me explain. \
I can understand why a person would harbour the opinion that Cowboy Bebop is so popular that people tend to automatically rate it a ten even before starting the series, saying that it has absolutely no flaws\
          \
        whatsoever. No piece of work is free of having flaws, not even this masterpiece of an anime, and that is a fact that we all must face. I can mention a couple if you want me to, like the episodic way in which the series was arranged bringing too many convenient coincidences and abrupt conclusions to some conflicts. But when those flaws acquire little relevance compared to the positive aspects and do not tamper with the overall quality of the show, that's when we find a good series worth watching. \
The enjoyment a person experiences while watching it is completely personal depending on his or her own preferences and that is why i can totally understand the different ratings this series gets. But something i consider extremely important when reviewing any piece of work is separating our own subjective opinion from the objective view. Subjectively, you may enjoy the episodic arrangement of the anime and its theme or not, but objectively it is almost impossible to state that this series does not have lots of magnificent effort put to good use wether its in the audiovisuals or the character development or any other technical aspect. The combination of those two is what makes a propper review. \
That is why it really bugs me when i find people saying cowboy bebop is overrated and then continue justifying it with facts that revolve more around personal tastes than anything else. \
I, for example, don't tend to enjoy nor episodical nor space anime and that is why it took me so long to pick this up. And yes, it  was a little slow to me because of that, but the fact that i enjoyed it anyways and even finished it actually amazed is a proof of good quality. I could have rated it a 9, but i realised it wasn't fair for the series itself when comparing it to the other animes in my list and the ratings i gave them, because Cowboy Bebop seriously seems like it's made of something else. \
Moving on to the \"style over substance\" matter, i do think that's truly a complete nonsense.  Yes, the style is magnificent and we all can agree to that. The art is good though not a wonder to me, but the animation is flawless, especially in the facial expresions and in the space related movements (meaning laws of physics are not broken and it actually seems realistic and coherent). The music is something from another dimension really. Someone could think that it would be a total mess considering all the different genres of music being played that can either match or not the theme of the anime, but in the end that does not even matter because it mixes so well the scene that it's overwhelming. It's like some words are cut because they are not need, it's the music that speaks to you about the atmosphere and how characters feel. \
But style is not merely enough to make an anime good, and here comes the substance of it which i think is fantastic. This is the first anime i have seen so far that made me really think of the characters as real people. They are so well done and their background is for each one of them so very well developed i was really amazed. The action scenes provide their moments of badassery for the characters but are not overly pretentious and do not cross the line of coherence and possibility. The plot could have it's occasional flaws here or there, but it is obvious that it was carefully sewed into place, so as to establish a sequencial plot involved with the past of the characters even in an episodical series. \
Conclusion: please watch it. It really stands out how this anime is different from the rest and a unique piece of work. \

    \"I’m not going there to die; I’m going to find out if I’m really alive.\" -Spike Spiegel\
Cowboy Bebop is a philosophical journey exploring the identity of human soul and the meaning of life through three main characters with haunting pasts (plus Ed and Ein). The crew journeys throughout the universe as bounty hunters, learning on the way the sense of camaraderie and sense of self-identity. And through thrilling Western fighting scenes and episodic stories of various individuals, Cowboy Bebop extends to the idea of death and existentialism.\
So is Cowboy Bebop a Classic? Definitely.\
Story: 8/10\
The concept the Cowboy Bebop explores is, as I explained earlier, beyond\
          \
        the surface. As one learn more about the characters' past, the more one delves into their shoes. And with an episodic format, Cowboy Bebop is a perfect anime in which you can drop and pick up late without losing important elements of the story. And any western movie fans would just love the action inside this series\
But why isn't this a masterpiece in this department? The concept of reality and fiction is, I'd say, way to much mingled.\
It just feels awkward that in the age of space travels, all the protagonists use pistols rather than futuristic weapons or just even any other assault weapons. What's even more absurd is the fact that the main characters leave without much injury even against hundreds of machine guns without any protective gear. The villains are always a terrible shot for some reason, and the protagonists are way to good of a shot. And some action inside space just breaks the laws of physics alongside casual logic. I know that Cowboy Bebop is more symbolical of a story than a realistic one, but the boundary of fantasy and reality needs to be clear.\
TL DR; Nice symbolical concepts. But blurred line of reality and fantasy.\
\
Art: 8/10\
This was made before 2000. Amazing art for the time.\
Sound: 9.5/10\
Nice jazzy soundtracks that fit with the melancholy mood of the series. It even has an iconic opening theme that will almost never be forgotten by those who watch this series. Background music and sound effects are placed on right times. \
Character: 9/10\
The characters seem simple yet complicated. The interactions between the pure (Ed and Ein) and the impure (Spike, Jet, Faye) is just perfect for the exploration of the human soul. The characters are one-dimensional and complex at the same time, making them feel just so human. \
They feel like people we can relate to rather than a character trapped in a different dimension.\
Enjoyment:9/10\
The action packed western style action anime was a good refreshment for me. But this show may not be the best for binge-watching as these are episodic. But the story adds up, so don't skip episodes. Just slowly watch this anime from time to time.\
Overall: 9/10\
Just an anime series any devoted anime fan should watch. The word \"classic\" perfectly fits this anime. \

    Well, Cowboy Bebop is almost twenty years old and still as a masterpiece, with one of the most memorables soundtracks evermade. It's not a mistake saying that the ost is, somehow, a character, an intermitent part of the story, the conductor of the orchestra that this anime is.\
The episodes are well-done designed for the developing of the main characters, creating with the spectator a short-medium relationship of affection with each one of them. Look: there are only 4 main characters (5, if you count that fabulous dog), and you will be sure, until the end, that each one matter so much and has a great\
          \
        background behind them. Seems something that sould be obviously in any entertainment work? Well, it's not, and here we can see it done in an amazing and unique way.\
Cowboy Bebop is, in a general way, an episodical anime, and it's normal that some episodes will give you more pleasure than others, but it doesn't become a defect exactly. There are so many vritues about the anime that any possible defect seems very small and maybe you don't even notice.\
See you, space cowboy!\

    Cowboy Bebop is one of the anime that can be regarded as the best science fiction anime in the 90s era. I’ve also been watching this anime for a long time and this anime is very different from many aspects when compared to anime nowadays. We know that nowadays, fans are more interesting in an idol, moe, waifu, harem, and so on that, the story in the anime is forgotten. I also really like the things like that but this is one that causes why the anime is best compared to the anime of the 90s. If watching at the present time, Cowboy Bebop loses\
          \
        the sensation of the terms I mentioned earlier but if glanced from various aspects ranging from artwork to storyline, Cowboy Bebop is said to be the best sci-fi anime of 1998.\
Cowboy Bebop is a masterpiece of Sunrise Studio that tries to produce something different from others series. It might be rather difficult to explain why this anime is so great for reviewers and critics. In fact, even in the international world is always glorified by this masterpiece. First of all, let’s try to think that this is not an anime. Cowboy Bebop is like a series made by a successful American from its novel adaptation. This series is made as if it were watched by adults only, who love the action movie and science fiction. Cowboy Bebop like a Trigun or Black Lagoon that can only be watched by adults only, although for the present is also very difficult to find anime of this kind. If it’s made, it may fail greatly because of the market demand that is off the mark.\
Cowboy Bebop is an image that successfully raised the anime to the international world. That is why outsider more prefer this anime over other anime. As Orson Scott Card says, an American novelist, critic, and public speaker: Cowboy Bebop has turned a perception of what people always say badly about anime. Cowboy Bebop managed to make the anime better than its stereotype as a story that made it a big achievement in the sci-fi genre. Cowboy Bebop is more aimed at the episodic system and focuses more on becoming itself like an American Serial TV that always has a continuous plot from time to time like one of the anime that I have reviewed also titled Monster. Both series have a continuous plot so that many people who are very interested to watch both the series even those who don’t like anime will also like it.\
For the size of the Cowboy Bebop series, it can be said to be like the Samurai Champloo series which I have also reviewed. Both series are more focused on a genre of action even though the author seems not to focus on that genre. Both series also sometimes have an unpredictable story ranging from characters to existing stories. Each episode feels random because sometimes we will be made laughing, sometimes we will be made touched, and sometimes we will be amazed of his action. In essence, both series are very difficult to guess. Just like the Monster series, sometimes we are always surprised to be plot-twisty in every episode. Cowboy Bebop has an impressing story that neatly and sensibly enough to be surprised because of this series.\
One more thing about this series is that although this series is titled “Cowboy” in its title, this series doesn’t focus on the theme of the cowboy. We will be amazed by a very cool space-shaped cowboy. Sounds weird, right? For some people, it may sound strange. Why you have to create a nonsense story like this? Hold on, dude. Cowboy Bebop takes on the feel of exoticism and the culture of outsiders like the Indians living in a desert on Mars, a Red Dragon syndicate who always believes in mystical things, Vicious who relies more on katana in some of his battles, and Spike Siegel who owns Jeet Kune Do. Of course, the sci-fi elements aren’t lost out like a western movie with sophisticated technologies.\
Cowboy Bebop is a masterpiece that everyone should be obliged to watch it. Although this series has been long enough, this series still remains to watch but for you who like it. I was also a bit lazy to watch it when the beginning of the first episode started, but I forced myself to watch it to the end and managed to understand what this series is trying to explain us.\

    Okay so I feel obliged to write up a review on my favorite animated space western of all time, Cowboy Bebop. I am not alone in that this show is widely acclaimed by many others as well. The moment I watched Bebop, I expected so much from anything I've watched since and not a lot can live up to Bebop, if any.\
Story: 10\
So basically you have your main character Spike and his bounty hunting partner Jet Black patrolling the galaxy on their ship, the Cowboy Bebop. Along the way they pick up Faye, a woman with hardly any recollection of her past, Ein the smart\
          \
        Welsh Corgi, and Ed, computer whiz. The plot of the story is different from many other fictional works; Bebop's plot isn't a core component of the show. It's all about how all of the characters develop over time. I'll talk about the characters in a little bit.\
Art: 9\
Still a somewhat older anime (19 years old sheesh!) but the art holds up from its debut. Still feels lively and more aesthetically pleasing than its counterparts over those couple of years but would be criticized if it were created today.\
Sound: 10\
I would rate it a 20 if I could. One of the best dubs ever? Check. A fucking amazing OST? Check. All time classing opening? You can honestly just label this as one of the best musically crafted shows not only in anime but in movies and TV as a whole. Any music fan questioning whether they want to watch anime for the first time must start with this show.\
Characters: 10\
The main characters are all different and each have an in depth backstory carefully woven into the series. The main villain, Vicious is only in there for like 3 episodes and he still feels like a really important character in the series. If you believe in a silhouette test, this show literally has it in the opening and it definitely passes with flying colors.\
Enjoyment: 10\
If I weren't pressed for time when I started watching it, I would have watched it in one go. 8-9 hours straight of Bebop is just amazing in my head.\
Recommendation: \
Watch the show. If you're a hater wanting to find a bad review, watch the show. New to anime? Watch this. You've already watched Bebop and want to find other like-minded individuals? Watch it again. Also, listen to the whole OST on YouTube, shit is amazing to listen to during any circumstance.\

    \"And the work which fall unto a new genre Itself shall be called-Cowboy Bebop.\"👌❤\
So,finished Cowboy Bebop for the 2nd time now after many years.😁\
Cowboy Bebop is undoubtedly a Classic masterpiece that is impossible to criticize.\
A truly unique,strong & very mature storyline based on a distant future,revolving around some very sophisticated & well written characters,very cool & realistic action/fight scenes that will keep you entertained thorughout the whole series,amazingly detailed & soothing Artwork & Animations that is rarely seen in animes these days  & Of course there's those classy kickass soundtracks impossible to ignore.\
All in all,this is one of those classy animes that has no\

        equal & there never will be. \
P.S-I really miss sexy & mature woman like Faye Valentine 😍❤...This kind of beautifull,hot bad ass female characters are now extinct from animes these days...most of the lead female characters now are mostly lolies or moe moe shits.😑😑\
As they say,Old is gold..Most of the 90's famous animes I've seen yet are really amazing.\

    Please take my review with a grain of salt as it took me about a month to watch the whole thing.\
~\
Yet another show to cross off my list of \"cult classic\" animes. As expected of a show that shares the same director as Samurai Champloo, the pace and flow of the anime was fluid in its nonchalant transition between each episode and distinguished during. The overall story didn't matter as much as each individual event and this is where some of the artistry lies in this type of storytelling. It allows the viewer to be active in the moment and not anticipating the future or\
          \
        dwelling on what happened in the past. In fact, every event seemed very real in its impromptu and freestyle...style (of course, just like jazz..). Nothing goes according to plan. Nothing happens to develop the story further on. Nothing is orchestrated for this ultimate grand scheme. Everything just happens.\
--THIS SECTION ON CHARACTERS BECAME WAY LONGER THAN EXPECTED, SKIP IF YOU ALREADY DECIDED TO COMMIT THE TIME TO READING THIS--\
The characters were all exciting. Relatable by their individual sins and mannerisms. Jet who reluctantly (yet willingly) supports his partners when he could be saved the headache by ditching them. Spike who personifies the Bruce Lee mantra of \"Be like water\". Faye who similarly throws caution to the wind and loses it all in gambling. And Ed who, after acknowledging her technological gift, could not be described more accurately than as the epitome of any lackadaisical child ever born. \
It begs the question of why a character should be stagnant on the spectrum they reside in. Should protagonists always be likable? Should antagonists always be detested? It is not easy to make a character who fluctuates in personality in a way that doesn't seem targeted or intentional. So we commonly see in a lot of modern day writing (not necessarily a majority, mind you) that good guys are good and bad guys are bad. \
I constantly became frustrated with each characters despite my previous acceptance of their flaws. But I could say the same of my closest friends and I'm sure they could say worse of me. At the end of the day, no matter their mistakes, mischief, or misconduct, characters should be as complex as the people we love and hate.\
--END UNINTENTIONAL LECTURE--\
The music was very good. I, for one, have a hard time sustaining a long term imprint from musical scores so forgive me if I can't provide a more structured opinion on it. I can at least tell you that I enjoyed it very well and all of it, of course, was in good taste.\
The art and animation were incredible. Specific background arrangements and positioning were important. Beautiful landscape shots. Dynamic choreography and animation from hand to hand and gun fights. (Sounds pretty copypasta from my Champloo review?) Everything seemed painstakingly thoughtout and not for a moment did they consider half assing a single frame. Well.. except for the time they used a 3D model, but hey, maybe it seemed really damn cool in 1998.\
All in all, I am simply another brick in the wall supporting this house of Bebop. \

    Oh Cowboy Bebop, how I adore you! If you have watched anime for any period of time you have at least heard about this series. It is an anime famous for its amazing and relaxed soundtrack, lovable characters and mature but fun story. Let us get started reviewing this work of art!\
Story - 7/10\
Wait a minute, haven't I just been praising the series for being a work of art? How dare I give the story a 7/10. The thing about Cowboy Bebop story is that is extremely simplistic. Now is this necessarily a bad thing? Hell no! The relaxed story blends in perfectly with the\
          \
        setting of Cowboy Bebop. It doesn't attempt to tell a story which explores some deeper meaning, because that isn't the goal of the series. The story helps you to learn to love the characters and the world in which they live. \
Art - 9/10\
For the time in which this series was created, it packs some glorious animation. I love how much western influence is put into the world of Cowboy Bebop. Vivid, earthly, colors fit the western theme of the series, to mind-blowing planets, infrastructure and science fiction which is done on a realistic scale. The character design is nothing to be ashamed of either, sporting some of the literally coolest looking characters ever created.\
Sound - 10/10\
Once again here comes the western influence of the anime. Great choice in music at the correct timing makes this series even more pleasant of a watch. The OP of the series fits perfectly with the relaxed and smooth tone of the series, while the ED ties in with the more serious moments within the anime. Whether you are a fan of more dated genres of music, like Jazz, Blues and Classical or not, this musical score will most definitely leave some sort of an impression on you. The voice acting is especially great in the Dub version of the series, with Steven Blum's portrayal of Spike Spiegel being one of the best examples of English dubbing within an anime.\
Character - 10/10\
One of the defining principals of any great entertainment medium is without a doubt the characters within the series/movie/anime/novel ect. This is yet another thing the anime does perfectly. Featuring some of the coolest characters to date as well as some of the quirkiest characters ever. From the cool and suave Spike, the reserved and wise Jet, the sexy and brilliant Faye or the adorable and innocent Ed, Cowboy Bebop is bound to have you hooked on one of the fantastic main characters. What Cowboy Bebop does better than almost most anime ever, is the way they portray their characters as human beings. They aren't some fictional characters which children aspire to be but someone you can relate towards.\
Enjoyment - 10/10\
Being a cynical piece of shit like myself, I really couldn't believe how much I enjoyed Cowboy Bebop and I ended up enjoying it  more than any other anime I have ever seen. The reason being is that the show takes all the elements I love from anime, sprinkle some heavy western influence on top, to create one of the best recipes for anime out there.\
Overall - 10/10\
If there ever was an anime out there to be dubbed as a Masterpiece, Cowboy Bebop would be my first candidate. Sporting incredible visuals, a soothing soundtrack and one of the best casts within an anime, Cowboy Bebop is an anime deserving of a 10/10 rating and I would recommend the series to anyone, because it has something to appease everyone.\

    This is one of the few anime series that I give a 10 across the board to. Every episode is unique and mesmerizing. Every character has a purpose. Every fight scene is artistically done. Most of all it has one of the most interesting concepts of any anime I have ever scene. Anime aside, it's one of the best sci-fi series of all time.\

    Spike and Jet are just a couple of guys cruising around in a spaceship, the Bebop, hunting for bounties in the 21st century. Though life isn't bad, it wouldn't hurt to have some beef with their beef and bell peppers. Things change though as new characters join the crew and we catch glimpses into their pasts. With the introduction of Ein, a very special dog, Faye, a gambler without a memory, and Edward, an eccentric, computer-hacking girl, bounties become only part of the story. Crime mobs, old loves, and the search for family guide the show to a dramatic conclusion.\
Cowboy Bebop is often hailed as\
          \
        one of the greatest series of our time and one which transformed the way anime was done. To an extent, the consensus is right. Bebop went to a new level of dedication and detail, possessing animation and a soundtrack which rivaled those of full-fledged animation films.\
Characters and settings are lifelike, beautiful, and hold up against the newest animation being done today. Yoko Kanno presents what is easily one of the greatest original soundtracks to an anime of all time: that a band, the Seatbelts, was brought together specifically for the show and that they successfully captured the spirit of the beat and jazz movements only goes to illustrate the amount of effort put into the Bebop project (noteworthy tracks include Space Lion, Piano Black, Tank!, and Green Bird). But as much as the animation and audio are spectacular, the storyline is lacking. Bebop has potential, don't get me wrong, and was at times incredibly exciting. The underlying premise is unique and should certainly be enough to catch anyone's attention for a good 4 or 5 episodes. The problem lies in a lack of coherency and plot development. While it isn't unusual for anime to have filler episodes which help develop characters without developing the story in any meaningful way, Bebop makes a habit of it.\
And while even that may not be a huge problem, the story ultimately has to rely on the premise and characters alone. Viewers that continue to watch will do so not for any sort of developing plot, but because they enjoy the characters, the idea of flying around in space hunting bounties, or the incredible soundtrack and impressive animation. This point was driven home for me while viewing the final episodes: seemingly out of the blue, Spike is infiltrating a crime mob, shooting everything in sight while dramatic music blares in the background. All of this is exciting, but it felt contrived; when there is little to no build-up to the finale, it isn't as good as it should have been. Bebop also brags at times about being a show which will define anime (or a new type of anime) with its creation. Like I mentioned, to an extent that's true. Attention to animation and a superb soundtrack make this an excellent show, and the underlying premise and characters are intriguing and enjoyable. But I would be disappointed in the state of anime were this to become the actual benchmark: the storyline and plot development just don't cut it.\

    Cowboy Bebop is simply the best anime series. The show is not only a classic but a masterpiece. The story follows a Spaceship filled with a crew of two men, one woman, one teenage girl, and a Welsh Corgi. The characters are forever lasting on your heart when you know their background story. Even the minor characters and non re occurring ones make a memorable impression. The music is perfect for the show and Yoko Kanno eve created The Seatbelts to perform all the songs. Simply a fantastic anime all around. This is one anime I do not mind watching in either English or Japanese.\

    I'm kind of partisan here. This has been one of my favorites for a very long time. While many of my other favorite series have been replaced over time, this one still easily fits in my top 5.\
Approaching 15 years since first broadcast, Bebop's art still rivals the best of current productions. Fully CG backgrounds, when used, are largely well integrated into the show's artistry. To be fair, of course, there are a few places where you can see the infancy of the medium when comparing it to Shingeki no Kyojin or Psycho Pass, but you have to be looking to find it. The CG\
          \
        never detracts from the story.\
Of course, what truly brings Cowboy Bebop together is its music. Yoko Kanno's instrumentation are superb - and they fit so seamlessly into the story you feel almost as if the scenes were designed for the music rather than the usual music designed for scenes. A Jazz fan myself, I couldn't be happier with the score, though you needn't have studied Jazz to enjoy the music.\
At heart, this is a character driven show, but don't let that fool you into thinking there isn't an overarching story. Some episodes are more obviously connected with the backbone, while others only lightly touch upon it. Yet every episode contributes to a story that truly deserves its place among the masterpieces of anime, and indeed of all cinema.\
Those who haven't seen it yet, or who stopped within a few episodes wondering what the hype is about, I suggest you ride the show out. While I can't say you'll think the same way I do by the end, I'm confident you'll understand how compelling the story is by the time you finish. Some shows don't deserve the hype they get. Cowboy Bebop proves, even at 15 years old, that not all hype is undeserved.\

    the story:\
the plot of this anime doesn't begin to unfold until the very end of the anime. most of the episodes include missions unrelated to the bigger plot, and that is my biggest problem with the anime. \
art:\
the art used in this anime is very intricate, yet familiar for the viewer,  since the story is set in a time period not distant from today, we get a feeling of what the future potentially will look like. \
sound: \
love the sound of exploding gun powder. also, the background soundtrack fits perfectly with the anime. \
characters:\
the character design for this anime is simply genius; each and\
          \
        every character is unique in their own way. i've never seen a character as original as spike spiegel, or edward ( the computer genius; and shes a girl ). it makes the story much more interesting. \
enjoyment: \
this is one of the more meaningful animes that i have seen. it leaves the viewer to not only think about the plot, but just life in general. \
' i felt like i was watching a dream i could never wake up from. before i  knew it, the dream was over.' - spike spiegel\
overall: \
the main reason why i give it a 9 overall is that the episodes involving the unrelated missions don't exactly correspond to the main plot; all those episodes could be taken out and the viewer would still be able to understand what was going on. however, this anime has had a good deal of impact on the way i watch animes. this anime portrays a great deal of symbolism, in which the viewer is also left to ponder and translate the puzzling philosophies of spike spiegel. \

     Do you know that hunger pang when you haven't planned on anything to eat it, and you check what food stuff you have and randomly put things together; and it tastes great ( most likely because u are really hungry). Well that's the kind of feeling I got when I was watching Cowboy Bebop. I mean cowboys or bounty hunters to be exact, syndicates, space gates and a lot of other, um, stuff all in 26 episodes is really peculiar and familiar all at the same time. \
As a person who is accustomed to long running shounen anime, I found Cowboy Bebop quite refreshing.\
          \
        The show comprised series  short, not-so-interconnected  stories. After watching the first episodes, I thought a story line would pick up; I was wrong,however. Nonetheless, the short stories were enjoyable. Each episodes has this strong emotional scenes which a person can really feel exuding from the anime. I am talking about such things as betrayal friendship,love and the like of sort . What I am trying to say is the story does not over-exaggerate events relating to something sentimental compared to anime now. You would understand when you watch it. \
Art\
 I am not really a good judge of art, but the one in this anime is shouting an 18+  rating. \
Characters\
Since this is a short anime. You are not likely to get emotionally  involved with the characters. Spike, the main character doesn't speak much: Jet is always scolding them off: Faye just wants to hug all the bounty to herself: Ed is just eccentric though I will say he - or is it a she- is my favorite character.\
  I started watching these show because it had high ratings, and I read a lot of posts about it saying how classical it was, and how it didn't participate in fan services. Frankly, I don't know the definition of classical anime, but this anime is worth given a shot. Through Cowboy Bebop episodes, my favorite was episode #24 , I really felt something there.",

     I my eyes cowboy bebop is an classic..it can never be replaced by an anime trying to come up with the same concept. it was cool for me because it didn't just try to have one main character (besides you always seeing spike) it had told backgrounds of the whole crew with is good. every episode has some kind of gun acting with was great for kids cause we love violence and i just loved how spike had that laid back character it just hooked me ever since the first episode. and how could you not enjoy tank (the opening song even if it\

Unique show that  features amazing characters amidst a fun episodic style.\
Episodes are either (background) stories of the main characters or episodic stories about new characters.\
Those episodic episodes manage to fully flush out one or more characters in only 20 minutes.\
The story episodes are also amazing , the backstory for the characters is very well made and it makes you better understand their personality and overall character.\
This show simply has everything and commits practically zero flaws along the way.\
The animation still looks good even after all these years and the English voice acting is some of the best around.\
In the end this show delivers\
          \
        an amazing journey with good characters while never feeling tiresome or repetitive.\
The single best thing is still the jazzy style , truly unique and fitting.",

    In order to truly appreciate Bebop, you need to be able to do two things:\
\
Recognize just how absurd it is. It's the story of a kung-fu bounty hunter, his ex-cop friend, a shrewd woman with a hazy past and a crazy little girl who happens to be a hacker. Don't even think it stops there; these guys fly through the galaxy rounding up criminals for a quick buck and smoking cigarettes and complaining while looking cool, all set to an unmistakable and eclectic soundtrack featuring many great American styles of music.\
The second thing you need to do embrace the absurdity, as well as the sheer\
          \
        style and pizzazz it pulls all this off with. Even the wackier moments are just too damned cool. \

    When I read a synopsis for \"Cowboy Bebop\" learning that it was about bounty hunters wandering in space in hunger and desperation, looking for criminals to regain money, I pictured something a little inane.\
Cowboy Bebop is actually a luxurious little comedy-drama masterpiece about the pain of being poor and out-of-luck, especially for an adult who considers his life to be a nightmare or a dream that he can never wake up from. Spike is not only a troublemaker, he's tired, hungry and feeling a bit hopeless for money. An ex-cop (in which he considers his partner) reintroduces him to new characters, a gambler, a hyperactive\
          \
        genius smart aleck and a super-intelligent dog as they attempt to help collect criminals for money to make his life easier. Not to mention, he cares for him and even his new friends a lot.\
Anime featuring characters jumping into the anime every few episodes take a lot of money to produce and usually work if the build-up depending on the synopsis is correct. Anime these days usually introduces us to new characters maybe once in a few episodes but usually around the first episodes. Well, here, it's done tastefully and emotionally. It's really good to see Ein, the dog come first as the new character in the series in which everyone seems to like, Faye, a selfish woman who is sometimes criticized and sometimes praised, for liking the character, Spike Spiegel. And then there's Edward, she comes in a while in which everyone describes as cute and fun or sometimes thinks that she could be annoying sometimes.\
Towards the end of the series, I started bawling my eyes out because some of the characters start having more and more problems depending on their lives and they must face it... it's gone. Anime about the anime are usually a little coy, but \"Cowboy Bebop\" is an exception. With its film-noir characters, it understands the bounty hunting or desperation world and is quite wise about poor or ghetto people live off-screen.\

    Cowboy Bebop is still, by far, my favorite anime. Though it does have a slow pace, the character development is amazing. By the end of the series I was attached to every one of the characters. Speaking of endings, this series builds up to the very end and gives an emotionally wrenching but satisfying ending. The series is so deep that I have seen it at least 5 times and still enjoy watching it. I encourage anyone who enjoys action, character development, and space to watch this series. It may start off slow but once you're hooked, you're hooked.\

    Well, I started watching Cowboy Bebop because it had the same Writer and Director as Samurai Champloo. and since I really enjoyed that one, I decided to try this too.\
Until episode 7-8 I thought Champloo was better and the characters were cooler. but than, I decided to stop comparing the 2 series and watch this one as a total different one. It was around the time that Ed got into the anime. boy, I love that character :D I found the trick quite helpful and I really enjoyed Cowboy Bebop. It had comedy, It had Drama, It had romance, It had mystery,... It was near\

    Finally saw this after pretty much every one of my anime-watching friends recommended it to me, so I had some seriously high expectations of this series when I started.   Thank goodness I wasn't disappointed.\
The story: 10/10\
Bebop is nothing like your average anime, it's run rather like a Saturday morning cartoon.  It features less of a cohesive connective plot and is more like a play by play capture.  The story not cheesy though by any means: each episode usually has the characters in some situation, usually involving a bounty, and will shape up into anything from a goofy but awesome action packed\
          \
        shootout to an emotional look into a character's past.  Overall I felt like they got the pacing really well.  And without spoiling anything I can still say you want to watch until the very end because it's pretty emotionally impacting compared to the rest of the usually lighthearted and carefree tone throughout the story.\
The art: 8/10\
This is the 90s we are talking about, so despite the limitations of 20 year old tech the show still looks pretty good and moves fluidly at most points.  The age does show in some of the detail and the show's take on what is \"advanced\" technology could be better, but the detail and care put into the action scenes was pretty awesome considering there was practically no computer imaging.\
The music: 10/10\
The jazz soundtrack composed by Yoko Kanno and Seatbelts was half of why I loved this series.  A great mix between lively horns and upbeat tempo for the action scenes and slow almost smokey saxophone for the more somber times.  I would definitely listen to this outside of the show.  \
The characters: 9/10\
The cast for Bebop is weird and therefore each is memorable in their own way.  The show took time to make each of them relatable by diving into their back-story at some point, and everyone plays an important part of each episode.  I've  never seen a cast that is so well balanced overall, but I  arrived at the end honestly wishing that I knew more about them than I did.  The series makes you look in like an outsider, but I felt like it intended you to feel that way.\
Overall I loved this show for being so different.  It doesn't fit any anime \"formula\" and it's not perfect (because no anime is really), but it is one of a kind and invokes a kind of nostalgia that I couldn't explain.  If you don't mind branching out and seeing something that dares to be really different you will  likely love this show as much as I did.\

    Finally, I had some time to write my first review this anime sure deserves much more.\
This was really a great ride 26 episodes of enjoyment this series was really outstanding it had a lot of influence on me I really enjoyed it starting by:\
Story: Although it didn't have a major plot it was still enjoyable for an episodic show this was really one hell of a ride 9/10\
Art: The art was really special and unique not like these days anime which one eye is bigger than the other, to be honest, it was 85% like a Ghibli movie really outstanding, and it had a mix\
          \
        of the western cartoon on it I really like that of course in a Japanese anime style. 10/10\
Sound: I really loved the voice actors they were really awesome and I thank them for their great work on this show, the sound effects were great for 1998 anime it was really outstanding. 10/10\
Character: I think this show was mostly successful because of the uniqueness of these four main characters as well as the others, each one had their own attitude and they didn't change it for some any reason except major things 10/10\
Enjoyment: it was really enjoyable, but I would have loved it more if there was more dark and hopeless and despair in it 8/10\
Overall: it was a very Great show that I would definitely watch it again in the future. 9/10\

    So, Cowboy Bebop was one of the many animes, that everyone talks, or talked, or mentions time to time, and I thought, might as well give it a shot. And thanks Dog I didn't miss this title. \
Don't get me wrong, the story isn't any kind of extraordinary, it has quite a few filler episodes, I guess, that's every TV show's curse. But it's not the point. Cowboy Bebop combines together what at first glance looks like incompatable things: wild west thrill, space journey and ganster movies. You have: native americans, jazz and funk, bandits, corrupted society full of punks, countless criminals and headhunters (aka\
          \
        cowboys). And that 20-30's USA aesthethic really blends in well with sci-fi elements. \
But what I think really keeps you watching is character depth. Every single character has a mysterious past, and that makes you want to uncover that and get the big picture. And to answer your question, yes, they do not fail at doing that. \
Overall, this is classic. I've recently started to explore the world of japanese animation, and if you're like me, this is a must-watch. It's really an important part of anime history. \
P.S.: On the side note, I gotta say, Cowboy Bebop looked and felt like Firely to me. If you don't know what this is, this is 2002 TV show (non-anime) broadcasted by FOX. So, if you feel like you want something really similar, check out that as well. \

    !THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!\
Cowboy Bebop is the first anime that I've watched from start to finish that didn't leave me with a, \"OMG THAT WAS SO FCKUING GOOD SFETGSTIOERLF\" feeling. It's not that I didn't like it, I mean obviously since I watched the entire thing, but the story left me a little...unsatisfied tbh. Idk betweenn Faye who was annoying as fuck (except in the last episode) and all this other shit that happened, I expected so much but was left with so little really. I can see why it's managed to stay in the top 30 for so long, but it just wasn't for\
          \
        me. But it was good, but Idk. If the story had managed to end in a slightly positive light whilst at the same time making Faye less annoying over time, I would've liked it more, but it sucked in regards of story and character. The only character who was introduced that didn't annoy me was Ed. I liked her so much I made my first gifset in awhile out of her (if you wanna see then here https://animeesthetic.tumblr.com/post/162791514595)\
As for the music and art, well the art was good. And the music inspired the material for my 4th Nocturne (I' m a composer), which is why I'm giving this anime a 9.While the music was good enough to inspire me, the characters and their development over the course of the show was heavily lacking and the story was a little bit too downtrodden (although tbh I expected Spike to die in the end), but it wasn't enough to kill my overall enjoyment thanks to the music and Ed. So yeah.\

    Nineteen years ago, during the year 1998, a Space Western anime was released by the name of Cowboy Bebop, an anime that would go on to become one of the finest pieces of animation ever made. Adapted and completely redesigned from its manga counterpart, with direction by Shinichirō Watanabe, this 26-episode long, seinen neo-noir anime series would continue to astound fans of the medium for decades to come.\
The episodes for the show tend to be very episodic in nature, usually in two-parts, with stunning fluidity from one space romp to the next. Even though most of the episodes are unrelated, there’s never a disjointed feeling\
          \
        of randomness, or having any kinds of fillers simply to bulk out the serial. It all fits wonderfully. Everything just belongs, nothing more and nothing less. When we do have story-specific arcs, they are laced with emotional intensity and the complexities that go with having a past you’re not so fond of. There’s so much grey in between the black and white that each character is portrayed to be multidimensional and so much more than a pretty face, or an intellectual genius.\
The chemistry between all of the members of Bebop is one of my absolute favourite elements. They are flawed as fuck human beings, with quirks that cause a lot of grating disagreements and vexing (for them, not the audience) interactions. Nonetheless, they all have a key component in common that holds them together like a dysfunctional family. No matter how many times they try to walk away, eventually they find themselves back home. This is realistic. It’s believable. It’s something to connect with. Some will have a much more intimate relation to it than others. It’s comforting.\
As I mentioned earlier, the animation, regardless of being almost 20 years old, still holds up really damn well. The power is in the details, literally. There are so many details that went into establishing the environments within the series that the best way to describe it is breath-taking. Whether the setting is the interior (or even exterior) of a ship, space itself, planets with crumbling or bustling cities, the characters themselves and the expressions that they make—it’s all extremely astounding. These little soft lines and harsh curves with unique shades of red, blue, and orange all create the mood and tone for which makes Bebop a bonafide neo-noir experience.\
Even with all of these awesome traits, none of it really means anything if you can’t look beyond the animation and the cast to see just how far ahead of its time Cowboy Bebop truly was.\
It’s 1998 and gender roles are getting less defined. This show broke gender moulds back then, and it continues to do so in the modern age. You have women, beautiful women and average women and women from all walks of life in regards to race, ethnicity, etc., who are never judged for being just that. They are portrayed as very strong, independent ass-kickers. It didn’t matter if they were criminals, heroes, or in between somewhere. The women in the show are some of the most intelligent people, and it’s never questioned or treated like it’s some kind of phenomenon. Good examples of badass ladies include Faye Valentine, Julia, and a very special bartender who’s a good friend of Spike’s (name’s not given to avoid spoilers).\
One of our main characters, Edward, is a teenage girl, but it’s rarely brought up. Hell, her name is Edward. People don’t really care if she’s a she. Ed is a genius and eccentric as all fuck, and quite androgynous. Her brilliance is what makes her a compelling character. Yes, some people do gander at her gender, but it’s more of a passing curiosity. Her ability to do what she does is never doubted or questioned because of her being a girl. Most of the doubt stems from her sensationally unique persona and young age. We have another character in one of the episodes that’s a hermaphrodite. While it’s a bit uncommon, it never becomes the focal point of who he is or what he does. He’s just another person in the galaxy who’s got his own burden to bear.\
So, yeah, gender roles and our ridiculous pre-conceived notions of what gender means doesn’t mean shit in this anime. I fucking love it.\
A more common motif in the series is the belief that you are always a master of your own choices and leader of your own fate. Life is something to do with what you will, which is clearly exhibited by the decisions taken by our motley crew of criminal hunters, especially as their pasts begin to surface and reveal itself. Allowing yourself to be held back by some predetermined ideals that you may not even believe in isn’t living. The idea of having “obligations” and that there’s always an inherent “right” and “wrong,” is utterly false in the grand scheme of things and don’t account for jack shit if you’re going to be miserable in the end. This motif is beautifully complimented and further ingrained by the music…\
Something else that gives the series loads and loads of depth is… the music. I’m sure that anyone reading this review that’s already had a chance to watch this anime was probably wondering when I’d bring this up. Well, here it comes. Hold on to your butts, my friends.\
Yoko Kanno is quite possibly one of the most brilliant composers of the modern age. Her work has made appearances in many anime serials across the board from Wolf’s Rain to Terror in Resonance and a few others; each one a magnificent and stellar feat of musical capacities. Yet, I don’t think she can ever really top what she’s accomplished with Cowboy Bebop.\
The Seatbelts is the fictitious Japanese space jazz band led by Kanno. The name derives from how the performers wear seatbelts to be safe as they participate in some serious hard-core jam sessions. This band, put together by Kanno, is responsible for all of the music in Cowboy Bebop.\
The styles of music utilised is enthrallingly diverse and ranges from straight big band jazz to blues, acoustic ballads, hard rock, and country to funk and electronic. Hip-hop and experimental compositional elements also make their appearances. Aside from sounding extraordinary, the music in and of itself speaks volumes of what the show is about. If you look at most, if not all, of these genres, they began during periods of history where a voice of rebellion needed to rise. It was a means for people to expel their frustrations at life and all of the bullshit that they had to endure. Blues is a very depressing genre, originally created to voice the hardships that came from slavery and oppression. Jazz became a significant boom during the 1920s when war was looming and young folks were forced to fight or choose a side; when a passionate desire for independence was boiling to its peak. This included the rise of women’s empowerment and freedom of choice.\
Every genre used to create the tunes began as a fight against being oppressed and having severely limited rights, if you had any to begin with. The music was about growing up and facing your fears and your monsters, to make life what you wanted of it. These genres were all born out of necessity to have something powerful and positive to believe in; a way to share the pain so you could stop it from continuing onwards.\
As I mentioned earlier, this theme is apparent in all four members of our cast—Faye Valentine, Jet Black, Spike Spiegel, and even Edward. They all had something they were fighting for and some strong personal beliefs that drove them to become the people that they became; changes that needed to be made so they could be the stronger, better versions of their old selves.\
Cowboy Bebop has so much more to it than the few things I’ve mentioned in this insanely long ass review. To be blunt, I wish I could talk about all of them because that’s how much I loved this series. I’m so passionate about it and what it means and what it stands for. But if I chat about everything, then you guys may not want to pick it up (if you haven’t already). I know that hype can have a negative effect on me; look at how long it took me to pick up the series.\
While I do regret not picking it up sooner, I’m supremely satisfied with the fact that I waited so long. The world is a terribly different place now than it was in 1998. Not only was I just a child, there honestly wasn’t much that I could’ve related to the show back then as there is now, at least for me as an individual watcher. Maturity aside, I feel like the messages that are shared so passionately and so brilliantly in this anime are far more superior and relevant in 2017 than they would’ve been in 1998. But the fact that is was made 20 years ago, just goes to show you how far ahead of its time it truly was, which further intensifies my love for the science-fiction genre, no matter the medium.\
In conclusion, I want to make one thing very clear: Cowboy Bebop is what it is, is as powerful and as remarkable as it is, because everything fits together so nicely. If you remove even one small facet of the show, it would’ve fallen completely apart. The music, any one of the characters (including minor ones), the animation, the motifs—anything at all and it wouldn’t be a work of art. It’s complex and intricate because every single piece makes it so; they’ve all got their place. Lose a single one and you’ve got nothing but a mediocre space western. Details are what create a masterpiece, especially when they’re subtle and natural.\

    (I try to keep my reviews short and sweet and straight to the point without giving away spoilers with that said lets get this show on the road)\
Cowboy Bebop , is an old school, well thought out /planned anime. Anime's like these are so hard to fine. Something that is easy to follow and understandable. Most anime's nowadays are so colorful, with great animation but the story line and characters are completely shot. \
Story- The story gives off an original feel. Every episode left be wanting more and it was so easy to follow. However, there were too many plots they tried to squeeze into\
          \
        a 26 episode series. Some questions were never answered. I believed that they tried to cover up these lapses with one big plot overall.\
Art- The art was so retro. I loved it!! It totally took you back to a time were details to each character (no matter the importance or stance) was important. \
Sound- The voice actors did a great job with bringing these character to life.\
Character- Some characters were develop more than others, which was a complete let down. They opened the flood gates but never closed it. Nonetheless, no character was completely left alone as a filler. Some episodes were completely dedicated to one character. Thus, it gave the reviewer a deeper sense of each main character.\
Overall- I enjoyed this anime. I loved the style and how the creators used there own creative spirits to make this anime come to life. Overall it's a wonderful anime and I would recommend it to anyone. \

    To begin, I will say that I rarely watch anime anymore, and when I do nowadays it's usually older ones that weren't/aren't mainstream. I left all of that shonen stuff back in middle-early high school where it belongs (I'm already nearing 30). I try to watch more nowadays, it's just there is rarely any anime that pulls me in, but I digress.\
Review: \
Great music, great setting, great art, great characters, meh overarching plot. In the end it was little above average. When it was good it was REALLY good. When it wasn't it dragged on forever and I couldn't wait to get to the next\
          \
        episode already. \
I didn't really have any expectations going in other than forums recommending it. But it started to wane around halfway through the series. I understand that the anime is episodic (I've greatly enjoyed other episodic animes like Baccano! and Samurai Champloo), but a number of episodes around the middle of the series clearly stood out to me as not as enjoyable to watch. \
Story-wise, what CB ends up being for me is simply a story of existing. \"Simply\" being the keyword here because I feel like that is the reason why the show didn't wow me, yet however, it was uniquely bland. Everything simply existed; happened. I think that's part of the beauty of it; it wasn't anything special. No mind-blowing philosophical themes are shoved in your face a la Psycho Pass. No big revelations or thrills. Life in the universe of CB simply is what it is, and like the ending, it just goes on. Implicitly, there is a lot to say there that takes a little finesse to figure out.\
I will say that CB is a damn good gem. I haven't seen anything like it. But it didn't blow me away. It was subtle. I don't think I would want to rewatch it anytime soon. Maybe when I'm a lot older again and life has taken its course. \

                          \
    I can understand those who say all the praise CB gets is undeserved and that the anime is overrated. For the first six or ten episodes, I had  this feeling that people nowadays just uncritically praise what has established itself in the mainstream for decades, Cowboy Bebop being one those cases. The only thing that kept me watching the show for these first impressions was the Opening Theme, by far the best I've ever heard and probably the best there is out there. It feels timeless, special and different, easily standing out from all the pop punk screamo bands that feature in these day's\
          \
        animes and are just downright annoying and generic.\
But a instrumental jazzy song can't carry a whole anime on its amazing harmonic shoulders, of course. \
What made Cowboy Bebop special to me, first of all, is exactly what I least enjoy in other animes: episodic narratives. The repetitiveness of a formula that is abused in each episode - (slight) variation of a same theme -  is extremely boring to me. Gladly, that's not the case for CB. \
Seemingly apathetic bounty-hunters in space can sound uninteresting for those who dislikes westerns like me, but when it comes to Cowboy Bebop, it is not the same trope, it is not the same formula.\
Spike, Jet and their crew face uniquely special adventures each episode, which perfectly incorporates and embraces the sci-fi theme into the narrative. The episodes themselves had this sort of short-movie like quality that wasn’t uncreative in the least. Some were pretty simple, like the ones portraying the life of the crew inside Bebop, but still, it added dynamic to a trope that seemed to be constrained by the dystopian side of sci-fi (not really in the context of the 90’s, I guess). \
The gist of the show, or should I say, the closing of Spike’s arc is only disclosed in the end of the show. It wasn’t anything mind-blowing or  beautifully crafted like a ancient greek tragedy, it felt just like The End. Some might say it was just irresponsible, but the magic of the entire anime didn’t fade in my eyes.\
The art is just out-of-this-world beautiful. For me that means that I can see things as they are: no flare, no sparks, no needless reflective objects, just plain urban-like scenario and the flick of a cigarette, my favorite aesthetic. The characters sometimes look taller than usual, or just pretty asymmetrical sometimes, but, well, that doesn’t bother me at all.\
Except for the delay in disclosing each character’s background, and sometimes doing a poor job at that, the overall work feels like a 10 for me. I’ve never experienced watching something like that, and I feel grateful.\

    Cowboy Bebop: highly rated in the anime community, abnormally well received outside of the anime community, accompanied by a cult fan-base... sounds too good to be true...\
But I must say, that I don't believe the show has helped with any cures to diseases, scientific achievements, breakthroughs in technology, or advances in diplomatic relationships.\
So I guess it does have flaws.\
But if you haven't watched this show and are an anime fan, or even if you are just browsing this website, then you have spent some time devoted to anime that could've been better spent watching this show.\
I find it a shame that anime is clouded by\
          \
        people who complain about the episodic nature of the show. Compared to Bebop, a series that relies on overly-dramatic cliff-hangers is shallow. Bebop is developed: from the complexity of the characters (if you only see the main cast as their surface presents, I suggest to rewatch and pay more attention to the details of the characters pasts, as well as their present) to the vivid animation (and I don't mean flashy colors, I mean how the pieces move, their shape, design, etc...)\
Lastly, the quality of the music can not be understated. Almost every single anime on the earth suffers from its cliched garbage music. Thank you Bebop, for bringing us a soundtrack that I don't want to skip over, but I can even call a masterpiece.\

    I really enjoyed the hell out of this anime to be honest. It's nice to watch an anime that is full of sci-fi, action and comedy. Bounty Hunters from space, eh? Hehehe.\
The music in every episode fits perfectly well with the anime which gives out that Western style. Yee haw! Especially the fact that the anime is full of badassery and action. \
I was pretty much confused with one of the characters, Edward. Yeah, I thought the kid was a boy but she's actually a girl. But anyway, the final ending was so intense....HOLY SHIT! But I will not spoil it for anyone.\

    The Positive Side:  Cowboy Bebop was the first anime I could really get into as an adult, and its maturity remains one of the things that sets it apart from most popular anime of its time.  After watching hokey kids’ stuff like Pokémon and the cheesy, attack-name-screaming, adolescent violence of Dragon Ball Z, I was a little surprised to find an anime I could actually take seriously.  Despite it being science fiction, Cowboy Bebop’s setting feels both believable and extremely original.  The smokey, ill-lit bars and gray, rain-washed city-streets could have been pulled straight out of a crime noir film, and\
          \
        there’s a joy in watching hi-tech innovations like space-ships and computer hackers interact with mafia hierarchies and drug deal plots.\
Despite hailing from the era of pre-digital animation, Cowboy Bebop’s art is superb.  The character designs are striking and memorable, and there’s just enough color to offset the generally somber backgrounds.  The fight scenes are particularly wonderful, and Spike’s martial arts motto, “Be like water,” translates into action that is both fluid and visceral.\
As for the music… well, just about the entire soundtrack is composed by Yoko freakin’ Kanno, perhaps the greatest musical talent in the anime industry.  The Seatbelts deliver a blend of jazz, blues and rock that moves from melancholy to energetic and back in perfect sync with the story.  The lyrics are pretty terrific on tracks that have them, so it’s worth putting an ear to the OST.\
The character development is all-around great.  Our protagonist, Spike Spiegel, has more than enough casually badass attitude and ass-whupping ability to serve as an escapist character, but also has just enough brooding moments that you can feel how his past has scarred him.  Jet is an ideal foil, constantly fretting and worrying over Spike’s well-being like a surrogate father while insisting that he doesn’t care what happens to Spike if he leaves.  Faye serves as wild-card, shifting femme fatale to ally at the drop of a hat, constantly keeping the audience guessing as to where her loyalties lie, or if they even exist.  Ed is a consistently bubbly comic relief, but also contributes to the team through her incredible hacking abilities.  Even minor characters who are only present for an episode or two gleam with life and intrigue.\
The show gives us a good look at how people struggle against their own pasts.  There are plenty of other themes—vengeance, war, and ambition—but at its heart, this is a story about the struggles between past and future, a theme captured by the anachronistic setting as well as by the struggles of our intrepid bounty hunters.\
The Negative Side: Where does Cowboy Bebop come up short?  Well… uh… it isn’t the cure for cancer, nor will it help you lose 20 pounds in 30 days.\
Joking aside, this anime is about as close to perfect as they come.  Some fans are put off by the plot structure, which is far more episodic than most anime, but every episode is capable of standing on its own, so it really doesn’t suffer from a lack of over-arching plot.  Criticizing Cowboy Bebop simply because its structure is different is more a failure on the part of the critic than it is a failure on the part of the work.  Take the show for what it is, and you won’t be disappointed.",

    I apoligize for writing another review for this show on a different account, but I love writing reviews for this show and decided to write a more detailed one. Well, here we go.\
Cowboy Bebop is probabaly one of the best anime shows on Earth and I'll tell you why. The artwork is amazing and so is the animation and is good for old-schoolers to enjoy. The animation makes you feel like you're back in the 70s along with the music. It's jazzy and has its blues from the 50s-60s I think.\
Story:\
The story focuses on a duo of bossy bounty hunters who happen to be poor\
          \
        dogs. They need money so this guy named Jet (who's the owner of the ship) leads a man named Spike to help out to get some cash. They soon come across three other bounties and their names are Faye Valentine, the bossy gambler, Radical Edward, the playful but mischevious teen, and Ein, the smart and intelligent dog. Soon, their adventures begin... into an amazing one. I can't spoil the ending, but it does get funny every once in a while... it has its drama, comedy, romance, action and thriller, but is also very painful at the end... which most crybabies can't handle.\
Sound:\
I loved the jazzy music and blues in this. Especially with the Tank! opening or the Space Lion songs... both of these songs rocked and are one of my favorites in Cowboy Bebop. I also liked \"Blues\" too. And let me introduce the amazing voice actors they picked... Steven Jay Blum and Wendee Lee both did a great job with their characters and I thought that they had the best voices to ever exist in dubbed anime. At first, I never liked to watch anime dubbed, but now I'd want to watch it in subtitles except for Cowboy bebop, the voices really fit the characters' moods and attitudes and I'm very happy for the creator who did it. It was better than the Japanese subtitles... which were a lot better in dialouge because you could understand that some of the characters are moody every once in a while.\
Characters:\
Oh my gosh! My favorite is definietely Spike... he's my all-time favorite. And I loved Faye too... of course I didn't really care for her in the beginning, but now she seems like the funniest anime character ever behind Spike Spiegel. I also loved Ed too, who I'd say was pretty annoying at times, but I still loved her. Spike had his passion... he's quite mischevious and so is Faye who was pretty naughty, bossy and tomboyish while Ed is simply just onrery. Nothing to say about Jet but he was cool I guess. Ein was adorable!\
Animation:\
The animation seemd to match what the future may be like including the artwork. Yeah, I know it may be a little jumpier than most anime are, but it is pretty cool and I loved how they drew in the artwork for what how Mars, Jupiter or Asteriod would look like.\
Enjoyment:\
I guess I wasn't really enthused with the anime the first few episodes, but on Honky Tonk Woman, it got interesting... I didn't really like Gateway Shuffle very much, but Ballad of Fallen Angels made me want to watch the whole thing. There are very unique episodes such as Stray Dog Strut where Ein comes in and they have to track down a puppy, Honky Tonk Woman where they go to try to get money on gambling but coincendentally permitted a woman to join the team who is actually a bounty, Gateway Shuffle where they capture a bounty who is fond of her son, Sympathy for the Devil where Spike has to help this senior kid-looking guy turn into a senior so that he could die and many more. My favorite episode would have to be Brain Scratch, but Toys in the Attic where the Bebop was filled with plutonium was interesting too and then I enjoyed the series mainly the whole way through even though there were some episodes that weren't my cup of tea or were just nothing special.\
Overall: A Great series to watch for the old-schoolers and definetely for anybody who doesn't watch anime... they could warm-up with a very good start on Cowboy Bebop unless they've seen a couple.\

                          \
    Anyway, starting off with the usual: the visuals. The art style is somewhat gritty and dark, very similar to Western animation, and misses some of the usual tropes we’ve come to expect from anime – huge eyes, crazy spiky hair, et cetera. The only character who looks particularly anime-like is Faye, but she’s a visual anomaly all to herself. Seriously, what in the world was up with her clothes? I could overlook that in a less serious anime than this but it’s so freaking hard to take the show seriously when this woman is dancing around in a… whatever kind of get-up that is. I\
          \
        don’t even know how to describe it. Anyway, the animation is pretty consistently smooth and good-looking, although they like to notch it up during fight scenes. You’ll rarely see fight scenes as dynamic and sexy as those in Cowboy Bebop. All considered, this anime looks awesome, although not particularly like an anime.\
The cast of characters is also obviously influenced by Western entertainment. Spike, the laidback, goofy badass; Jet, the battle-hardened mechanic and only responsible person on the Bebop; Faye, the tempestuous and self-absorbed woman; they all feel like they were pulled right out of a Western show and animated. Ed is the only exception here – she’s too heavily moe to really be anything but an anime character. The show focuses almost exclusively on developing these four characters’ backstories, and resolving their conflicts from the past. All of them have some sort of important past – Spike and Faye especially – and each episode usually happens to bring those pasts back to them. It makes for a cast of characters that have more depth than many I’ve seen in anime before.\
The story – yeah, that’s right, also pretty Western-influenced. The show is heavily episodic, where each episode contains its own small story that’s resolved by the end, except for a pair of stories that were both spread into two consecutive episodes. However, like I mentioned earlier, these little stories have a tendency of bringing in, with incredible regularity, parts of the several grander, over-arching storylines that pervade the show. What looks at first like it could be just another bounty being tracked down, might somehow actually connect to some part of Jet’s old life, or Faye’s, or Spike’s, or even Ed’s (although I think Ed only has one episode that deals with her past). And if the episode doesn’t do that, then it instead uses that bounty to highlight the issues of the setting – usually political issues, sometimes just personal issues that have been blown out of proportion. Pretty much every episode has another layer of depth and meaning to it (except maybe the mushroom one because I don’t really know what the point of that one was).\
Basically, this anime rocks and you should watch it. It has a startling level of depth and complexity that is uncommon in anime, especially modern anime. The only thing to really look out for is the decidedly non-Eastern style, but I seriously doubt that could ever be a problem. This show is too damn good to dislike for a dumb reason like that.\

    Cowboy Bebop is my favourite anime ever created.I remember the first time I saw it, it was airing on a channel called AnimeCentral in the UK. I was just flicking through channels at the dead of night, as soon as I landed on the channel I was blown away by the sheer brilliance of the soundtrack combining with the animation so perfectly.From that day on I watched it every night, religiously.This show was the whole reason I got into anime.\
STORY (10)\
Cowboy bebop is an episodic anime with a general plot underlying the whole series.The individual episodes have great stories within in them and are all\
          \
        very different form each other and will keep you entertained.The underlying plot is superb, although there are not many episodes that are part of the main plot the story is told brilliantly.You really feel for the characters and personally the end was one of the saddest moments I have ever witnessed.\
MUSIC(10)\
Now, the music of Cowboy Bebop is still the best music you will hear in an anime.The music itself is fantastic but not only that, it goes perfectly with animation and really draws out the emotion from your very soul.Without the music Cowboy Bebop wouldn't be considered the legend that it is today.\
CHARACTERS(10)\
Characters much like the rest of the show are executed fantastically.Each of the characters has their own unique personality and background.They are all likeable, have there own storyline and character development.Cowboy Bebop uses the episodic nature of the show to show all the lives of the people and what they have been through and lets you get to really know the character.\
ART(10)\
The art is absolutely fantastic. Due to its darker colours and faded looks it adds to the general theme of the show as well adds to the more sombre mood of the show.(I don't really know much more about art and this is my first review so forgive me if that bit was a tad short)\
Overall(10)\
This anime is absolutely fantastic and you don't even have to like anime to like Cowboy Bebop as it crosses the boarder into a whole different realm where all the great anime belong and can be appriciated by anyone.This anime is an essential watch for anyone and especially anime fans.This anime will always, personally, be considered the best ever made. But I'm hoping there will be an anime to prove me wrong.But don't forget once you finish this anime You're Gonna Carry That Weight.\

    I normally hate anything with a futuristic theme, but this was different.  The setting, art, and music are all outstanding.  There is a strangely relaxing flow to Cowboy Bebop that makes the series just fly by.

    The basic premise and presentation are evocative of Whedon-san's Firefly, right down to the stand-alone nature of many of the episodes and the lamentable yet appropriate brevity of the series' as a whole. Interactions between the characters are always lively and engaging, and no part of an episode is ever wasted. Everything, even the music, works together to tell the stories of the bounties and the cowboys alike, each episode dovetailing to form a richly populated universe that serves as the stage for the members of the Bebop in their struggles to come to terms with their pasts, their comrades, and their woefully meager cash\

    Wow. If a review starts with a word normally assosciated with epicness or being left speechless, such as wow, it's a pretty good indicator the product, in this case Cowboy Bebop, is going to be fantastic. Believe me, this is one space oddessy you don't want to miss! Let's get on to the review:-\
Story:- Hmm, aahh, what? Yeah, the story is a bit... Mixed, to say the least. I'm 98% certain there's an over-aching story, but most episodes have their own story, which I liked. It meant each episode \"wiped the slate clean\" for want of a better phrase, and made each episode original. One\
          \
        I particularly enjoyed \
*SPOILERS AHEAD, DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED!*\
Was the VHS tape episode, as, it being set in 2071, Spike and Jet had no clue how to use it until they found the 20th C tech otaku. Found it hilarious!\
*SPOILER END!*\
So yeah, the \"umbrella\" story I don't know and don't really understand, but you understand who the good guys and the bad guys are to get a general grip of the show when it comes to it's climatic end. 8/10.\
Art:- The show was produced in 1998, and wow has it aged well! Honestly, I mean, there are many space scenes reminiscient of star wars, with all the lasers and guns in space, but from a hand-drawn perspective (which, of course, the show is set in) I just can't believe the amount of detail! There's all the little control panels in the many ships through the series, to the sprawling landscapes of the different (alien to us) worlds. Speaking of worlds... 9/10.\
Character:- Oh. My. God. The character in terms of the \"feeling\" of the show and the characters themselves were outstanding. As I've just mentioned, the worlds themselves are brilliantly both familiar and alien. The story is set in 2071, and while this seems like an age away, the late teens to mid twenties guys and gals, myself included, this is going to be in our life-time. We'll be old and decrepit, but alive (hopefully). That Tanabe chose this year, that is, so far yet not too far, is brilliant, as it does mean that it strikes that balance of familiarity and unknown. \
Now, the characters themselves. There are many characters, but I'm just gonna touch upon the four protagonists, from my least favourite to my most. Firstly, then, ED. F*cking Ed! Ed is a, hmm, I'm gonna go around 10 or 12 year old girl, who, in classic anime fashon, looks like a boy. One thing that makes him not a boy is the voice! I cringed and had to turn my volume down every time she went hyper which is, well, most of the time. I like her character (a sort of hyper tech otaku) but it was just the voice, in both sub and dub (I watched the show in sub, before a friend recommended dub. WATCH IT IN DUB ENGLISH VIEWERS!). Second is Faye. Faye is a beautiful woman who joins the Bebop (the ship, y'know, space ship, because it's set in space. OVER-CLARIFICATION FTW) team quite early in the show. I had a big break halfway through the show, but I think she joined around episode 10. She jumps in and out of episodes, being prevalent and then not so much, but she's the woman of the team, and is quite strong-willed, witty and just adds the sense of humor achieved by a woman character. She doesn't follow the traditional women view in anime, which is great!\
Next, is a two-way tie, so I'll cover both of them. Spike and Jet, our main protagonists. Jet is Spike's mentor. Not much is known about Jet (except a couple of background episodes, which are NOT flashback episodes, which is always good) but he becomes a loveable character, being a very fatherly figure and caring towards all his crew. I think he owns the Bebop, so he cares very much about the ship too. He also has a fascination with bonsai trees, because why not. Every anime character has to have a wierd fetish, rule #1. For Jet, it's bonsai trees. Hey, he runs the ship, helps out his crew, and cooks. You gotta let him have his moments.\
Lastly, is Spike. I love Spike. He is brilliant. He is a 20-something bounty hunter, and uses his guns, martial art-type moves and quick witts to get him out of his many skirmishes he encounters. Despite being the main protagonist and having some \"bone-head\" moments, he's actually the most philosophical of the team. I'm rambling on and don't want to spoil him, so I'll leave it there. 10/10.\
Sound:- I realize I am rambling on , so this section is going to be short and sweet. All you have to do for this (AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION!) is go on Youtube and type \"Cowboy Bebop OST\" and then sit back, with a optional beverage and snack, and enjoy. You will not be disappointed, trust me. 10/10\
Enjoyment/Overall:- As you've been able to read, I love this show, and will ever be in debt to my best friend who introduced me to the series. However, along with Ed, I have one nitpick. IT'S SLOW! My God, does this show take it's time! Once you get passed, say, the 8 minute mark, it's fine, but this show takes it's sweet. sweet time to get up to speed, then, as per usual, you lose yourself, as you will do in a fantastic anime. Other then that, this is a beautiful, jaw-dropping, action-packed and sometimes sentimental show that will have you laugh,cry, punch the air and rock in the corner all in the space of 5 minutes. Not just a beautiful anime, but an inspiring experience. If ever there was a show to reccommend, it would be this. I can't say it's my favourite, not just because I may find a new favourite, but because I all ready have one, but this is a very close second. Thank you, Tanade, Thank you, Spike, Jet, Faye and even you Ein, Spike's dog. Thank you, Cowboy Bebop. 10/10",

    (I apologize in advance if this review turns out to be terrible) Cowboy Bebop. What's there to say about it other than it being one of the most successful 90's animes in the western hemisphere. Its possible (after watching the series) to understand why people hold it in such high regard. Bebop is nothing short of an amazing series where you have a slew of characters that are just plain fun to watch and who get into situations that are always interesting to see how they turn out. I personally found Bebop to be a fantastic show due to it's characters, atmosphere, and soundtrack. If\
          \
        you're the kind of person to enjoy a good gun-slinging, smooth, and above all else cool anime then you should watch Cowboy Bebop. I can guarantee that you'll be satisfied.",

    Reviews by me go by \"Keep it simple.\" rule so here it is:\
Cowboy bebop is an excellen anime, no doub about that. But what makes it better than the others? Is it the uniqueness of the cahracters or the originality of the style? Or is it by a chance the flow of plot which is subtly injected into an episodic anime?\
All those above are for sure reasons why it is better than the others, but the main reason is actually quite simple: Every time you see the typical\
\"See you space cowboy...\"\
at the end of each episode you just feel the urge to watch the next\
          \
        one.\
To make a long story short :) It is awesome and when it ends u will still want some more :)\
Re-watch: (this is just subjective) Every time I re-watch the anime I have a feeling like I've found something new about the cahracters or the plot... What a strange feeling that is, I can't describe. \

    Very rarely can I give an anime an across the board 10/10 rating. Cowboy Bebop is deserving of such high regard. Followin Spike Spiegel and his crew of bounty hunters about the Cowboy Bebop in a futuristic setting, this anime has a unique feel. It is a mix of the wonder of science fiction, the mystery of classic anime, and that bit of adventure found in many American shows. Yoko Kanno's composition for the soundtrack includes majorly jazz style music, a style not commonly found in anime. Though each episode is its own story, the underlying arc that links it all together leaves the watcher\
          \
        longing to see more. The unexpected ending gives a feeling of completion but still leaves that sliver of a possibility for the story to continue. \
Cowboy Bebop is very similar to the American Scifi show Firefly and it quite likely a source of inspiration for it. Watching Cowboy Bebop is a blast. At times it will put you at the edge of your seat in anticipation and at other points falling to the floor in laughter. Definately a classic masterpiece.\

    what can i say about this one except that its a classic...Arguably the best show i have even seen. Great characters, great plot, classic storytelling, classic music and great direction.\
The best aspect i like about this anime is the simplicity in the portrayal of characters and their behavior in all sequences. The remarkable sections are the comedy ones where no overstressing is used to underline the humour. The humour sequences are simple and to the point and downright funny..they have to be in that avatar. The dark characters are well created and well placed in the plot and no overtures of positivity are introduced in\
          \
        these characters at any point of time which is refreshing. \
I fell in love with the music of the show right from the word go. Jazz rocks! and you've got to be down with that. The sophistication in music is evident from the sounds of the classic jazz orchestras and brass bands. Even the saxophone and harmonica bits played during the scenes and sequences are quite catchy. The build up to one of the great endings that i have ever seen in anime is fantastic. Each character is given color along the way and the show keeps your interest utill the last frame...which is quite a scence really.\
If you havent seen this one...God you are missing a classic.\

    This is an awesome anime! It's probably my all-time most favorite anime. Once in a while I'll go back and watch the last two episodes just so I don't forget why I like it so much.\
The music, for one thing. Seatbelts is an awesome group and I wish I could find some of their non-Cowboy Bebop music because I would definitely listen to it plenty.\
The story is probably the best part in my opinion. How mysterious Spike's past is, and yet how clear it becomes without even having a character recount the occurrences. And then the ending itself, that's something else. I won't spoil anything,\
          \
        but if you see all the stuff that happens in the first 24 episodes then you'll know why the last two are so open-ended.\
Art, geez, that doesn't even need to be said. Some of the visual effects they use can ordinarily only be captured on film, and yet they use most of them to the nth degree. Their portrayal of certain scenes are so perfect that I don't think Hayao Miyazaki himself couldn't have done a better job.\
All in all, 10/10 because it's just that great.\

    Cowboy Bebop, so many memories are etched into my mind from back when I was a kid, though I was relatively young, watching the later episodes on Toonami was a great time. So surreal, tragic and adventurous. \
Story (9)\
Fantastic story, one of which consists of a group ill-fit yet dynamic posse of bounty-hunters traveling though space. People may not like the overall sporadic stories within each episode (or the show itself). However, I found that the chain of events really captured the life of a bounty-hunter. This is described as (to me) people who lost their way, have nowhere to go and are trying to\
          \
        make ends meet in a crazy universe. For me, the show describes a universe of lost belonging, where life is limitless but can be pointless. For this show's time, I believe the range of its adventurous characteristics sparks ones imagination, engrossing them to watch more. The show itself, like really, Cowboys in space, you don't get as original as that. The originality is perfect and I have no clue of any genre that can be as similar and execute this so well. I guess the most prominent message of this anime was how to deal with your haunting past. Everyone has some skeletons in their closet, but sometimes the past might be difficult to cope with. For this, I was really pleased.\
Art (8)\
For the art, I did not expect too much considering when this came out. I love how the art (at least to me) was reminiscent of the past, sort of hazy and incomplete. But the backgrounds were drawn out nicely, setting the mood for each scene perfectly (especially the later episodes). Because of this it flows with the concept of a surreal and curious past. But nonetheless, the art style was memorable and all the other aspects of the anime made up for some of lesser part of the animation.\
Sound (9)\
Let me just inform you that I watched the dub (because my inner child called for it). For a dub, I thought It was great. The characters seemed to match and play well with the schemas of the characters. The voices slipped once in a while but still, I thought the tone and overall VA's played their part well in fitting in with the atmosphere of the anime collectively. I thought there could of been more background audio though, that was a little disappointing. It was almost like the background was nonexistent at times, just unreal, fake and \"dead\". The background audio could of been a bit louder but thats me. Lastly, one thing I remember and will always remember is the OP and ED. Those tunes are symbolic and really caught the anime overall attitude. At the beginning, you're pumped and ready for adventure. The idea of a fast paced life of a space cowboy is etched within this seemingly vintage classic of a song. But at the end, the world is full of regret, the sun is set and is sailing on, leaving behind your past (or are you?). The Real Folk Blues.\
Character (9.5)\
Characters were a great bunch. The mismatch of this group all had their unique and memorable ambiance. Even the nonverbal Ein was amazing. Everyone had a past that was unique and stepped in at some point in the anime. The characters were relatable and I thought were well rounded for the development of the anime. I won't go into character detail because I would like the viewers to analyze and interpret the characters for themselves. \
Enjoyment (10)\
First off, I do not believe that my enjoyment was led astray by childhood memories. The show was addictive, adventurous, funny and tragic at times. A perfect mix that made me want to binge watch the show. However, I knew that I would need to savor this gem to really absorb the material. And Boy I was glad. Watching this anime was really a treat that allowed me to forget my worries and troubles of daily life. It made me smile and it made me wonder. For me, I tend to create a deeper meaning that seems to enhance my appreciation of the Cowboy Bebop. Simply fantastic.\

    One of the all-time anime greats, Cowboy Bebop was a series that went well beyond what to offer up for a 1990s TV anime series in terms of both presentation and storytelling quality. Focused on the exploits of the members of a group of bounty hunters aboard the Bebop spaceship, the series mixes around episodic and ongoing storylines to tell its different tales involving Spike, Jet, Faye, Ein and Ed as they hunt down criminal targets and come to confront tragic elements of their pasts.\
The storytelling approach to Bebop was unique for its time (and still holds up to this day) as many titles in\
          \
        the 1990s either offered an ongoing plot line or focused on episodic developments with its cast. Here in Bebop though, the storytelling focus is more fragmented as episodes are either devoted to exploring the Bebop crew going after a bounty that are mostly self-contained or dealing with issues related to their past that offer more ongoing development as the series progresses, particularly with Spike and Faye's stories. Each episode helps to explore more to the world of the series or flesh out another major element to one of the Bebop crew's developments. They also have varying moods and themes explored throughout the show's run, offering a mix of film noir, westerns, sci-fi, horror, comedy, action, mind screw and drama throughout the show's run. The show is heavily influenced through Western pop culture, and it shows with its homages and parodies to popular Western media franchises and figures like Batman, Gunsmoke, Alien and Bruce Lee.\
Bebop depicts a realistic approach to its sci-fi world, preferring to apply a mix of scientific advances like astral gates and spaceships with settings that closely resemble those found within the modern era unlike the futuristic settings that titles like Akira or Outlaw Star would portray. Planets and moons colonized by humanity look more like modern era cities, each having their own varying issues with criminals, poverty and corruption. In addition, ships like the Bebop and Spike's Swordfish ship are regarded as relics of a past era by those having more modern spaceships via the standards of their time period.\
Visually, Cowboy Bebop is easily among one of the 1990s most impressive looking titles. It offers vast settings that have a good deal of detail and take place in a variety of settings that include space, cities, mountains and sewers. Many characters are drawn with lifelike and realistic details, not sporting the typical “big eyed” anime look you would expect of many titles with characters sporting a variety of looks and some being attractive without going overboard with the looks, like Faye and Spike. Animation is consistently fluid throughout the series and applied in a variety of ways throughout Bebop's run that include physical fights, gun fights, spaceship fights, realistic physics applied to floating in space and evading incoming obstacles like gunfire or wreckage. CG animation is employed for some of the show's more elaborate animated sequences like computer screens and space wreckage, but these bits are rendered so well that they fit seamlessly in with the show's regular animation.\
The soundtrack to Bebop is just as excellent, taking on the same Western influences that the show's storytelling elements employ as it milks use of Western genres like jazz, blues, country and hard rock to flow along with its presentation. Composed by famous anime composer Yoko Kanno, Bebop is easily among one of anime's best soundtracks that you can listen to, whether watching the series or enjoying just the music itself.\
With its high-quality presentation and storytelling that are heavily Western influenced, Cowboy Bebop is easily among the very best offerings that the medium of anime has to offer with its excellent storytelling, visuals, soundtrack and characterization for a TV anime that is easily accessible to both newcomer and veteran alike.\

The setting, which is in the future, is one of my favorite settings in any anime because of its alomst realistic and possible content. I enjoyed this anime very much for the violence as well.

    COWBOY BEBOP: Is this a masterpiece? It depends on how you define the word.\
Cowboy Bebop has received significant attention worldwide that it comes to the point that it has been considered an anime masterpiece. But is this claim justifiable? In my opinion, the term masterpiece is somewhat vague. If it is synonymous to perfect, then I must say that Cowboy Bebop is not a masterpiece at all. It has its own flaws -- like any other story. If it signifies something that is a work of a genius, then Cowboy Bebop’s position becomes debatable.\
The story revolves around Spike, Jet, Faye, Edward, and Ein -- the\
          \
        crew of the Bebop. The series appears to be somewhat episodic, for it doesn’t really follow a solid overall story. It merely talks about the adventures of the crew. One could argue that Spike’s storyline is actually the overall story. But this is apparently not the case, for it is not substantiated enough to be considered as such. At best, it could be called a story arc that is scattered all throughout the series to add mystery to the franchise.\
However, the storytelling is not purely episodic in terms of technicality. It still follows a logical order in the story sequences. What I like about this kind of storytelling is that it gives the viewers different perspectives of the Cowboy Bebop universe. The fact that it doesn’t just follow a single story makes the fictional world more open to exploration. What makes this episodic approach more effective is its ability to give sufficient amount of screen time to each character, so there is a lot of room for character development to take place.\
The crew of the Bebop, I must admit, is very balanced in terms of personality. The characterization of its members is distinct enough for each of the characters to leave an impression -- not to mention that these characters blend well together. Spike is the laidback dude; Jet is the mature and reliable one; Faye is the chic that has a lot of attitude; and Edward is the jolly character who counters the solemn mood. Aside from Edward, each of them has a problematic past, which makes them much more relatable as characters. What makes them even more believable as characters is the fact that they show traits that are beyond their character framework -- like how Faye actually shows a lot of emotion despite her portrayal of being a heartless trickster. It just means that they are not surface-level characters with unique traits just to appear solid; they actually have depth. Even though Edward has no tragic past to make her more concrete, she is not a problematic character. Her role of balancing out the crew is enough to consider her all right.\
I don’t normally tackle music in my anime reviews. I only include it if it is worth noting -- and yes, Cowboy Bebop’s music is worth the notice. Its concentration on jazz and blues gives the series a very distinct atmosphere. And I know that it is impressive when one of the best opening themes of all time is of an anime that has been released in the 90’s!\
So, after everything I have said, is Cowboy Bebop a masterpiece? In its technical aspects, it is debatable that the series is a work of a genius. But it is still not perfect! It is only a matter of defining what masterpiece truly is. I define masterpiece as something that has made a significant impact in its art form or beyond. So, as a personal note, Cowboy Bebop is a masterpiece, just because it has become widely influential not just in the anime scene, but in science fiction in general. That’s enough for me to consider it as such, for, I believe, that defining masterpiece as a perfect work is just absurd.",

    A boy I liked said one day: \"Have you heard 'Tank'? You have to hear 'Tank'.\"  He sent me the album version, and insisted any series with music this good has to be worth a watch.\
Most of the episodes are self contained, and oddly enough, it works.  It is actually easier to get hooked because even though there's a good overarching story with many small details, they're scattered throughout the series and you don't get bogged down with plot point overload.  The characters are consistent and realistic, and gradual changes happen along those oneshot stories.\
At the end of it all, the phenomenal\
          \
        music is the shining star of this series.  Episode Five, \"Ballad of Fallen Angels,\" is one of the best scored episodes of TV.  Period.  Yoko Kanno is a genius; she incorporates such a wide variety of music, and still manages to tie it together.\

    It’s probably pointless to review this series at this point. Cowboy Bebop already has so much acclaim from the Anime community that another positive review would just be so much white noise. The reason I even bother to write this is because, for once, I actually found a series that lived up to its immense hype.\
I don’t want this review to be nothing but comparisons to Samurai Champloo, but seriously, this has “Shinichiro Watanabe” written all over it. The two series feel very similar: a cast of flawed but likable characters, traveling from place to place, getting into trouble and as time goes by we\
          \
        come learn about their mysterious pasts. Jet is the quintessential big brother we all wish we had, Edward is hilarious, (I didn’t really care for Faye, she doesn’t seem to contribute much) and as for Spike? Oh Lord, Spike Spiegel is a BAD-ASS!!! He kicks all kinds of ass, he has a bad-ass spacecraft, and he’s a strong three-dimensional character who does everything with such gravitas. These are the people you wish were your friends in real life.\
Another strong point of the series we can attribute to Watanabe is the atmosphere. The mish-mash of different genres, Western to Sci-fi and everything in between, gives this series an art style that has never been seen before. No other anime has dared to combine cigarettes and spaceships, and I don’t believe any other director could bring this concept to life. But who could supply the sounds necessary to accompany this visual feast? As always, Yoko Kanno delivers. I don’t think the music score is as memorable as Champloo’s, (the exception being “Green Bird” from episode five) but it was the perfect fit and helped to set the tone of the series. Side note: “Tank!” IS the greatest opening theme for an anime ever written.\
As for the voice-acting, I watched the English Dub, and now I understand why this Dub gets so much attention. Not a single character is miscast. Not one. Every random Joe on the street, all the numerous side characters that come and go throughout the series, they all serve their exact purpose: sound realistic while not distracting from what else may be going on. Of course, the real stars of the show are the main characters. These are some of the most believable performances I think I've ever heard. Steve Blum’s role as Spike Spiegel truly speaks for itself. (No pun intended)\
As much as I want to give this series a perfect score, there was one thing that didn’t sit well with me. Whenever I finish watching an anime, I ask myself “so what exactly can I take away from this series?” Honestly, I can’t really find an answer for that question. Perhaps, it will come to me at a later date, but for now I see this series as kind of pointless. By the end of Cowboy Bebop’s run, it doesn’t feel like much has been accomplished. Don’t get me wrong, I loved watching these characters interact; but as a narrative Bebop feels lacking.\
They say it’s not about the destination; it’s about the journey itself, and this jazzy space odyssey was one hell of a journey. Cowboy Bebop was loved in its time, it’s loved now, and it will continue to be loved far into the future. You owe it to yourself to watch this series.\

    My favorite thing about Cowboy Bebop is how motley of a crew they all are and the interaction between characters. The action is ok but nothing special. But character development is where this anime really excels. They pretty much go into everyone's backstory well enough to give you a good idea of what makes them tick. \

    Finding the words to describe Cowboy Bebop proved to be more difficult than I imagined. The series is a true masterpiece of animation and one of few that genuinely deserves a 10 rating across the board.\
Of all the elements in the show, the one worthy of special mention is the music score, composed by Yoko Kanno. It is undoubtedly some of the most atmospheric music of any series and one the show is best known for.\
The plot is nonlinear. While each character has an underlying agenda, it is their environment that ultimately decides where life takes them. Scripting for the show is exceptional; episodes are\
          \
        nicely varied and the dialogue is very well-written and spoken from the mains to the supporting.\
Besides the music, the next most recognizable aspect of the series is the characters. Each and every one of them has a meticulous design and personality, backed with outstanding art, fluid animation and excellent voice acting. All of this, combined with the aforementioned material, comes together in the form of realistically fleshed out and convincing figures.\
Cowboy Bebop, in every regard, is a show of excellence. It more than backs its legacy and name among anime with painstaking visuals, beautiful music and believable characters. A must watch.\

So I finally sat down at my computer to watch most of the series and I must say I was very impressed, everything from the beginning to the end was well done, the artwork, the music, the story.

    Cowboy Bebop was about the second anime I ever watched.  I never could catch it all the time when it was on Adult Swim but thanks to online episodes and movie rentals I finally got to see it all about two years ago.  What caught my attention was the art.  The art is more real to life than some anime and really spoke to me.  The sound tract was great, I even hunted down and bought the OST.  The characters were unique and worked well together in the crazy futuristic setting.  The story was good over all and several\

For me, the strongest part of an anime must be the charactors. This show has very strong and likable characters. They have excellent back stories and they seem like they are real people. \
All of the stylistic elements are amazing. I loved the music, the anime and the different variety you get with the story arcs. \
One aspect of this show that I liked was the resolution. There is a part at the end where one of the characters leaves the group. That is\

        kinda sad, but it is life. Some people stay and some go. Also there is a definitely conclusion to this anime. I think that is so healthy and true. Lots of times we get second seasons, but we shouldn't. Tell the story, take the viewers to some fun places and end the series. \

    if you do not know Cowboy Bebop you are not a true anime fan. I mean millions of anime fans have watched this anime even actors have watched this anime. That's right! Even American actors have even watched this anime. I mean if you even look at the anime trailer you will get super hooked. When I watched this anime I was super hooked. What? You say it's not that popular and I don't have this anime as one of my favorites. Well there's other stuff I like ok you don't have to judge. Anyways reasons you should watch this anime well, I told you\
          \
        that your favorite American actors like this anime. We also got the story which I won't spoil it for you someone else will do that but, storyline is glorious. Art style is kind of good if you like 90's anime. Sound is quite good although dub is actually better than the sub like damn! Characters got some good badass history. (mostly Spike Spiegel) It is entertaining to watch all the way and, overall might be a pretty badass anime besides all the other good anime the 90's has given us as well. Well that concludes why you should watch Cowboy Bebop trust me if your a guy or gal who doesn't like anime then watch it anyways. (besides if you don't like anime why are you even on this website?)\

    It didn't quite hit me until the show ended just how much I took the interactions and journey between Spike, Faye, Jet , and Ed. The journey was a fun one and there was always something going on and the characters were the ones who always shined. The story was good and tended to go in a non episodic format which really worked. Even more impressive were the characters. They were all lovable and had something they were chasing.\

This is one of those perfect shows that will make you cry, laugh, anxious, and feel all the emotions that a masterpiece like this can bring out of a person. \

  synopsis = "In the year 2071, humanity has colonized several of the planets and moons of the solar system leaving the now uninhabitable surface of planet Earth behind. The Inter Solar System Police attempts to keep peace in the galaxy, aided in part by outlaw bounty hunters, referred to as \"Cowboys.\" The ragtag team aboard the spaceship Bebop are two such individuals. Mellow and carefree Spike Spiegel is balanced by his boisterous, pragmatic partner Jet Black as the pair makes a living chasing bounties and collecting rewards. Thrown off course by the addition of new members that they meet in their travels—Ein, a genetically engineered, highly intelligent Welsh Corgi; femme fatale Faye Valentine, an enigmatic trickster with memory loss; and the strange computer whiz kid Edward Wong—the crew embarks on thrilling adventures that unravel each member's dark and mysterious past little by little. Well-balanced with high density action and light-hearted comedy, Cowboy Bebop is a space Western classic and an homage to the smooth and improvised music it is named after. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
