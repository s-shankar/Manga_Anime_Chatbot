He decides to put his new skill to good use by becoming a hero. However, he quickly becomes bored with easily defeating monsters, and wants someone to give him a challenge to bring back the spark of being a hero. Upon bearing witness to Saitama's amazing power, Genos, a cyborg, is determined to become Saitama's apprentice. During this time, Saitama realizes he is neither getting the recognition that he deserves nor known by the people due to him not being a part of the Hero Association. Wanting to boost his reputation, Saitama decides to have Genos register with him, in exchange for taking him in as a pupil. Together, the two begin working their way up toward becoming true heroes, hoping to find strong enemies and earn respect in the process. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=260,  ["text"]="              \n    Onepunchman, the story of the great hero Saitama, an unemployed guy who found his career in being a superhero, after training for three years he achieved great power, sadly for him, he manages to destroy any enemy in just one punch, rending him bored and empty.\nStory: Simple and direct action manga, overpowered Hero fights enemies, but he's attitude while doing it compliments so much the comedy.\nArt: Murata Yusuke, amazing artist who worked in a lot of big names before, he's clear trace makes every page enjoyable, great detail in the images and clarity for understanding what exactly is happening in each page.\nCharacters: Saitama, main character\n          \n        and protagonist of the story,not finding thrill in battles anymore has left him bored and simple, he lacks any reaction to any enemy/monster/destroyer of worlds, with a smile and a positive attitude he looks for a goal. Genos, sidekick, serious cyborg who thinks he found a teacher in Saitama now follows in the hope of becoming as powerful as him, the characters balance each other quite well (This's been written around chapter 18 surely others will appear later)\nEnjoyment: Personally, I have had a great time reading this manga, I look up for each new character and I'm sure a lot of people do too. It's easily inexplicable how the story feels fresh again when the characters feel almost too powerfull (Think how goku would be if he had the level at the end of DB-GT during DB)\nOverall :I will recommend this to any fan of superheroes, comedy or action.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=108,  ["text"]="             \n    It's seriously the best. You are doing yourself an extreme disservice if you don't sit down and read that Onepunch greatness. The plot's plastered literally everywhere so let's just go ahead with the usual breakdown thing that seems to be the way to go on mal. Welcome to the glorious anti-stereotypical battle manga, ONEPUNCH M\nStory-7\nIt's not gonna blow you out of the water with an extreme level of intricately detailed depth and massive psychological implications, but this is literally one of a TINY number of instances where I couldn't care less if I actually put considerable conscious effort into doing so. Story for the most\n          \n        part flows well and has enough bubbling (or violently exploding) away at any one time to keep me interested. \nArt-10\nYeah. 10. It's just that downright astoundingly nice to look at. Character designs are interesting and extremely detailed, backgrounds are amazing and there are literally bits you can string into a gif image and have yerself a small piece of absurdly fluid (coming from a manga at least) animation. Our beloved MC here is the only one who's drawn horribly-but that's part of the joke. He generally looks like he's drawn in Microsoft paint, but when he shifts to a serious art syle you know shit is about to go DOWN. Best art I've seen in a very long time.\nCharacter-10\nThis is one of those things that's probably hit or miss depending on your tastes, but I personally LOVE these characters. Saitama is our MC and super-OP badass mofo who people don't take seriously cause he's bald and walks around in tights and a cape-you'll probably grow to love him as he makes mountains out of molehills (ie:missing a convenient sale at the shops while killing bad guys) and generally not caring in the slightest about things that seemingly actually matter. There's Genos, the also extremely badass and super-attractive fangirl bait who possesses a plethora of crazy robotic arm attachments for taking care of the toughest jobs, and a host of other heroes ranging from licenceless rider, a dude on a bike who rides around fighting crime, to guys like Bang and Metal Knight, Also super-OP and awesome. Vibrant cast who grew on me faster than most.\nEnjoyment-Gotta be 10 man, Onepunch is the biggest breath of fresh air I've had in a while as it stubbornly wages it's one-man war on shonen battle manga. If you're sick of shitty tropes and garbage plot devices, prepare to see them mocked relentlessy in a setting where the action and characters still manage to dwarf most other battle manga.\nI'm gonna go with like 9.5/10\nThis be mah jam.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=59,   ["text"]="            \n    Fantastic piece of work made by two incredible people. \nStory (9) - OPM breaks the typical hero manga pattern even though it's all about heroes. It isn't just about saving the world while saving the girl and beating the poop-head that wants to kill everybody. No. It's about how funny and exciting it could be to save the world as a hobby. Everything's over the top and does't shy away from anything. There's not much plot, but definitely has the potential to develop one. Overall, it's the type of story that's just honestly entertaining and keeps you at the edge of your seat. Excellent.\nArt (10)\n          \n        - Murata Yusuke-san was the whole reason I got into the manga. He's a phenomenal artist in every way - color, lines, details, variety, technique, story-telling... I could keep listing them for days if I have to. His character designs are on a whole nother level; each and every character has a look that's great on their own right. Murata also has a way of making big things even bigger, and epic things seem god-like - perfect for something like OPM.\nCharacter (8) - Saitama is not your typical hero. He's unmotivated and extremely strong from the start. He's not extremely righteous but he's admirable enough that's he's hero-worthy. You can look up to him, make fun of him, and identify with him at the same time even though he's an odd character on so many levels. On the other hand, the other characters seem to fit with your typical hero-story themes: the valiant, the wicked, the haughty, the modest...etc. Seeing their interplay with Saitama is a great sight. Overall, though not very complex, the characters are undeniably interesting.\nOne-Punch Man is definitely something to watch out for in the future. Even though it's only been out for a couple of years, it's already such a powerhouse; it has great potential so I'm expecting a lot. A must read of shounen/action/hero-manga enthusiasts.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=41,   ["text"]="             \n    At first glance, Onepunch-Man looks like a typical action manga. But look into it just a little more, and you’ll discover just how different it is.\nFor one, the main character is the ‘caped baldy’ known as Saitama. His appearance is somewhat bland, but there’s a reason: He’s so strong that all his hair fell out. How strong? Well, he ends all his fights with one punch (hence the manga’s name). He’s presumably a parody of all those overpowered protagonists you see in anime and manga, but his uninterested personality is quite unique for an action hero.\nimage\nEarly on in the series, a cyborg who becomes Saitama’s\n          \n        student is introduced. His name is Genos, and he’s definitely powerful with his cybernetic weaponry and armour. He has that handsome appearance that makes him look like the protaganist, when he’s really just the student of the protagonist. Genos is also more serious and apparently smarter than Saitama, but Saitama doesn’t seem to be bothered.\nOnepunch-Man features many villains, and a lot of them are seemingly unstoppable until Saitama gets to them. There’s a giant, an insect swarm and ‘seapeople’, for example. One recurring villain, Sonic, doesn’t fall under the same category as these monsters, but that’s because he’s kind of important.\n Eventually, an organization full of heroes comes into the story, which Saitama and Genos join. Heroes are ranked in a system going from C-class to S-class. Many heroes appear in the story, with their ranks and abilities varying (amongst them, there’s an esper, a shiny muscleman and a guy in a dog costume). Once this group is introduced, the fight scenes become all the more epic.\nimage\nSpeaking of fights, there are a lot of them in this manga. And they are drawn with great detail: They are better quality than the rest of the series, which looks decent at its worst. You may think it’s boring when Saitama wins with one punch, but here’s the thing: He usually only appears late into fights with other heroes involved, and his punches usually have to actually hit to do anything. So fight scenes are really hype-filled when they want to be.\nThe story of Onepunch-Man… Well, I can’t tell if it’s serious or comedic. I’m guessing it’s both, as it can be funny one minute and intense the next. Each villain has their own motive, some of them based on their past. And there are some heroes that definitely don’t act like heroes. The author is quite interesting, to say the least.\nIn conclusion, Onepunch-Man is a great series. Read the manga, then watch the anime by Madhouse when it starts."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=30,   ["text"]="            \n    Story: 10, very original story about a superhero who is so powerful he's nearly a god. Really reminds me of playing any video game where it's just way too easy and not challenging, or other cliché manga characters that quote \"yes... I've been waiting for a challenge for years, finally someone to fight\". Each arc makes me feel like \"holy shit maybe this time Saitama will get a challenge\", but at the end it's always a disappointment, thus I feel the deep connection with Saitama. I feel the same alongside him. My feels. \nArt: 8, the characters and fight scenes are pretty amazing, villains are\n          \n        extremely detailed and the style is unique in its own, not so much Japanese, the author has his own design. The main protagonist is purposely drawn in a simplistic way to demonstrate how mundane and boring his life is. \nCharacter: 8, there are only 24 chapters out right now, I've read 16 so far so it's a pretty new manga. Character development takes time, after reading the first few chapters I've grown keen to Saitama. Very unforgettable protagonist. Villains are pretty cliché though, although very entertaining. It's superhero themed so expect mad scientists, aliens, ninjas, over the top shit etc. \nEnjoyment: 10, I've read 16 chapters straight and I really like it, I'm just taking my time from my lil interlude manga reading break to write this review. The humor is verrrrry funny, ironic, over the top and just my sense of funny:) just go read it. You won't regret it unless you simply dislike sci-fi / superheros which isn't the point of the story. \nOverall: 9, pretty awesome manga so far, I'll need to update this review later since the manga itself is pretty much brand new. Go read it. \n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=27,   ["text"]="          \n    One Punch Man is a superhero comic, a genre I've never really got on with. Thankfully One Punch Man falls into that category of superhero comic that fully realises how silly the whole superhero idea is. It tells the story of Saitama, a man who trained so hard at becoming a superhero that he became really strong. So strong that he ends every single fight in a single punch.\nThe central joke to One Punch Man is that Saitama is so powerful that he's bored. Nothing poses a threat to him anymore so he just sort of wanders through life in a mild unimpressed sulk. He\n          \n        shows up on the scene of the crime a little bit late because sure what's the rush anyway, listens to the villain blabber on about how they are the strongest for a bit, before eventually getting tired of that and punching them through the nearest wall.\nJust having Saitama show up and punch dudes in the face would get old pretty quickly. What makes it click as a joke is how unassuming he is. His superpower didn't come from magical beings or being rich or anything. He just did lots of push-ups and sit-ups. He's a bit of a loser really. His superhero costume is a yellow jumpsuit and red kitchen gloves. He looks like a man play-acting superhero, which is kind of what he is doing. Plus he just looks silly, with his blank bored expression and bald head, which is why it's just inherently funny to see him surprise these superpowered hyper-evolved beings with that big dopey face of his and immense strength.\nThat's...sort of it. For something that has been getting as much praise heaped on it as One Punch Man has, I'm surprised at how little there was to it. It feels like a Saturday morning kids cartoon, having more in common with Powerpuff Girls than anything else. Not a bad thing, but still rather shallow and hard to get invested in. It's difficult to care about anything that happens when there's no tension. Because Saitama is so ridiculously overpowered, none of the fights have any doubt about what the final result will be. The author tried to introduce some challenge for Saitama to overcome by introducing the superhero levelling system, but Saitama is so lackadaisical about life that if he can't bring himself to really care about events, then neither can I.\nThere's only 3 volumes out at time of writing, but you'll breeze through that in barely more than an hour. There's very little dialogue and most of the jokes are visual anyway. The artwork is pretty great. The over-designed villains and other superheroes fit with the theme the story is going for. Everyone else looks like majestic beings of frightening power and destruction, while Saitama just looks like some prat in his pajamas. But it does have a tendency to get repetitive. Yes it was hilarious the first time 10 pages in a row were double spreads of the camera swooping around Saitama as his enemy encircled him. But repeat that once every few chapters and it loses its effect. There was one chapter that consisted almost entirely of the cyborg character doing a transformation sequence on his arm to unleash its super charger laser. I appreciate the sentiment of over-dramatising what everyone does, but it loses its effect when you do it too often.\nOne Punch Man is very easy to like, but its shallowness and speed at which you'll fly through it makes it feel like real throwaway entertainment. The only thing that really stuck with me is the burning question of what would happen in Saitama punched himself in the face.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=21,   ["text"]="          \n    Ah, that feeling of boredom eating away at you when you have godlike stats in your game. Or just passing any test in school with no sweat. That's what Saitama, our protagonist in this action shounen manga, similarly felt when all of his enemies, big or small, fast or slow, all fall down, or worse dissipate into thin air, with one punch. Yes, 1 punch is all it takes, and thus the title of this manga. Worse of all, he is being underestimated because of his mundane looks and attire, like some crappy '80s superhero in tights. It doesn't even help that he joins an\n          \n        organization of heroes who look down on him too. And thus we follow his story of looking for his best contender in the whole universe!\nAt first one may be put off with Saitama's character design because of his looks, to some it may be enough to detract themselves from reading this manga, and his looks greatly contrasts with his newfound sidekick Genos, a white-haired bishie cyborg with equipment that can rival Iron Man's who wants to be trained under Saitama's tutelage, as well as other heroes and villains who have way too cool designs and gadgets with them. But this is okay, because it is compensated by the great variety of designs, and even the details of their hands are different. \nAs for the characters themselves, you can't help but feel for Saitama, who even though strong, is left with a boring superhero life. Genos' development is such that he realizes his cyborg body may not be enough to defeat all those who stand in his way, and thus he strives to improve himself as Saitama's sidekick, much to the master's chagrin. Villains though are cliched, and are rather made to prove that Saitama overpowers them in a match. Even so, their interactions with each other are hilarious, especially when Saitama knocks them out.\nAll in all, the enjoyment factor is very high for a shounen manga, and albeit the battle scenes are quite short when Saitama enters the fray, the panels are very detailed to the point that one panel of their movement encompasses one page. Which brings us to what I think is a minor problem here. I don't know if this is one of the mangaka's quirks but detailing one page with only one movement frame of the character could slow down the pace of the manga indeed, in fact in one scene it took 2 chapters to finish one villain, and with one punch too. Nevertheless, if this is intended by the mangaka, I think it is really original for such a medium. \nAnyway, if you're into action shounen, then Saitama's antics will make your day complete! Not to mention sympathizing with him when he feels down as his day comes to an end knowing he didn't met yet his rightful rival.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="            \n    Did you ever use to look up to and idolize famous superheroes from comic books when you were growing up? Did guys like Superman, Batman or maybe Captain America get your blood pumping? Well let me tell you they're all a bunch of sissies compared to Saitama, the REAL superhero who will utterly annihilate anything and everything with a single punch of his fist.\nOne Punch-Man is a hilarious manga about a bald, completely average unemployed guy named Saitama whom after three years of hard training ended up becoming a superhero... as a spare-time hobby. However he still ended up bored and disappointed, because even the\n          \n        most monstrous apparitions gets completely blown to smithereens if he merely punches them once.\nThis manga is basically one big parody of classic superhero comics like the Marvel and DC Universes. One Punch-Man is primarily a comedy manga at heart, but it certainly does so in style and above all in a very fresh and unorthodox manner of fashion. Saitama is *completely* overpowered here, but his non-caring attitude towards his \"occupation\" and the monologues he has are just hilarious to read. There are plenty of other characters in this manga as well of course, the majority of which are other superheroes, all with their own ridiculously silly names and character settings which are also clearly just making fun of the entire superhero trope.\nThe other thing that's so great about this manga is the artwork. It's simply brilliant, like really surprisingly so. The artist, Murata Yusuke, clearly knows when to be serious and when not to be. When the manga is being funny, then the art style is very exaggerated and fitting, but when it gets into the large-scale action scenes for example then suddenly it looks freaking epic! There are chapters which consist solely of double-page panels depicting high definition visuals of planets, cityscapes, spaceships, superpowers in action, slow-motion shots and god knows what else. It looks absolutely fantastic.\nOverall, One Punch-Man is a very fresh take on an otherwise quite overused concept. The unorthodox yet incredibly likable protagonist, the great comedy and parody aspects as well as the very crisp artwork together make up an extremely entertaining manga that will both impress you and make you laugh hysterically.\nIf you like series with action, super powers and a brilliant sense of humour, then this is for you.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="          \n    Its been quite a while since I read this manga, so might aswell I review it.\nOnepunch-man is a superhero manga. A genre that im not really into it, but its not a regular super hero  like marvel, it has some twist in it. It tells the story of Saitama, a man who trained so hard at becoming a superhero that he became really strong. So strong that he ends every single fight in a single punch.\nIn this world superhero is a job, needless to say you got to do some good deeds such as catches a robber or even fight the mysterious being. Oh\n          \n        yea I forgot to mention theres some monsters too in this world that appeard all the time.\nOur main character here named saitama is a superhero for hobby, he’s a superhero himself but he forgot to apply to the super hero associations so he did not make any outcome out of  it until he met a cyborg who’s strong aswell, then both of them joins the hero association together. \nSo from the title \"One punch man\" we could assume what kind of power he has, yep. He ends any fight with a single punch. That’s the central joke to onepunch man. Saitama is so powerful that he’s bored. Unlike any other franchise such as dbz or even sword art online, they got a suspense but it’s a false suspense since the maincharacter is OP asfuck. One punch man has no suspense at all because he defeats any monster with a single punch. Theres no logical explanation of why is he OP asfuck, but he once mention that he trains physically for over 3 years, but is that really the reason why he is strong as he is rightnow? That’s not really plausible. \nI’m well aware that one punch-man is an action comedy genre type of thing. Its not a shows based on a logical thinking. But just having Saitama show up and punch dudes in the face would get old pretty quickly. What makes it click as a joke is how unassuming he is. He's a bit of a loser really. His superhero costume is a yellow jumpsuit and red kitchen gloves. He looks like a man play-acting superhero, which is kind of what he is doing. Plus he just looks silly, with his blank bored expression and bald head, which is why it's just inherently funny to see him surprise these superpowered hyper-evolved beings with that big dopey face of his and immense strength.\nOver all Onepunch-man is a refreshing manga, I had a good laugh with it. The art is amazingly done and fits well the manga. Despite all the flaws it didn’t really hurts my enjoyment. I would rate this manga 7.6/10 with an 8.5/10 enjoyment level. "},

Although the super heroes and villains somewhat feel similar to the old series, the great art combined with interesting dialogues and hilarious situations makes this series a rather unique and refreshing reading experience.

I have read all of or part of at least 1000-1200 works. Yeah yeah \"so what your opinions are garbage etc.\" OK, so I am sure we might disagree on some taste, or even a lot of taste, and maybe dropping the amount I read just means I waste my time to you. The only reason I belabor the point is that I knew within less than 2 chapters that this was 100% going to excite\n          \n        me more than anything had excited me before.\nThis manga is a remade, improved version of a comic that was being released on a personal page with much lazier and frankly worse art. The original version already had the merits to stand out on the story, character, and comedy front on its own.\nMost comedy works need constant gags or to go ten leaps beyond absurd to work. When you take \"Superman\" and remake him from an uptight, boring dork obsessed with morality into an amoral, laid back, selfish, very human character, then you do not need to do much more to establish a comedic atmosphere. It helps to have an author who is great at creating a mishmash of weird villains and weird heroes to throw at him over and over though. \nThe action bits of the story are a bit more cliched. While the superhero constantly powering up is not as much of a feature since he already starts out at max power, the constant level up of enemies is probably going to keep being a driving feature of the manga's action. What keeps it from devolving down into speeches of friendship or repetitive fights is the great feel for creating an incredible variety of monsters...no matter how the story plays out, it is going to be impossible for it not to keep being fun. With the art porn level added to the monsters in this version, they have become even more distinctive. In the original the monsters were mostly funny/quirky, but with the touches added in the remake stand all time with any of the best villains in any work.\nNow I talked about the original version, and as of writing this review it is not listed on MAL, so I know that might be confusing. This version is a remake after the great artist working on this contacted the original author to work with him. So you add pornographically amazing art to a work that already has the merit to stand on its own and an incredible sense of fun to it...and well from there you basically get a manga with the most unlimited potential ever. \nStories are more than just art, or being funny, or being \"epic\". They are usually character driven, and obviously some people may not identify with Superman (Saitama), his robit sidekick, or the \"wacky ensemble\" of people who constantly come to fight and annoy him, only to later end up sticking to him like glue. All I can say is that the writing is superb, and I think that there is a good job of giving them all personalities. My favorite character from the original has not been introduced yet IIRC (the overpowered psychic's little sister) except for the character art, and I am excited just thinking about how fun she will be in this version.\nI am going to close like I opened, with another emotional argument instead of something more reasoned. I never cry, and if any other manga were cancelled for health reasons, I would not even really be sad - stories are beautiful fun, but they are just stories. If this manga had to end before finishing its entire run, I would definitely cry like a fucking baby. I may not have presented enough credible reasons why this is the best, I really wish I could think of more to say, since no manga deserves more gushing praise than this one.\n        "},

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="          \n    One-Punch Man is just like what the title sounds - A main character who can literally one punch kill everything. Now , what's the fun about an overpowered BALD main character who can defeat gargantuan monsters and meteorites in just a punch ? Everything. One-Punch Man is a series that deviates from the general shounen rule of : New enemy comes out and destroys the main character , leading the main character to train and power up and repeat. This makes it utterly fresh to the eyes and this is not a manga to be taken seriously because of it and the sheer idiocy of\n          \n        this made the enjoyment so much better than its peers.\nStory : 5/10\nThe story is pretty linear. One-Punch Man basically revolves around a boy named Saitama who defends cities after cities from evil overbearing monsters aiming for world domination and the sorts. He literally one punches everything and everything would be solved , but this was the problem. He was too overpowered that he had already lost the motivation to fight any more because everything just ends in one punch. But that was not the case forever since the readers are shown his past where he was not yet BALD and looked like an eggplant head , showing that he was actually weak even before the series started and had trained for years just to achieve his power today.\nBut even so , after defending so many cities , he remained unknown as a hero and a fellow hero , upon seeing his retarded power begged to be his disciple and both of them took on the tests to become official heroes. The storyline is basically like that , sweet and simple with Saitama trying to achieve his well-deserved S-ranked Hero class. There are hardly any plot twists or any sub plots other than this simple storyline which made the storyline suffer just a little bit.\nArt : 7/10\nOne glance at Saitama and you would be wondering , ' What the hell am I watching ? '. It's simply because Saitama is a character that looked as though an elementary school kid could draw easily because of his simple design that could even put One Piece's characters to shame. However, the author had shown that he had purposefully did that to Saitama's character design and it's evident that he could draw masterful pieces of art if you'd compare the other characters , especially the bosses of each arc. The amount of details spent on each bosses are exceptional as they looked as though they were ripped out from Gantz , which is renowned for its high quality drawings that looked realistic compared to its peers.\nCharacter : 4/10\nEach character are given a set of personalities but this is really where the series is lacking. Although there are several characters introduced throughout the series , one could not help but think that these characters were merely introduced just so that they can hype up the arc's boss - in other words , flaunting of it's power before Saitama one punches it like usual. So far of most characters that had been introduced , most of them fall under this category sadly to say and Saitama's disciple , Genos , which is arguably the series' second main character is not spared from this.\nHowever with that said, not all characters are just fodder-type material as although Genos fall under the category as stated above , he was given ample character development and serve well as the secondary character because Saitama is usually absent until he decides to show up just to deliver the final blow and the humour of Genos taking the credit because of the civilians watching their fight is overused , yet it's still funny to see Saitama being irked and pissed about it.\nEnjoyment : 9/10\nThis is where the series truly shines because it's original and gives the readers a break from the usual shounen power ups as stated in the introductory paragraph. The story is predictable and yes , Saitama would just one hit everything but it's extremely enjoyable to see him being distressed about his own power. And the back story given of why Saitama lost all of his hair and became a bald eggplant was hilarious and his superbly simple design would probably paint a smile on one's face. The series is clichéd beyond hope but for some reason , the readers are able to enjoy it and it's something that cannot be described through words but rather only could be explained by reading it.\nOverall : 7/10\nI originally wanted to give this series a 6 out of 10 but I simply had to add one point because of the sheer enjoyment I had through reading it. I would definitely recommend this series to people who are tired of seeing convenient power ups from other popular shounen series because the concept of an overpowered main protagonist that is distressed because of his own power is fresh.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="           \n    After completing the anime, I couldn't just leave One Punch Man there, I had to have ALL that was available! So I picked up the manga from somewhere between chapter 20 - 30 and read right up to the latest chapter. \nUltimately it was a bit of a disappointment, if I'm honest. While heavy amounts of action is great for animation (well if the animation is actually good, which it is for this show) for manga it has you longing for substance as you breeze through every chapter in seconds. There is little in the way of substantial dialogue and no real story to speak\n          \n        off, just fight scene after fight scene. I caught up with this manga in a matter of hours over the course of several days and only because I physically went out of my way limit my reading so I didn't just blow through it all in like five minutes. The action is at least epic and very well drawn, some manga make it very hard to tell what is happening or to really get a sense of motion from the images, but One Punch Man is extremely kinetic. \nSadly the other problem is the heroes are kinda well... bland. I mean don't get me wrong, there are plenty of badasses in the roster but compared to all the crazy monsters it's a shame that the heroes are mostly just martial artists in silly costumes. Because of how little real, genuine, variation can be found between the powers of the heroes they have to forcibly introduce a hero ranking system but it still doesn't really do a great job of identifying who we're really meant to take seriously. In the top ranking \"S\" heroes we have fire throwing cyborgs, people with quite literal superpowers rubbing together shoulder to shoulder with a man in a dog costume and someone who fights with a bat. They are a big deal because they are, apparently. \nThe bottom line is that One Punch Man is very fun and well drawn, but I'd only recommend reading this if you can't handle leaving this world after only twelve episodes. It's a shame, really.\n        "},

As a result, Saitama has becoming incredibly strong (and bald) and is able to end every fight with just a single punch. He thirsts for the exciting rush of combat. The problem is...he's too strong? \nOne Punch-Man takes a comical yet thought provoking look at strength, justice, and ambition. It's thoroughly enjoyable to watch the heroes struggle to defeat a villain just to have Saitama walk in and finish it off in one, effortless punch. His strength and his never-ending struggle to find an opponent who can survive a single punch leads him to\n          \n        great frustration, despite seeming to be an average guy at first. \nOne Punch-Man also takes on the typical good-and-evil struggle as well as the theme of ambition. Watching Saitama take Genos under his wing (although it wasn't really a choice) is interesting. The different ambitions and ideals of the heroes can lead to hilarious and thought provoking moments, be it running in fear at pathetic looking fish creatures, or refusing to help out a civilian in need, almost every little hero you see has a personality that'll make you laugh or turn your nose in disgust.\nThe art in One Punch-Man would probably be one of it's weaker points out of all it's strengths. It's not bad, but it's nothing to be really proud of. It's just...normal. Nothing wrong with that. What I do like about the art is that certain characters are drawn to fit their personalities. Genos is over-detailed in order to fit his dutiful and perfectionist nature. Saitama looks like he was ripped out of some poorly-drawn sketchbook in order to align with his \"average\" facade and for quite a bit of comical effect. Heroes and villains are drawn appropriately whether they think they're god or they're afraid of the smallest thing.\nAs of right now, there hasn't been a great deal of character development, but you can really see it forming at the edges. Saitama, for the most part, seems to be a static character that the story revolves around (maybe he'll find a worth opponent). Speed of Sound Sonic (mind the long name) may one day lose a bit of his ego, and Genos might realize the cowardice and pride of his peers. What do I want to see the most? Personally, I find the Saitama's struggle with his own strength to be one of the most interesting and enjoyable aspects of this manga. \nI have to say that this manga is a real surprise to me. Out of the many superhero based mangas that try to beat each other, One Punch-Man effortlessly rises above the competition in a single punch. Out of the many mangas that I am following, One Punch-Man is the most entertaining and enjoyable. Anyone who is looking for a refreshing and funny manga should not hesitate to pick this up.\n        "},

Simply put, it's a story about heroes battling against villains. Onepunchman add gimmick such as hero rank system, which shows how the heroes regulated by government. Nothing mindblowing but for an omnipotent hero like Saitama, this actually could build a sense of growth which I don't expect from one-hit-kill main char.\nArt-10\nYuusuke Murata providing a generous amount of action scene for this series. No really, when you see action it means real ACTION. 18-20 page for weekly release are just not enough to capturing the awesomeness that put other battle mangas to shame.\n          \n        Arts, details, drawing techniques; IMO it's handsdown the best among manga, or (on some chapters) even comparable to high-end OVA.\nCharacter-9\nThe diversity of character in OPM is enormous. Major character are consist of heroes though since most monsters/villains are gonna be one-hit-Ko'ed anyway. The main char Saitama portrayed as somehow indifferent hero, neither openly shows hot-blooded sense of justice nor having no justice at all. This generates a pivot point for diverse kind of heroes that appears in the story. \nEnjoyment-10\nI highly enjoy this series. Rather than push pull battle scene which showing U-turn win-lose-win pattern, it just show how the protagonists win the battle. If 1 hit is all we need to beat the opponent, why do we need to throw new fancy techniques each chapter just to be countered by the opponent on the next chapter? Even 1 hit kill could be interesting if it compensated in another department, on this case OPM leads huge margin by the detailed drawing of battle scenes.\nOverall-9\nAn exemplary of what a battle manga could achieve. So smooth that you could breeze over the chapter in just a few seconds, but without reducing reader's interest to re-read again.\n        "},

Season 2 wasn't going to come out for some time and I couldn't wait.\nI was not disappointed. This marked the first time I stayed up very late to read a manga, heck, the first time I stayed up late to read at all in a long while. One Punch Man (OPM) as a manga is highly entertaining, with a plethora of fights that are brilliantly illustrated in such a way that you can easily imagine their happening in real-time. They're very fluid. The powers of these heroes/monsters are epic.\n          \n        I love how when a new hero appears his/her name is shown with his/her class and rank. One of the aspects of shounen that really make you want to keep watching is the aura of mystery surrounding strong characters -- even after having caught up with the manga, I still don't know about the abilities of some key players that will definitely play an important role later on.\nOne may say that OPM has too many fights once it gets into its main plot, but its main plot is such that many fights are bound to occur, and besides, it all contributes towards ONE's motif of what it means to be a hero. Like its rival, Boku no Hero Academia, OPM is a tale of heroism for a protagonist who defies the odds, albeit in a different way. And unlike the fights in Bleach, for example, those in OPM do not consist mostly of talking and using the same modes of dialogue over and over again. The hero(s) and monster(s) meet, fight, and an outcome is established. I do criticize the scarcity of hero deaths (although there are plenty of hero injuries) in comparison with the myriad monster deaths. However, it would certainly shake the mood if heroes were to die, and usually if \"good guys\" die they only do so for a reason.\nI'm primarily an anime viewer (52.2 days of anime, 0.9 of manga) so I can't really say this with backing -- but of the manga I've been reading so far, OPM is one of the best illustrated. The attention to detail is insane. To think that this actually began as a webcomic that's still going, which was converted into a manga, which was converted into an anime. The disparity of visual nearness from webcomic to screen is just amazing. If you read manga for the art, then read OPM. If you like unappreciated heroism, then read OPM.\nI'll write a more detailed review after the manga finishes.\nLet's hope that doesn't come for a long, long while."},

This is mostly because Saitama often isn't in the battles, and never really \"saves,\" the other people involved in the battle. Saitama is often preoccupied with another fight, or is completely clueless about the battle taking place. This actually sets the stage for all the other fighters to have some nice battles where the power levels are pretty even. Along with the fantastic art, OPM actually functions as good Shonen, even if it sets out to parody\n          \n        it. \nLike I said, it parodies the genre at the same time. Saitama is a joke on the classic Shonen hero; unstoppable, always wins, but described to be \"your everyday hero, the average guy.\" Genos is a joke on the more edgy characters with tragic backstories that look 10x more powerful than the main hero, but in reality they aren't at all. There's another character later, \"Bang,\" who is the stereotypical wise martial arts instructor. Several characters are non allusion jokes, like \"King,\" or \"Pri-Pri-Prisoner.\" Overall, a very funny manga as well, and mixes action and the comedy fantastically. It knows when to be serious, and it knows when to be a complete joke.\nAs a whole, OPM is incredibly enjoyable to read. You'll find several references to other Shonen stuff, and even some jokes about Western stereotypical heroes. The worst part about it is how short the chapters are, chapters that don't come out too often either. In summary, I give it a 9/10.\n        "},
