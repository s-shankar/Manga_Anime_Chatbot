Tenma Tsukamoto, a second year, is on a quest to confess her feelings to the boy she likes. Kenji Harima, a delinquent with a sizable reputation, is in a similar situation, as he cannot properly convey his feelings to the one he loves. Between school, friends, rivalries, and hobbies, these two will find that high school romance is no walk in the park, especially as misunderstandings further complicate their plight. School Rumble is a high-octane romantic comedy full of relatable situations, as Tenma and Kenji both try to win the hearts of those they desire. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=265,  ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Hate watching those anime that drag on for too long with boring storylines?  Then try School Rumble, each episode is totally random, even though it does try to follow a main storyline.  \nAs the story goes on, it becomes more and more hilarious!  I wished my high school was as fun as this.  It portrays as guys being very pathetic and always going after girls, this makes them very funny to watch!  The jokes are very humorous; some is just silly.\nThe animation is very beautiful, although it has more beautiful girls and the boys are all very weird.  The\n          \n        animals drawn are very cute and the main character is such a klutz, her face turns fat all the time.\nThe background sounds are funny, adds comedy to the scene.  The soundtrack is just as good, the music is very soothing.  The voice characters are just funny and the voices are exaggerated very much, which give the impression that the character is very dumb.\nThe characters are very distinct; I get confused sometimes because there are many characters and a lot of names to remember.  I only remember Harima Kenji because the English version of this name is Harry McKenzie.  But his character was the funniest out of all the boys in the class, he is supposed to be a delinquent but then turns all soft and lovey dovey, and the girl he falls for is an average looking slow girl, which makes it all so much funnier because he is dumb as well.\nThis is very enjoyable if you like to watch comedy genres, and don't mind the occasional half naked scenes.  There were many scenes where I was cracking up; this anime has to be the funniest I’ve seen and the most random.\nHighly recommended for boys more than girls because it has a lot of big breasts involved.  It’s just too damn funny!"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=183,  ["text"]="\n                          \n    This review is for the entire School Rumble series.That includes both seasons and all of the OVAs. I don’t believe in dividing up series by seasons and I firmly believe series should be treated as a whole and therefore rated and reviewed, and judged in the same manner.\nSchool Rumble is basically the story of a love triangle. The hyper, slow-witted, dense and yet extremely nice and lovable character Tsukamoto Tenma is in love with her strange and seemingly dull classmate Karasuma Oji and at the same time the misunderstood delinquent Harima Kenji is madly in love with Tsukamoto Tenma to the point that he has\n          \n        been transformed into a new man because of it.\nThe series best fits in the comedy genre and anytime you feel the story is about to take a serious turn, it swings back to its comedic nature faster than you can blink.\nThe characters are probably the best part of this series. While there is really only three or four main characters, on numerous occasions, the series turns its attention to some of the backgrounds characters and lets the viewers get to know them better through some interesting side stories. Tsukamoto Tenma is extremely cute and lovable, Harima Kenji is a brooding delinquent you will love to root for, and Karasuma Oji is the character you will love to hate. The background characters such as Tsukamoto Tenma’s sister, Yakumo (quiet, reserved, and gorgeous girl that almost all men fall in love with at first sight) , Sawachika Eri (the seemingly shallow rich blonde girl sought after by many guys), Suou Mikoto (the athletic and cool tomboy that seems to be good at just about everything), Takano Akira (the quiet, calm, and mysterious girl that seems to know everything) are also very well developed and quite entertaining to watch. There is a character type to suit any viewer’s tastes.\nThe Japanese voice acting is absolutely fantastic and the voices match the characters well without exception. The most notable are the voices Tsukamoto Tenma which is done brilliantly by Koshimizu Ami (The very talented voice actress who does the voices of Kallen in Code Geass - Hangyaku no Lelouch /R2 and Horo in “Spice and Wolf”), and the voice of Harima Kenji which is done by Takahashi Hiroki (the voice of Kikumaru Eiji in Prince of Tennis and Hisoka in Hunter X Hunter).  I can’t comment on the English voice acting due to the fact that I have not watched the dubbed version of the series (…and I have no intention of doing so). \nThe art and animations are not quite as noteworthy as the character design and voice acting. The art is average and the animations are done well most of the time with a few exceptions here and there. That is about all that needs to be said about the art and animations.\nThe story itself and the way it’s developed are both very interesting. However, I did find it quite irritating at times where I felt the story should perhaps take a more serious turn. The show is a comedy and above all else it should be funny and in that area there is definitely no shortcomings. The show is absolutely hilarious. However, while it is a comedy, its subject matter is not, and I would have found it quite refreshing if the writers had not shied away from including some serious elements as a complement to the comedy. Instead, they chose to completely slam on the breaks and put it in reverse whenever there was even the slightest danger of any serious development. The only part where things get even in the least bit serious is in the final two-episode OVA where they attempt to conclude the story.\nAnother area where this show suffered a bit had to do with filler episodes. There are not too many filler episodes and some of the fillers even contribute a little bit to the story. But, fillers are still fillers. While they are not abused to extremes as with some other shows such as Bleach, their presence still adds some annoyance for the viewer.\nATTENTION: The next paragraph talks about the ending. While I will not include any specifics about what happens at the end of the series, I will talk about the style and quality of the ending. If you feel this might spoil things for you, skip over the next paragraph.\nThis is where the show lost the most points from me. While, I did not know the specifics of the ending, I had a very close guess formed by the second or third episode of the first season regarding how the show would conclude. I knew I was in for at least a bit of a letdown at the end simply based on the nature of the show and how it completely shied away from getting even slightly serious. The ending doesn’t really leave you hanging which is good. However, I did not get the ending I wanted and I am fairly certain most people who have watched the series in the past and those who will watch it in the future have felt and will feel the same way I do about this. It will not catch you off guard. You will know it is coming fairly early in the series. But it is still a letdown. Perhaps, an alternate ending episode might have remedied this.\nThe two places this series lost marks from me were the filler episodes and the ending. Without the fillers and with the correct ending this show would have scored full marks.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=63,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    School Rumble is my all time favorite anime series therefore my high score for it and because it actually deserves it.\nStory - Basically, School Rumble has no real storyline besides Tenma going after Karasuma and Harima going after Tenma, thats basically it. But the thing about School Rumble is, even if it barely has a storyline it still appeals to many many people, which is something i believe is unique.\nArt - I adore School Rumble's beautiful design of characters. Even though its a 2004 anime, it still has considerable good graphic maybe even better then some animes in the year 2007. Also one thing i\n          \n        find quite different in the art of school rumble is how KJ ( Kobayashi Jin, creator of school rumble) hides the good-looking appearance of some of the characters such as Harima and Hanai.\nSound - School Rumble has one of the catchiest and most addictive OP any anime ever had 'Guru Guru Mawaru Guru Guru Mawaru....' this song just makes you want to get up dance to the melody. The ED was also very catchy as well, School Rumble's ending is one of the ONLY ones i've watched for all of the episodes. Side from the OP and ED, the voice actor/actress fitted the role very well, from cute and loving Tenma to the complete pervert Imadori, there voice seems to be made for the character. Also Horie Yui is one of my favorite voice actress so i guess that adds up to the score as well.. hehe.\nCharacter - Wide range of entertaining characters all which make you literally laugh out loud. They are all entertaining but they all have very unique personality from the Tsundere Ojou to the Semi-yandere Yakumo. I highly doubt you will hate any of these characters because i certainly didn't!\nEnjoyment - If i could give bonus points for enjoyment of this series, i would. First off, as stated before, this series literally makes you laugh out loud. A series that can actually make someone laugh out loud is something I'd think is freaking hilarious. Hilarious = Enjoyable... therefore School Rumble is really hilarious and enjoyable. (Yes that was lame..)\nOverall - Overall, this series is definitely something you should watch if something is really bothering you and you want to watch something fun and laugh all the pain away. Even if you like really serious stuff like Death Note, you should still try this, you never know you might actually like this genre of anime.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=63,   ["text"]="                          \n    School Rumble is a romantic comedy that you should watch if you don't want to pay attention to any plot details or you just in it for a good laugh. Meaning school rumble is a show that has virtually no main plot and gets nowhere in 26 episodes.\nSTORY:7/10\nNow i did say that there was not plot but that doesn't mean that the show does nothing but corny humor for the entire 26 episodes(even though its all it really needs to do for the genre). They introduce a variety of characters throughout and give them most at least some back story, character development, and even some\n          \n        small story arcs for the larger supporting characters.  The main focus was at first for Harima to confess his love to Tenma and for Tenma to confess her love to Karasuma but later on it changes to just watch as they fail at every attempt and laugh while they do it. The only real problem with the story is by the end nothing really has changed since the beginning, sure Tenma now finds Harima to be a nice guy but their relationship is no different. They don't even know they are interested in each other (that goes for every love relationship in this show)and that is what i find disheartening(not because it takes away from the show but because it keeps the show from being better than average in the story section). The story does everything it needs to do to get the job done but not much more to surpass and be a truly great anime.\nCHARACTERS:9/10\nIf you can look past how good the comedy is in this show you will realize how strong the character cast is. First off Harima was one of the funniest and unique characters i have seen(best character in the show), honestly put him in the spot light and its guaranteed a good laugh. But all the characters as a whole is what truly makes this show special. Let me explain, in most high school shows they focus on maybe five characters and they are in a tight nit group with very similar interests. School Rumble on the other hand exceeds the amount of characters that  you would expect and they are all from completely different stereotypical social cliches(There is the smart kids, the delinquent, the Marshall arts student, the big boobed bimbo, the dumb kid, the photographer, the pervert, the rich girl, the popular kid, the kid sister, and so many more) that are all pretty well defined, and they ARE ALL CONNECTED. For example  how often do you see a show were the main character knows the school nurse on a personal basis. Its like this with almost every character interaction. the only people i found in the show that were not explained were a few people Harima worked for. I also believe that all the different character cliches clashing with one another is one of many elements that makes this anime so funny. They are also able to make all of the characters likable while making them all so different which is something to be proud of(this fact alone is why this show sticks out as one of the better anime out there).\nART/ANIMATION:9/10\nThe animation in this show was nothing to special at most times but it had its moments(Ex.bike chase in beginning of show,\"Matrix\" scene, and the Alien ship).\nWhat was the best part in this department was the art specifically the facial expressions on Harima and Tenma when they reacts to specific moments throughout the show. They are able create most the most funny moments in this show using their facial expressions and lets be honest if this show makes you laugh it has served its purpose.\nSOUND:8/10 \nThe opening and ending songs for this show were both catchy and were good fits for the show itself. the atmospheric and suspenseful music were both pretty good as well but nothing in this section was supremely good in my opinion.\nPROS:\n-All characters are likable\n-Most characters are connected and are from different school life cliches providing great dynamic moments\n-art was effective in amplifying comedy and more\n\nCONS:\n-No real results, most things we know in the beginning are the same in the end\n-Show thrives off a specific humor so its not enjoyable for all audiences\n-Harimas unbelievable fails at love confession get annoying after a while\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL:8/10\nMy overall enjoyment for this show thrived off of the comedy itself and seeing all the different character personalities. The only things about this show that were not great was the lack of a strong story arc and there was no real change from the beginning of the show to the end.\nThis is a really Unique Romantic comedy that is TV-PG so all demographics can see it and has no fan service so its great for men and women to watch. But when it comes down to it the only thing this show actually needs to do is make you laugh and it does more than that. If this is your type of humor and you are looking for a show that you can just sit back and relax while watching than this is the show for you.\nThank you for anyone who took the time to read my review, and have a great day!!"},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=30,   ["text"]="                          \n    I have loved OURAN HOST CLUB and upon looking for another High School anime, I stumbled upon School Rumble. Well, at first look, it really did look like a nice enjoyable anime...\n... but I was dead wrong. I'm sorry but it was really dreadful, and the fact that there was really no particular character development at the least. The story was in shambles. Yes, it did follow this sort of story outline, but did anybody notice that the main story-- whatever happened to Karasuma-kun in the middle of the story? he seemed totally forgotten..what the heck? After all those what happened, the conclusion was very\n          \n        weak and really didn't offer much. I checked out the 2nd season, and it was the same thing.\nThis anime really has the potential to be a good one. It should have been a good given such a nice material to work on.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=25,   ["text"]="                          \n    This series makes me wonder if they've cloystered off this small region of Japan where they put all the nation's socially inept kids, kind of like what Britain did with Australia except instead of shipping out monstrous deviants like Jack the Ripper, the Japanese would use their packing peanuts on annoyances like that kid you'd invite to your birthday party only because your mom made you. Actually, that's not entirely true. Part of what makes this series work so well is that the characters, for as thick as they are, are also incredibly likable. The other part is just how insanely hilarious this show is,\n          \n        in a \"giggle at the sociably retarded\" kind of way. You know, the kind of people that could only win at a game of hide-and-seek because no one actually wanted to go looking for them... \nOkay, I'll drop it, making those jokes was getting to be like rubbing a balloon on the back of a kitten, it's cruel and easy and you shouldn't do it, but it's just so much fun! That's not to say that the show itself is stupid. I thought that at first, but the further I got into it, the more I realized how brilliant it was.\nLet me put it this way: this is a story where everyone is madly in love with precisely the wrong person. It starts out simple and honestly, really stupid, but as the number of characters reaches astronomical levels, and all those distinctly dysfunctional characters get intertwined in this ginormous cluster of unspoken infatuation, it gets more and more hilarious and very clever if only for the way the writers kept track of everyone’s crushes and what misunderstandings they had about all the other characters’ crushes and mashed them all together to keep bringing crazy situations where everyone’s horribly mistaken about everything to the whole nutty table. \nNo matter how close they come to a confession, all our favorite knuckleheads will inevitably be crushed and have to start at square one with the clusterfruck only tightened further. This bizarre and torturous treatment of the characters would only be permissible if the show was really funny and crazy. In case it wasn’t obvious by now…it’s hilarious, and it’s INSANE.\nI mean, throughout the ups and downs of the series, and it’s almost all downs as the entire cast of the show was apparently skipped when God was handing out good timing, it retains a “barely” kind of believability. The characters are genuinely lovable, if not broader than a pair of Siamese twins in Weight Watchers, but this is nothing like your typical romance comedy. The series is more like a Bugs Bunny cartoon than anything else, except that it’s set in high school. This makes it hard to accept any kind of drama, so thankfully, the series doesn’t try for any. Just when you think it’s getting sentimental on you, it’s probably setting you up for another gag. \nThat’s not to say it doesn’t attempt drama sometimes, but usually this is a wasted effort, and the times it succeeds are usually black comedy in disguise more than actual drama. It is sporadically tender in an “Aw, look at the idiots,” kind of way, but yeah, sporadically. Most of the time, it’s just plain goofy. But you know, thank GOODNESS for that. It’s at its best when it’s unabashedly STUPID, and if you enjoy screwy as much as I do, this isn’t just your cup of tea, it’s the entire teapot.\nOn the technical side of things, the animation and music do their job but are nothing unique, cute girls, cute guys, and lots of chibification, and plinking background tones like every other slice-of-life comedy, with the exception of the hysterically upbeat opener and closer that I could never bear to skip even into the umpteenth episode. \nBoth audio tracks, sub and dub, are appropriately wacky with just a pinch of “normal” to hold your interest in the extremely caffeinated characters. I also have to applaud the dub for handling the humor well, as a lot of jokes don’t translate directly and creative colloquialisms by the writers make it just as funny in English as it stands in Japanese. Harima’s actor in particular seems to have “grizzled punching bag” running in his veins and Tenma is equal parts cuddly and obnoxious, which is also perfect casting for you.\nAll in all, a great comedy series, over-the-top and unendingly silly, but it might be just a little TOO silly for some people, and you have to really love all the incredibly blockheaded characters to like the show. \n*THIS IS A PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF MY VIDEO REVIEW THAT CAN BE SEEN HERE:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdAYycAe55Q\nThanks for reading!\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=25,   ["text"]="                          \n    This show is awesome. After a long day at school,college, work etc this is the anime to watch. No heavy mood in there. Although I must say the manga is better than the anime. I adored the story, a not so typical high school story. The only downside to the story was the final episode. It was a bit confusing considering they were jumping back and forth between events. Thankfully the previous episodes made up for it. \nThe art is wonderful. In anime you often see that some aspects of the images are astonishing whereas some other aspects look horrible (for example the lips). None\n          \n        of this is present in School Rumble, the art is great and fits the mood of the anime perfectly.\nIt took a while to get used to the opening theme but overall the music was quite good. The right songs were played at the right time and it was good to hear the actual characters sing, for a bit.\nI love the characters in School Rumble, the only characters I found quite a bit annoying were at times Yakumo, and more often than not, Tenma. Harima was brilliant, he is one of the funniest characters in anime history no doubt. I found the pace at which new characters were introduced fine, not too many characters were introduced at once, which is always a good thing. \nOverall I thoroughly enjoyed this anime with the exception of the final episode which is why the overall grade for it is an 8 instead of a 9 or 10. After all final episodes are supposed to blow you away and this one did not do that. I hope the second season will be as good as this one though ^_^ \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=22,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Story: 9\nOn first appearance, School Rumble doesn't have a story, but this slice of life actually does and it is; 'everyone is in love with the wrong person and they are all a raving pack of morons.'  There you go, that is the plot.  This show is simply one gag after another with drama that's really just getting you ready for another gag.  Many story elements make no sense, so don't even try.  The purpose of the show is fun, nothing more.  Now how did a slice of life, with such a simple premise, and a just-for-fun attitude get a\n          \n        9?  Because it works so well!  The timing of the jokes are so near perfection and the utter randomness, and I laughed every episode.  Also The ending makes just so much sense and all I can say about that is just wow.\nThe series also feels longer than it really is because each episode has three storylines, each seem like episodes unto themselves.\nArt: 7\nWell, it’s lacking.  Character designs are good, but overall animation not that great.  Backgrounds are typically well drawn but many scenes are just speed lines, especially the fight scenes, yes I did just say fight scenes, plural.\nSound: 8 (dub)\nThe intro and ending are wonderful, and incredibly addicting.  I never skipped the opening, it was just so good.  The dub voice acting was hilarious and was oddly even able to convey puns from the Japanese, though perhaps with different words.  Harima was hilarious with such precious lines and his voice actor, Brandon Potter, was perfect.  Eric Vale who played Karasima was also well cast, having played Yuki Sohma in Fruits Basket using his smooth quiet voice.  Background music was, forgettable, and unfortunately there was next to no environment sounds.  But I suppose those might distract from the endless comedy.  One of the best dubs I’ve heard.\nCharacter: 9\nOne word describes most of the characters; moron.  They are all morons, but such incredibly likeable morons that you just, well, like them.  Much of the comedy is simply watching these characters mess up in their everyday lives and in their many attempts to confess their undying love.  It would be very difficult to pick a favourite from this cast of character they are all just so great.\nOverall: 9\nThe funniest comedy I’ve ever seen (even funnier than Ouran, my 2nd favourite show).  The comedy is never crude and just slightly inappropriate, though oddly anything bad is avoided from being said.  Just overall good fun.\nParental Caution:\nRated PG-13\n-There's a pool episode and a beach episode, (episodes 11 and 12) that seems to be a staple for slice of life animes.\n-In one of said episodes you see Harima's backside... my eyes died.\n-Swearing, and Harima uses the middle finger, but it's \"censored\"\n-Comical violence\n-There's not anything explicit, but so many scenes make possible innuendos and questionable situations, but no fear they are simply setting you up for a gag.\n        "},

Just an episodic series that does build up the character's relationships throughout, but the show is purely comedy. What makes it better is that it doesn't\n          \n        use \"ecchi\" in order to create the comedy.\nStory: School Rumble does not have any real plot, it just skips around the completely unrealistic comedy life of highschool kids and... a tough delinquent? The tough badass delinquent, Harima Kenji is madly in love with Tsukamoto Tenma, a clueless and innocent girl who looks and acts like a complete idiot. And.. then there's the whole load of side characters who are all mixed in like a love octagon? Or maybe even bigger relationship. Basically, the guys in the story are all somewhat perverts who are all in love with a specific girl, and they try to impress/win the hearts of the girls by doing the funniest things I've seen in a show. Ah yes, this show is the definition of anime rom-com because it's hilariously unrealistic. How I wish my school days were something alone the lines of what happens in this show... Nonetheless it was a great enjoyable watch.\nArt: Normally, I don't know how to grade the art in a rom-com show much, but in School Rumble's case, I'm giving it a 10/10 because of how they drew facial expressions and actions of each character. The portrayal of each character was hilarious, I might have teared up many times from laughter! Beautiful, diverse females, and pretty damn funny males. Perfect art. \nSound: GURUGURU MAWARU GURUGURU MAWARU. That opening song really makes me head spin around (heh...), because of how addicting it is! Every time I watched an episode of School Rumble, I looked forward to watching the opening and spinning my head around humming the tune in my head. The side soundtracks were really funny in their own way, and added to the entire comedy of the show. Voices matched each of the character's ... character. Overall the sound was decent, but far from great since there really was no \"good\" music - piano like other slice of life shows such as Ano Hana.\nCharacter: So many characters and not a single one that you dislike. All the main character females, like 6 with like 10 side always popping up, were hilarious. And the main character males, like 1 (Kenji Harima, the delinquent is overall main character, and he is one of if not the funniest character in all anime!) alongside like 6 side male characters were soooooooooooooo funny. I loved all the characters, always cheered their love relationship on, except for Tenma and Harima because I wanted Harima to be be with Eri Sawachika, they were perfect for eachother! ♥ Tenma was annoying, but oh well, her sister makes up for her.\nEnjoyment: I loved this anime so much purely because of how funny and enjoyable it was. All school-comedies should follow the structure of School Rumble. Definitely a must-watch comedy for everyone, all ages. If you're feeling bored and lonely, then go to Youtube and watch the entire series! It has another season too, and although the ending of the anime was \"meh\", the overall series was great, despite having no plot. Solely an enjoyable show.\n        "},

I had to stop watching early on into season 2, I was really trying to make myself like this show but I couldn't.

This is literally Blueballs the Anime. There was so much potential for a good ending yet they just keep letting this game of cat and mouse go on. Misunderstanding after misunderstanding. Was honestly a pain to sit through.\nStory was pretty episodic but they still managed to have some story progress little by little. Isn't really that impressive either.\nArt was normal for that year. Nothing fancy.\nSound could have been better. They re-use the soundtrack a lot but you won't notice it since it's pretty decent and\n          \n        the voice actors aren't a pain to listen to.\nCharacter development was almost nonexistent except for a few people like, Harima and Sawachika who become more realistic in their mindsets towards unrequited love.  Everyone else pretty much remains the same and doesn't change.\nEnjoyment? I honestly laughed quite a lot during some episodes, but I came here for romance AND comedy like the genre tags said. I don't enjoy going to an anime in hopes of romance just to get a gag anime the blueballs you for 26 episodes, not delivering any satisfaction.\nSeriously, avoid this anime unless you're just looking for a school based gag anime with unrequited love. Even the freaking minor characters got more love action than the main character. That's how bad this is. Surprised it took most reviewers here till the third season to finally realize that.\n        "},

Unfortunately, School Rumble is NOT a show about a school that rumbles. Thankfully, it's a damn good romantic comedy that's actually funny! Don't let the word \"romantic\" fool you into thinking that it'll be anything like Clannad or Chu2 either. There's no annoying melodrama to be found anywhere, no teenage angst to put a damper on your good mood, or any of that bullshit. There's also no overarching story that forces you to sit through every episode either. This is the kind of show that you\n          \n        can sit down and enjoy with your friends whilst laughing your asses off and eating some pizza (even if they're not into anime), and that's the kind of show I just love to watch!\nIn terms of story, School Rumble is the anime equivalent of a late-90s Cartoon Network show like Dexter's Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, Ed, Edd n Eddy, or The Powerpuff Girls: there's no overarching plot, it's mostly episodic, and nothing of significance happens by the time the season's over. Whereas most romantic comedies to come out in recent years focus more on the romance, School Rumble just tries to make you laugh and if my results are anything to go by, I'm sure you'll get more than just a quiet chuckle every now and then. Then again, comedy is purely subjective and I know damn well there some popular comedies that failed to make me laugh even once (cough cough The Big Bang Theory cough cough) but let's not open up that can of worms right now.\nKeeping in line with that late-90s Cartoon Network comedy feel, every episode of School Rumble is told in three ~7-minute long segments that have next-to-nothing to do with each other. Each segment tackles a simple dilemma that one (or both) of our airheads in love will have to put up with like Harima trying to sit next to Tenma during the school field trip or Tenma trying to sketch Kurasama during art class. I can safely say that this approach worked incredibly well to School Rumble's favour. The concept of each segment is incredibly simple, which makes room for a lot of jokes to be told and the segment's just short enough to prevent that concept from getting stale and repetitive. Another upside to this is the fact that you don't have to sit through the entire episode either. I mean, I like to watch segments from episodes of School Rumble on my phone when I'm on the bus to class and by the time the segment's over, the bus is already at the college.\nReally, the only complaint I have with the show is that I can't really sit down and watch more than 1-2 whole episodes at a time but that's basically the way I am with comedy shows in general. Whilst I have no problem with comedy, I enjoy shows that have much more to offer than the comedy alone. If I was given the choice to watch an episode of GTO or an episode of School Rumble, I'd probably go with the former since GTO has a lot more to it than just the comedy. But then again, everyone's different so maybe you might be the kind of person who can just sit down and marathon 12 episodes in one sitting.\nIf you're expecting multi-faceted individuals that parallel the kind of questionable morality that real humans tend to have, look elsewhere. School Rumble's characters aren't compelling individuals in the slightest, nor do they undergo any significant change throughout the course of the series. You know what? That's okay! I mean, Dexter's Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, and The Powerpuff Girls had static characters and yet people love the everliving Christ out of those shows. This doesn't mean that the characters in School Rumble are terrible. In fact, they're far from it. Tenma and Harima are quite possibly some of the most endearing and hilarious airheads in all of comedy anime. If School Rumble ever took itself a little more seriously, you'd bet your sweet ass I'd be shipping the hell out of those two (oh fuck it, I still do!). All of the supporting characters play off of Tenma and Harima exceptionally well too. I never get tired of Tenma's friends and their reactions to her latest scheme to end up with Kurasama. Speaking of Kurasama... there isn't much I really can say about him except he reminds me of Octavius Rex from that episode of Spongebob where Spongebob takes Pearl to prom.\nThere isn't a lot I can really say about School Rumble beyond the fact that it's funny. I mean, the jokes are well-timed and they actually work, the English dub is some of Funimation's best work to date (especially given that we have amazing voice actors like Her Highness Lucy Christian as Tenma and Brandon Potter as Harima), but that's basically it. Sure, I can go on and talk about the artwork, the animation, and the soundtrack but I'm pretty sure most people don't go into a comedy show for the pinnacle of audio-visual quality. \nOverall, I give School Rumble an 8/10. It's not the epitome of comedy gold like Gintama apparently is, but it's still pretty damn funny! If you're in the mood for a comedy show that you can watch with your friends and have a damn good time watching it, this show fits the bill and then some. I mean, you don't even need to know anything about Japanese culture to even understand the jokes in the first place and there isn't much in the way of fan service or juvenile humour at that. This is something you can actually watch with your family provided that they're willing to give it a shot. Unless you have some sort of long-standing visceral hatred of romantic comedies (or comedies in general), there's no reason why you shouldn't give this show a chance. Anyway, that's it for this review. Feedback is always welcome and with that, I'm out. Peace :)\n***\nSince I haven't done any alternate recommendations in a while, here are a few shows you should check out if you're in the mood for something like School Rumble:\n- Ouran HSHC (the English dub is some really hilarious stuff)\n- Azumanga Daioh (the quintessential slice-of-life comedy)\n- Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu (another hilarious slice-of-life comedy with Luci Christian as the leading lady)\n- Great Teacher Onizuka (much more crass and vulgar than School Rumble, but every bit as hilarious. Plenty of sweet and heartwarming moments to go around and hey, it actually has character development! Steve Blum was even cast as Onizuka, what's not to like?!)\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="                          \n    “To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others.”\n-Tony Robbins\nMiscommunication happens often in our everyday lives. When we miscommunicate with each other there are several outcomes that can happen. People may laugh, they may cry, or they may become angry and unhappy. Now what do you get when those miscommunications mixed with high school crushes? Well you end up with the insanity that is School Rumble. This comedy anime is one built around the two main characters, Harima and Tenma, as they attempt to\n          \n        confess to the ones that they love. Unfortunately, the entire cast, including themselves, are as dense as stone.\nStory\nNow the story of School Rumble is interesting in how it’s told. It’s an episodic comedy in the sense of Seitokai Yakuindomo, but also has an overarching story of a love triangle mixed in with subplots galore. Each episode has three scenarios which are conjoined at times in a continuous story, yet at the same time it feels like several different comedy skits. At the beginning, the show is all over the place with only one setting in mind, but quickly progresses to an intertwined story that builds on each part. We see Harima's journey to find himself along with trying to win the love of Tenma, while Tenma tries to the win the love of Karasuma, while Karasuma...is just Karasuma. That's the basics of the main story in a nutshell. Sadly, the ending leaves a lot to be desired, and we hope the producers were planning on a second season when they made it. The show left off on one of the best episodes of the series with a cliff-hanger that ultimately could change the story's main purpose completely... But rather than produce a satisfactory conclusion, the episode zooms out giving a sales pitch for another season. This ending left us, as viewers, unsatisfied and slightly perturbed.\nCharacters\nThe characters, with the exception of a few, were quite interesting. Harima evolves as a character through all of his crazy antics, yet at the same time, he manages to retain his usual thick-headedness. He grows from the people he interacts with and shows himself to not be a delinquent, but rather who treats those he values with care. Characters like this are common and well-developed throughout the story. Though in every great cast there will always be a few characters that feel like they don’t fit for people.  Tenma and Karasuma are the two we agreed upon as those outliers for School Rumble. Tenma is thick-headed to the point where it isn't funny anymore. Karasuma, though, is the main offender. His character was made to be a bland stereotype, however, the producers went too far, or rather, left too much lacking. He was, to put it mildly, just a weird focus for Tenma’s affection. The writers even realized this and stated that they will have to bring him back at some point since they've had him in the background him for too long. Despite these flaws with two characters, they do go well with the overall group dynamic, and help to produce a few extremely funny scenes at times. \nAnimation\nSchool Rumble had a generic animation, with rough lines at times. However, all the while the anime never takes itself too seriously, which does show When they want to show an important or touching scene, everything gets brighter and the scene seems to have more work put into the drawings of the background. This animation style branches out into other types like a comedy does at times—going from realistic, to simple, to rough lines, to smooth lines. With these constantly changes, it will keep your attention fixed on the show.\nMusic\nAll in all, excluding the music during important scenes and opening and ending, there is nothing memorable about the background music. The more sappy music has an enjoyable soft pop feel to it that is emotional yet uplifting at the same time. This results in not a somber atmosphere, but allows the listener to be happy with a tear in their eye. The opening is a quite catchy song, and easily brings you into the anime as a whole. The opening allows you to see both the serious and comedic nature behind the show. The ending is merely fan service with a surprisingly realistic song. If you pay attention to the lyrics, it talks about what happens throughout the entire show, \"Boys will not understand girls.\" which is how an ending should tie in.\nEnjoyment\nThe comedy was fun and did a lot to give to the overall impression of the anime. The number of Japanese jokes was large, which was both simplistic and funny ranging from cultural to stereotyping; as well as school humour and various religious references. We enjoyed it thoroughly as we followed this tale of growth for a young man. \nSchool Rumble was an enjoyable romp of miscommunication. It was able to entrance you through the characters crazy antics coupled with their relationships with one another and their struggles with said relationships. This cast didn’t need the most well detailed story to bring themselves to life. Despite being well planned with a basic overarching story, we felt that it needed more impact in order to bring out the show’s full potential. The comedy was refreshing and executed, with very little characters giving hiccups in execution along the way. The songs are quite catchy as well, but are certainly nothing remarkable. School Rumble is an exceptional comedy, but if the producers had made some tweaks here and there, it could have been one of the best comedies currently made. \nValue\n“It takes time to understand people.” And in this show, the cast all seem to have a pre-conceived notions of the ones they love. This anime shows the negative side of crushes—for even if you are attracted to someone, you should never assume you know them entirely. As this series shows, making that mistake will lead to pain in the future, which is a message that everyone can relate to. \nA VIA rifle review written by:\nSchizoidmouse\nCo-reviewer:\nImabooterfly\nScores\nStory: 8.3, 9 = 8.6\nCharacters: 9.3, 9 = 9.1\nAnimation: 8.2, 7 = 7.6\nMusic: 8.6, 8 = 8.3\nEnjoyment: 9.3, 9 = 9.1\nOverall: 8.7, 8.4 = 8.5"},

I will NOT include the sequel OVAs in this review.\nSo. School. All of us are either in school or went through it at some point, and if you went through school, chances are that you have both fond and bitter memories of your time there, ranging from your unrequited crush dating the local gangster leader to your dog actually eating your homework and no one believing it to you accidentally ending up on\n          \n        the bus travelling to the opposite end of the country and no one noticing because your existence is that meaningless to you freeing animals from the local zoo and terrorizing children in a playground...\nWait, what do you mean that none of that happened? You mean...all of that was a lie? \nBlasphemy!\nBut you know all the absurdity and stupidity that you go through as a high-schooler? All the dumb moments and drama that is so bloody ridiculous in retrospect, yet you can't help and look back and laugh, even be a bit nostalgic?\nThat, ladies and gentlemen, is School Rumble. Imagine every absurd situation in high school blown out of proportion over a thousand times over, and you get the comedy in this show.\nI'll be very blunt; if you're not fond of that kind of humor, you might as well stop reading this review and head elsewhere. School Rumble's appeal is oddly specific, and if you don't match that appeal, then this show is not for you. At all.\nIf what I said so far sounds like your cup of tea, read on.\nSchool Rumble's basic premise is that your ditzy airhead Tenma likes Mr. What's-his-personality, and Harima, the local delinquent, likes Tenma. \nThis premise is, for the most part, only followed superficially; what instead happens is random comedic skits (and do take my word on it, they're random to hell and back) about Tenma and Harima trying to get their respective crushes to notice their feelings. It backfires. Spectacularly. \nThe show largely consists of two general scenes; either some kind of skit following (but not necessarily, especially in season 2) Tenma or Harima. The other kind of general scene tends to be interactions between the various characters, though those tend to be filled to the brim with comedy. These scenes are considerably more quiet and are more about how the characters feel about various things, usually graduating or their feelings about various characters. They're incredibly interesting and offer different perspectives about the characters, making this work unbelievably well as a character-driven show as well.\nSpeaking of the characters, I love all of them. All of them receive some degree of development and change over the course of the show (and the manga if you continue that after season 2), all of them are absolutely hilarious and all of them work off one another really well. It's not every day that I walk out of a show with absolutely no complaints about any of the characters and feeling like I don't hate any of them, but School Rumble pulls this off.\nArtwork is simple enough but varied and changes depending on what comedic skit is taking place; it's effective, it works with the comedy and ultimately that's all what really matters. Animation quality looks dated but doesn't get in the way of the comedy or character drama, and that's perfectly fine.\nThe voice-acting sounds great in both versions, though I have a personal bias towards the English dub; the dialogue is funnier and the comedic timing feels better. The soundtrack is generally solid though can feel slightly repetitive; the opening and ending songs are exceptionally catchy and fit the mood of the show, with the openings being more upbeat and the ending songs being more bittersweet.\nI love this show to hell and back and I enjoyed every last second of it, and if what I'm saying sounds rad then do give it a shot as well. It's not for everyone and the fact that you have to read the manga to get to the conclusion after the second season undeniably is a barrier to some, but if you can look past that you're in for one hell of a ride.\nThanks a bunch for reading, any and all feedback would be appreciated.

I hadn't heard much about it previously, and at the time I was looking for something \"different\" to watch. What I found... was the ultimate Rom-Com. Other than one little Achilles Heel, this series could very well be one of the best, and also one of the most underrated, in all anime.\nSTORY: 10/10\nHere is a quick synopsis of the main story-line: it all centers around three students at high school. There is Tenma Tsukamoto, Karasuma Ooji, and Kenji Harima. Tenma has fallen in love with Karasuma, Kenji has fallen in love with Tenma,\n          \n        and Karasuma... is just kind of existing. That's the whole plot, short version. Obviously, \"long version\" wouldn't be much longer. So how can a show with a plot that is shallower than a kiddie pool get a 10/10 rating? Simple: it doesn't NEED a complex plot. What this show does an EXCELLENT job of doing is recognizing its identity. It knows it's a comedy. It knows it's supposed to be a simple, relaxed, laid-back show meant primarily for laughs. Therefore it doesn't really take itself seriously by overworking itself on a complicated plot but it DOES deliver the best comedy I've ever seen in an anime! Also don't think this show is ONLY laughs. School Rumble will occasionally throw you a curve ball with a serious moment every once in a while. It's just uncommon enough that you will most likely be unprepared for it when it comes for a majority of the series. Not that it is a bad thing. It's a welcome change-of-pace. Just another thing School Rumble does right.\nART: 10/10\nEverything was on point here as well, every character looked magnificent. They all had their own unique look, only time there was similarities in how two characters looked was if they were related. That kind of variety I thought really brought a lot to School Rumble. I loved how whenever we were in a Kenji manga scene or a Tenma dream sequence, they kept the animation the same (or at least very similar) so as to keep the viewers as unaware as possible. A big thing to me in anime is opening/closing credit sequences. Are they able to please my eyes and ears? Or do I quickly become bored and desperately wait for it to end? In this case, when it comes to the visual aspect of both credits sequences, I was very happy with them. Very pleasing to the eyes and they suited the anime very well as well. School Rumble's art department didn't really miss a detail. From opening credits to Tenma's cute little pigtails getting active when she gets excited to closing credits, they made sure to cover every tiny little thing.\nSOUND: 8/10\nThis is probably School Rumble's one weakness. The sound itself during the show is, of course, solid. You don't expect perfect sound out of a comedy show but all things considered the sounds they did end up delivering ended up pretty dang solid and realistic, especially for what you would expect. Kenji's motorcycle made me feel like I was riding a Harley, for example. Other sound effects I think were purposely exaggerated. Nothing wrong with that in a comedy. The sound effects were solid, and held their weight, just like the rest of the show, but it's about time I tackle the REAL one weakness of this entire show- the music. Now first understand, when I say \"weakness\", I use that term lightly. The music in School Rumble isn't really all that bad. It's just the only thing with flaws. Anyways... first, the music in the opening credits: this is evidence to how lightly I use the term \"weakness\". The opening credits music is SUPERB. It's catchy, upbeat, has a REALLY positive vibe, it just fits this anime PERFECTLY!!! As for the closing credits music... it's a different story. The music isn't BAD, it just... doesn't fit School Rumble. It seemed a little quieter, I didn't really get the point as much, and the writing seemed lazy. You don't end ANY song with 15+ seconds of \"lalalalala\". As for music during the show, I saved this for last for a reason. I usually have a hard time noticing the music during the show because I'm so plugged into the show. I did catch some bits and pieces during School Rumble. The pieces I caught seemed pretty well done but not perfect; with a little more practice it could've been better. I implore you to not ask for further details.\nCHARACTER: 10/10\nThis is probably where School Rumble shines brightest. School Rumble does a BRILLIANT job of bringing in COUNTLESS meaningful characters into the story. Because there is little to no story, School Rumble has the flexibility to do so. So what starts off as Tenma, Karasuma, and Harima in the first episode slowly becomes this complex network of characters that all have different personalities, interests, crushes, enemies... you get the idea. Personally, my favorite character was Harima. He was trying to confess to Tenma the entire series and it always led to hilariously sticky results. Whenever Harima tried to do something to better his relationship with Tenma (if not confessing) it always somehow made things worse. The way he could screw up the simplest of things is comedy gold. He may be my favorite, but every character on the screen looks amazing, sounds amazing, is unique, is truly hilarious... the only character I MIGHT have a complaint about is Karasuma. It's not really a complaint though... he's just weird.\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\nI was laughing my butt off practically from the moment I started watching this series. I never really stopped except for the rare serious moments and when the series ended. There were moments when I needed to pause the show because I was laughing so hard and I just couldn't stop and I didn't want to miss anything. There is an extremely high likelihood that this will be the first anime that I will watch for a second time. I could go on, but at this point, I don't think I need to...\nOVERALL: 10/10\nOther than a couple minor errors in the Sound category, I consider School Rumble to be literally flawless. The plot is thin but not much plot is needed. It's replaced with the best comedy I have ever seen. From beginning to end it was very much a visual marvel. This is the best AND deepest cast of characters I have ever seen in an anime. And I can truthfully say... I've never had more fun watching a TV show than I did watching School Rumble. As I said before, this will probably be the first anime I ever re-watch, and I desperately urge you to watch it as well. \n        "},

I tried to watch it a year or two ago, but had to drop it as it didn't hold my interest. I was, however, more into the action side of things back then, so I do plan on giving it another go. \nIt started off strong, and I was a fan, but I soon, as I stated in the paragraph above, lost interest. It was a very sweet anime, and fun for some, but if you're not into this genre, then I would suggest you think twice before starting this. \nOnce I\n          \n         watch the show again, I will update my review to my new opinions, but for now this will have to do. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    School Rumble very well may be the finest anime comedy ever produced. The brilliance of mangaka Jin Kobayashi isn't in the plot or themes of this story, but instead in the incredible strength of the ensemble cast of characters. School Rumble is one of the few animes that features not just an array of beautiful young girls, but also a supporting cast of male characters, all of whom are incredibly likable and funny. \nThe situations and set-ups border on rehashing tired old rom-com tropes, but even if we know that the entire series is going to center around a series of unfortunate mistakes and misunderstandings,\n          \n        you'll stick around for the often surreal humor and hilarious dialogue. It just goes to show that in the hands of a good creator, even tired old plot lines can become fresh and entertaining when handled with the appropriate amount of care and enthusiasm. \nAnother strength of this anime is that while the central character is Harima, the cast do not revolve around him. Indeed, you could be forgiven for thinking that School Rumble is a \"harem\" style anime due to the number of attractive girls featured prominently in it, but in fact it's best described as a \"love trainwreck\" and an entertaining one to watch. There are many couples that get together, or chase after each other, or break up and even a few that you're certain are perfect for each other (if only they could see it) and watching these side stories develop is incredibly engaging. This is, frankly, an ensemble cast done well - a rare thing in a relatively modern anime.\nFinally, the music for this entire series (both seasons and the OVA) is incredible. This season features the lovely and talented Yui Horie (Eri Sawachika) singing the catchy ska-style theme song, \"SCRAMBLE\" as well as gravure idol Yuko Ogura singing \"Onna no Ko Otoko no Ko\", which was a hit outside of Japan. If you don't find yourself accidentally humming these songs to yourself years after you've watched this anime, then there's probably something wrong with you!\n        "},

The main story  basicly revolves around kenji harima (one of the main charecters) and his \"love\" for a girl at school named tenma. He is always getting annoyed(not at her) when she go's all crazy over her major crush karasima (which just happens to be one of the wierdest guys in school.) I highly recommend this anime and really wish they could have made a season 3 (they couldnt because the manga ended.) I think i became sorta attached to it because it was one\n          \n        of the first animes i fineshed. One of the things i didnt like was the fact that the second season made me miss the first one. overall id give this anime a 9.0 and i hope you will enjoy watching it as much as i did.

This is by far the funniest anime I&rsquo;ve ever seen but to be fair I will point out the good and the bad in this anime.\nStory\nIf you are\n          \n        looking for a very sweet, slow and dramatic anime look else where because School rumble takes viewers for one hilarious ride, but the amazing thing is that even though it is primarily a comedy anime, its has heart wrenching moments of drama and romance. Not the kind you will see on soap operas, but the sweet yet sour kind. It has a tragic romance twist to it which keeps fans tuned in for more School Rumble. School Rumble is a Comedy first romance second anime about a 17 year old clumsy girl named Tenma who looks to win the heart of her high school crush Karusuma who happens to be the most boring character ever created. Harima Kenji(some call him the real main character) is the high school delinquent, he actually happens to be my favorite anime character of all time, a very rough and dumb guy yet with a big heart. Harima is in love to with&hellip;. Tenma, you can see where this show is going as it starts with a long triangle immediately. Now both Harima and Tenma are trying to win the hearts of their respective crushes but fail miserably every time in the most hilarious way. What really drew me into this show were its side characters fine development, Sawachika Eri friend of Tenma and Tsukamoto Yakumo the sister of Tenma somehow begin to have feelings for the male lead Harima Kenji. That&rsquo;s when the story gets interesting. Multiple love stories unfolding in the funniest way, with the most random twists and jaw dropping moments. \nCharacters\nWhat can I say about the characters in this show, they are by far in my opinion the most well thought out and detailed characters I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Not just the main characters, but even the side characters have deeper story lines and real life like problems in conveying their feelings to the one they like. Everyone in real life has experienced the inability to confess to the one they love, and school rumble takes that into the anime world and this show takes a slice of life and mixes in comedy to keep itself appealing. My favorite characters Harima, Eri and Yakumo who are all very unique and personalities I haven&rsquo;t seen in other animes. Other side characters like Hanai, Mikoto and Akira are even appealing and interesting. You will certainly fall in love with at least several of these characters before this anime ends. \nThe Bad\nThe bad part would be the lack of speed in developing the story line but that was inevitable in a comedy oriented anime, where entertainment comes before storyline. So some viewers will feel like the story isn&rsquo;t going anywhere I would argue that this is a good thing though, the show builds up the story through all the funny situations to create a feeling amongst fans for a certain outcome calling for a climactic conclusion.\nOverall\nSchool Rumble took me on one of the most enjoyable rides I&rsquo;ve experienced. The re-watch value is very high since there is mountains of comedy in each episode and it just doesn&rsquo;t get old. The situations are funny and even intensely dramatic at times. \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    While watching this series, my TV screen seemed to have a hand that slapped my face every 10 minutes I spent watching School Rumble. Why? Well it all starts (and ends) with the story.\nStory: The story of School Rumble, when you look at the bare bones of it, is classic and to some might seem cliché. But as with shows like Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai and Ouran High School Host Club, the writers know this and have so much fun with it that it seems to \"slap you in the face\" with it's ridiculous twists and turns. The story should be described as a\n          \n        fun roller coaster of a story. Even though the show seemed to repeat the same situations a lot, there was enough hilarious jokes and small differences between the situations that School Rumble never got boring until the last episode of the first season were it did get...how should I say...kind of \"get it over with already\" if that makes sense. Even though the story was classic, it saves itself with a good sense of humor and a fun script.\nCharacters: The characters in  School Rumble are far above average. Even though they may be \"one-note\" if you look at them really closely. I must say again that the writers know their characters are one-note and they have fun with it. And I would argue that the knowledge of this does make most of the characters somewhat complex and deep (if very slightly). So, all in all, the characters are very good.\nSoundtrack: School Rumble has one of the best opening and ending themes I have heard in a while! It's catchy...very catchy. The rest of the OST in the show is nothing too special, but it does manage to be a little bit above average at some parts of the show.\nArt: The art of the show is quite a risky move in many areas. Sometimes the art looks a little sketchy and incomplete. Sometimes there is a huge amount of shading on a character that goes away in the next shot. Finally, some characters may look a little different from shot to shot at times. However, this \"incomplete\" and sort of \"raw\" art is what gives the show this unique style that makes the art actually very pleasant and unique.\nIn conclusion, a slap in the face has never been so enjoyable! Although some might find it a little repetitive at times, School Rumble succeeds all across the board with a fun, goofy show that for me, gets a solid 8/10. \n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    School Rumble is an anime that comes by every so often that has the ability to make you laugh out loud. This can't be accomplished easily by most since comedy is a hard thing to do. Yet, School Rumble is able to successfully accomplish such. \nPROS\nThe best thing about School Rumble is the comedy. It contains some of the funniest jokes that you will ever come upon in any anime. Tenma, the main girl in the story, is the one who seems to be the funniest out of all the characters. She has a dimwitted charm to her that is interesting, yet questionable. Other moments\n          \n        and characters have their time to shine as well when the humor comes along, but Tenma, for the most part, contains most of the humor that will make you laugh.\nI really enjoyed how each character looked. It made the anime have a very laid-back feel that is often missed in other romantic anime series. At first, I was a bit confused with the choice of style for each character, especially the main male, but I got used to it later on as the series progressed. \nCONS\nThis is yet another anime with a cliche storyline. Guy loves girl, but doesn't know how to tell her. It's been done to death. I have tried to find a way to put this aside, but it is impossible to do. This wasn't a big problem for me since I was so entertained with the humor in the anime. I kind of lost track of the story at one point because I didn't care much for it. Of course, the story never completely goes away. \nOVERALL\nThere isn't much to say about School Rumble. It's a show that is meant to make you laugh. Their is some drama here and there, but I never was invested in such. I didn't care for the characters motivations or goals. This series is all about the comedy. I can't say that enough. Please, if you are planning to watch School Rumble, only do it for the laughs. Everything also is pretty much okay.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    This anime is my favorite school comedy so far. It has one of my favorite male characters of all time (Kenji Harima) and I can re-watch it again and again, laughing every time a little more.\n• STORY: 8 \n(Warning for the average watcher:) This is probably the only weakness of this series. I tell you: If you want a show to have serious progress - do not watch school rumble. If you want a show to have an awesome story line - do not watch school rumble. If you can't stand dumb characters making dumb decisions/taking random actions - do not watch school rumble. The\n          \n        Opening of the 1st term describes it best: The characters move in a circle. It's pretty much the theme of the show, and if you think it's annoying, you'll probably drop the show after 6 episodes or so. (Yet, you should at least check it out)\n\"Then why do you rate the story so high?\" Because this show is about the things that I described above. It's about moving in circles. It's about a stupid love triangle without end and characters incapable of making anything work out. School rumble embraces this idea and takes it to an extreme, I just LOVE how it is done. The jokes are fresh and even if a bit cliche sometimes, they're always executed so well that I can not stop laughing at them. Plus, this show is one giant troll and it doesn't hesitate to fool you as watcher. Everytime when you think \"Now, now something must happen!\" school rumble says \"nope\" and punches you in the face. I think it's hilarious.One can not really blame school rumble for it's core theme, it's more about personal taste and opinion.\nAlso, it's not like it doesn't have ANY character development or story. The series has several sub-plots and refers to past events from time to time. Though the characters stay the same mostly, you can feel small changes in the interaction between them. When the show takes a break from the nonsense-comedy and concentrates on the romance/some drama, it does certainly well. Just ... don't let the show fool you. It's mostly about comedy.\nThe humor: slap-stick, random, trolling (the characters AND the watcher), great use of exaggeration and some puns here and there. At times a little meta.\nAlso, school rumble sometimes refers to other genres/themes or even dives into them for a while (action, supernatural,...). It's really refreshing to see how the show doesn't really care about any genre \"borders\".\nThe 2nd term is a little less good (but still wonderful!), and the 3rd... well... just forget that one. The ending is not good, but that only shows how this series isn't made for any kind of resolution.\n• ART: 7\nMaybe not the best looking Anime, but the animation serves its purpose and strongly supports the comedy. In my opinion, it holds up pretty well. The characters designs are nice and even though the cast is huge, you instantly know who's who and at least I can recall the looks of most characters off the top of my head. Backgrounds looked nice, too.\n• SOUND: 9\nThe soundtrack is wonderful, the sounds always match and work pretty well with what's happening, and the openings as well as the endings are just perfect for the show. I have nothing else to say about it but: Guru guru mawaru...~\nThe voice acting is also good, both japanese and english. And, if everyone cares: The german dub for the 1st term is nicely done, too.\n• CHARACTERS: 10\nOkay. This is completely my taste in characters and I can TOTALLY understand if someone thinks that some characters are boring, annoying...\nBut I just love EVERYONE in this series. Harima especially, he is so - SO - dumb but also very passionate, and his delinquent attitude can't be taken seriously for long. Same goes for Tenma (dumb but passionate) , but I admit that she can be annoying sometimes. The love triangle is one of the weirdest ones I've ever seen, with Karasuma being one of the weirdest characters I've ever seen. Yet I'm totally with Harima and Tenma, finding myself being more invested in their troubles than I should. Maybe it's because I also mess up badly when talking to / just being near the person I like, but woah. I totally feel with these guys.\nAnyway, what really stands out for me are the support characters. Really: There are so many, I remember nearly all of them and their interactions, relationships and attitudes are all just funny, cute and/or perfect. Just to name a few my favorites: Yakumo, Hanai, Akira, Imadori, Lara, Karen, Togo (2nd term)... and there are more. Some relationships are especially remarkable, and I always look forward re-watching scenes. Instead of being a harem around one guy, the show rather presents you several girls/guys that have a crush on each other - though most of them don't make remarkable progress.\nThe variety of characters is stunning, so there should be something for anyone. The 2nd term shows more of the less important support characters, though.  I really can't say anything more but: Outstanding. Just go and watch for yourself.\n• ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 10/10\nI believe you can see on my really one-sided point of view that this anime owns a special place in my heart. It just has everything that I love about school comedy and is even better than I remembered it. I always laugh about it, I can always watch it - I've just fallen for this series. Everything but the ending is perfect. The 2nd term got a little exhausting to the end, but it had it's highlights. Just don't bother about 3rd term, that's a completely mess since they skipped a big part of manga content for a half-ass ending (though the manga did no better).\nIt's possible that you don't like the way school rumble does things, and if that's the case, you should drop the series instead of forcing you to go on. But if you get invested in it, there is no way the show will disappoint you. At least if you skip the ending. ;)\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Today I'd like to review with you guys an anime I recently finished called School Rumble! Since this anime is fairly old and nobody I know talks about it, I figured I might as well check it out. Turns out that anybody who's anybody has seen this show and considers it a classic! Seriously guys, you need to tell me about these things!\nAnyways, let's start off with the basics\nCharacters\nFirst, let's look at my favorite characters in the show. I'll then focus on the few characters that I actually disliked.\nHarima Kenji\nIt's not often that you find a protagonist done this well. Harima's personality is extremely accurate\n          \n        to what a guy in love would be. Also, props to his voice actor; his subtle voice makes me laugh every time. If there's one thing I might want to point out is the fact that he slowly went from big bad delinquent to a mangaka. By the second season, they completely forgot about his delinquent past.\n😍 NOW ONTO THE BEST GIRLS 😍\nTsukamoto Yakumo\nKuuderes don't usually leave a lasting impression on me, but for some reason, I found Yakumo absolutely adorable. I don't know if it was the fact that there was so many episodes to get attracted to her, or that Yakumo and Harima looked absolutely adorable together. Hibiki, I'm aware that Kuuderes are your main fetish, so I promise I'll take it easy on her...\nIchijou Karen\n...BECAUSE I FOUND THIS ANGEL! I love everything about Karen's character, and not because her name is the same as my current favorite waifu. When she was first introduced as a girl apart of the wrestling team, she seemed like an odd character, but after that episode with the moving job, I realized Karen's true beauty! Being a big fan of cute voices, Karen was an absolute must for my waifu list. If there's anything I could complain about, it's the fact that she was in that stupid band. Her voice completely changed when she starts singing, and that threw me off\nOk, that's enough fanboying, let's focus on our other characters.\nCLASS D\nAt first, I thought these guys were extremely annoying. WHY HAVE SO MANY FESTIVAL EPISODES!?!? However, by the end of the show, I considered them very funny side characters that made for a good laugh; especially Lala!\nOmg, she was amazing 😂 Lala was annoying at first, but her shouting became something that I loved.\nNow that those guys have been taken care of, let's briefly take a look at my least favorite characters\nSawachika Eri\nSure, her scenes with Harima were cute and I loved that arc where she was alone with him, but the anime left their relationship unresolved, which made me so frustrated! Also, I'd like to point out her extreme similarities to Sawamura Eriri from Saekano.\nTsukamoto Tenma\nScrew you, Tenma. That's seriously all I can say about a character that messes with Harima's emotions so much.\nAND NOW WE MOVE ONTO A SPECIAL SEGMENT OF MY REVIEW! I BRING TO YOU:\nEVERY SINGLE HAREM PROTAGONIST EVER!\nThe \"I must protect my friends with everything I have!\" Protagonist\nThe \"OPPAI OPPAI I LOVE OPPAI! Gotta get me some!\" Protagonist\n*also, screw you Imadori for messing with Karen's feelings like that*\nThe \"I'm just an average high schooler with absolutely no experience with girls.\" Protagonist\nI could mention a lot more characters that I dislike, but I can't find any sufficient reason to hate them other than that they're annoying.\nMusic\nThe music for School Rumble is terrible. Sure, the first opening and ending is tolerable, but just listen to how terrible it can possibly get\nAnimation\nSince this show is so old, I don't feel that it's right that I should critique it's animation because I'm unaware of the normal expectation from anime back then.\nComedy\nThe jokes in School Rumble rely a lot on the voice acting of Harima and\nThe misunderstandings between the characters.\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nSchool Rumble is a funny and cute romantic comedy that has some of the greatest characters in a school life anime ever. While the music and animation are lacking, I'd suggest looking past that to admire how each relationship plays out.\nOverall: 8/10\nOn another note, if anyone knows where the anime leaves off in the manga, let me know."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n     Main  \nSchool Rumble is an awesomely funny show. There are a lot of scenes that are laugh out loud funny and therefore it's worth watching.\n Art-Style \nDon't expect mind-blowing stuff, it's supposed to be very clean and simple so the animation is average in some parts, but then they do use CG here and there so you can see they are capable of going wild with the art and animation. My guess is they kept it basic looking for it to look more manga-like and the CG is just for visual effect or to really show a character's emotion thru visual experience. Just\n          \n        like how they will change the art-style just for dramatic and humorous punctuation.\n Sound \nI LOVE the OP. Very cheery, positive and happy. It's the type of song that will stick in your head or maybe get you to try to learn the lyrics so you can sing it for karaoke but it may not be a song you would buy and listen to on a daily basis, since it is a bit like children's music. The ED is also a very child-like, but it's a very cool song, it's only child-like on the surface but if you listen to the song and the arrangement it's really sophisticated. That's why I like it.\n Story \nAgain, very simple show using a very simple formula. There are no huge theatrics or confusingly, dramatic plot twists and that's why I love it. Even though there are a lot of dramatic art and stuff sometimes it's really just to accentuate the feelings of the characters within that certain moment. But it's really a light funny story, like reading a comic strip......Kinda like Azumanga Daioh!\n Cast/Characters \nThere are no ugly or annoying characters, they were all attractive and likable in their own way. Sometimes I get confused when it comes to shows with a lot of school girls, because I can't tell if it's for the purpose of it being shoujo or to attract a lot of male viewership. Either way all the girls were very cute and each had their own unique traits so you won't get confused, I liked all 5 of the main girls: Tenma, Yakumo, Akira, Eri and Miko [I also love Lala...she was so aggressive]. There are also so cute guys in this series which I hope come back for part two....if so then I will talk about them more in the part two review.\n Worth it or NOT? \nThis a very funny show. I would recommend this to people who like funny and simplistic shows like Azumanga Daioh, you can watch this and chase those blues away!"},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    If you've seen a romantic comedy, you could say you have seen them all. Most romcoms tend to be repetitive, to the point where you can't tell them apart. Most of them have the same plot, and overuse the feared, predictable love triangle and misunderstandings to create conflict and drama.\nThat's where School Rumble says: \"fuck you\". \nThis series is unlike any romcom I have ever watched. I could go as far as calling it a romantic comedy deconstruction, since it takes the concept of a romcom, smashes it into pieces and twists it. Basically, School Rumble is to romcoms what Gintama is to shounen series.\nThe\n          \n        love triangles and misunderstandings, which are sources of drama and conflict in romcoms, have a new purpose in School Rumble: to create laughter. It's so hilarious to see characters getting through so much shit just because they misunderstood a name or a situation.\nAnd speaking of characters, this is maybe the strongest feature of this show. I wouldn't say it is my favorite cast ever, but I have had lots of fun with them, and I could easily name them all, since everyone had a distinct characteristic at least. There are some characters such as Akira or Imadori that fall flat, but there are more seasons, so I hope they get more screen time. I like how characters change so subtle during this series, and how their relationships develop. \nThe character designs and the overall audiovisuals are pretty mediocre. Minus points for horrible CGI, but it was made in 2004, so at least it has an excuse. It doesn't affect the overall quality of the show tho.\nIn conclusion, I strongly recommend this anime if you are looking for a different romcom, that actually makes you laugh and has memorable and enjoyable characters. \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    oh well...Last night, I finished School Rumble, but found myself getting in trouble over and over today at work because I kept losing my composure and randomly laughing to myself over scenes of the show that kept playing over and over in my head.\nTo say that this show is hilarious may be a sore understatement. It's a good possibility this is the funniest show I've ever seen. The perfect amount of Drama sprinkled on top of this heavy Romantic/Comedy make the recipe for success.\nMuch to my surprise, there's even a bit of depth to this Romantic Comedy...\nTenma Tsukamoto is a total dunce...but one who is\n          \n        totally in love with her classmate Ooji Karasuma. He is preparing to transfer when she makes it her mission to write him a love letter as a last ditch effort to get him to stay. Kenji Harima is a juvenile deliquent who is in love with his classmate Tenma, and has become tame to the idea of going to class in order to get closer to her...this triangle of one sided, occasionally delusional love is just the beginning to the hilarious antics of the cast of School Rumble...\nStory: (7/10)\nDespite the fact the story is as straight forward as it can be, (A romantic comedy normally doesn't stray far from its standard formula) there is actually a well put together story with a noticable progression. \nIt starts off fairly slowly, but as the other characters become more key to the plot (after around 10 episodes or so) the simple triangle of Tenma/Kenji/Ooji becomes more complex, involving other characters into the ensuing craziness.\nThere's a few holes in the story that the second installment has plenty of time to fix.\nAnimation: (7/10)\nIt's energetic, upbeat, and knows the perfect time to blank out other characters on screen to make the timing of a joke hit so much harder. You'll often find yourself wondering what's about to happen as they do a closup of Harima as he slowly riles himself up before having some crazy outburst.\nFew of the characters stand out as far as their looks and appearence, save Kenji Harima, who is a very unique and excellent idea for a male protagonist.\nYakumo's mind reading ability and the way that Kanji characters appear and chase over the heads of people in her vicinity is just awesome, a concept I don't think I've seen before.\nSound: (9/10)\nThe opening theme Scramble, sung by Horie Yui (Who also did the voice for Eri Sawachika) is very zany, and catchy. Whether I particularly liked this song or not, it's definately been stuck in my head since the first time I've heard it.\nThe ending theme Onna no Ko Otoko no Ko is also fairly catchy, and just plain silly. A chibi of Harima goes through a series of motions as the \ncredits roll.\nSR screams silliness, and hilarity even in the most subtle ways. The sound effects are a very important part of the unique comedy of the show also: An example of this in Episode 2 when Harima mouths to Tenma and as the Kanji appears on screen, the sound of a typewriter goes in the background.\nCharacter: (10/10)\nIf there is one factor that contributes above all to School Rumble's amazing humour factor, it has to be its colorful cast...\nEvery schoolkids cliché is present here: The airheaded but super friendly one, the perfect and beautiful girl who doesn't realize her appeal, the tomboyish girl who can kick any guys ass, the spoiled and snobby princess, the deliquent who rarely goes to class, the straightedge, and of course, the lackies. The gang is all here... but what School Rumble has that so many others don't, is charm, and buckets of it.\nAll of the important characters are very in-depth, and you get to know them all fairly well before it's all said and done. The other main characters (Eri, Mikoto, Yakumo, Imadori, and Hanai) are actually interesting enough, that seeing their stories develop was so appealing at times, that keeping up with them took precedence over the main two. Even Karasuma, who is as one-dimensional and bland as they get, was made to be so purposely...it's what makes Tenma's attraction to him, and the time they spend together during the show, so funny.\nThere's also some interesting romances that begin developing at such odd points in the show, and they actually GO somewhere with it later. In alot of other shows, they'd start on something, then drop the ball.\nOverall Rating: (8.25/10)\nPerhaps the most fun and comedic show I've seen to date. In the meantime, I'll eagerly anticipate the next installment.\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    School Rumble is an Anime that I personally cherish very much, considering the premise behind it. This series has some of my favorite characters in all of Anime, and this is a series I'm more than glad to recommend. \nStory: 9/10\nThe story revolves around a guy and a girl who try to pursue their crush to no avail due to many misunderstandings. The girl, who is named Tenma, tries to get the attention of her crush, named Karasuma, which usually doesn't work out well. The guy, named Harima, tries to get attention of his crush, which is Tenma, to which it also doesn't work out\n          \n        well. For the most part, that is the main story, but there are many sub stories with all the various characters of the show, both the main and supporting characters. \nArt: 8/10\nThe art was very nice, the character designs were well done. The clothes used by the characters usually matched their personality or status (Example would be Harima's clothing makes him look like a delinquent, or Eri wearing fancy clothes due to her wealth). One thing I really enjoyed was the fact that there wasn't any fanservice during a beach and pool episode, which also showed basically normal teenagers enjoying a day at the beach or pool. \nSound: 9/10\nThe OP is really nice and catchy, having a ditsy tune that matches the nature of the show, and one of the most memorable and favorite OPs to an Anime for me. The ED is also very good, having a song about boys chasing and thinking about girls all day long, which sets up the idea of what Harima is doing in regards to Tenma. The voice acting was very nice, each of the characters had a voice that matched their personality very well. \nCharacter: 10/10\nAs I mentioned, this anime has some of the characters I have enjoyed the most in a series. Harima is the male protagonist, having one of the most radical character developments I have seen, starting out as a delinquent who doesn't care for school to being a regular guy who expresses himself through drawing Manga and attending classes. Tenma is the female protagonist, knowing to be a sweet and childish girl for her age (16), but she strives to be seen as a woman. There's Tenma's crush, Karasuma, who is seen to be a very stoic character, who shows little to no emotions, but is filled with talent. Eri is one of Tenma's friends who is the \"rich girl\" of the school, but uses this image to hide her loneliness and insecurities that surround her life. Mikoto is the Tomboy of the group who is tough and athletic, but she knows how to comfort her friends when they need it. Akira is another friend of Tenma who is intelligent, calm, resourceful, perceptive, and mysterious. Yakumo is Tenma's younger sister (despite that many people believe she is the older sibling) who is quiet, beautiful, shy, smart and mature, having many talents that sparks interest in people who see her. Finally, Hanai is the childhood friend of Mikoto who tends to keep his class in order, all while trying to win the love of Yakumo. \nEnjoyment: 10/10\nFor an anime that is a Romantic Comedy, this really does fit the description of that, having scenes of both romance and comedy. There was many scenes that put a smile on my face, as well as those that made me chuckle, giggle or laugh. It's a very silly series that shows a fun light in the topic of adolescent romance, and it's possible to come out liking many, if not, all of the characters for how they are and how they interact to each other and with various situations. \nOverall: 10/10\nThis is one of the first series I finished in anime, and it was amazing. The episodes had me hooked from the beginning and they're mainly random, but they help the plot move well. There's many things I really enjoyed from this anime, but the main part were the characters, especially Harima and Yakumo, mainly for their personalities. If you want an anime that will make you laugh and smile, as well as take a different route from the various harems and fanservice common in romantic comedies, then this one is for you. I recommend this normally for those that are starting to watch anime. \n        "},

The eccentric characters and even weirder plot twists are very funny and leave much for the mind to crave. The weird love relationships in this story keep you clicking episode after episode, hoping they find a resolve to their romance, but I'm sorry to tell you this people, there's no happy ending.\n*SPOILER ALERT*\nAfter the first season, you think they have found a resolution, but no they didn't, although funny (and literally out of this world) its just a hallucination. Then once you get to the second season, even more\n          \n        confusion arises, especially towards the ending (again).\nLet's put it this way, if you are one of those people who watch anime because of it's length then watch this. If your one of those people who watch for its great plot and definite ending (and I stress this enough) don't watch this. Even the OVA kind of ticked me off because it jumps off nowhere and leaves me lost.\nOverall I give this anime an 7.5/10, only because of the ending...stupid ending!\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Yeah.. It has been veeerry long time since i wrote my latest review. This time, School Rumble! One of my favourite comedy anime so far. Overall, this anime fulfill my needs. Needs of laughter. Yep, I laughed so hard. Many times. The story and characters were awesome. Alright, that’s for short, and.. here are the details.\nFirst, the story. It seems ordinary though, just telling about high school life of Harima Kenji and his friends. He entered high school, met new friends, etc etc. But wait, the main plot of this series is about romantic comedy. Okay, sounds ordinary. The interesting thing was its character relationship.\n          \n        Triangle love everywhere, awkward moment everywhere, and unrequited love everywhere. And wow.. just WOW. Hahaha.. many moments made me laughed so hard, especially when it comes to WRONG TIMING that made awkward moments xD. But well, actually this series have random plot. Not really random though, still easy to understand and have interconnections. And you will definitely laugh if you realized it, LOL. \nNext, the character. This series have very good character development. Seems real, hilarious, and didn’t look stupid. The main protagonist, Harima, for example. He looks manly, have big motorcycle, and looks tough. Very typical for a delinquent. But once he must face THIS one thing: LOVE, he changed into a different person. He couldn’t express his feelings at all, and got depressed very easily when he got love problems. His trait often trigger misunderstandings. Many misunderstandings means many awkward moments. The final result is.. LAUGHTER. That’s School Rumble. For example, imagine a situation when you were naked in a room and then a girl accidentaly entered your room. What will you do? And then the situation came worse: another girl came and saw you with that girl. That’s awkward. Very awkward but really funny xD.\nThird, the artwork and sound. I like both of them. The shounen-style artwork looks very good. The boys look good, the girls look cute and sexy. That’s really satisfying for such an old anime. Not really old, by the way.. LOL. Animation? THIS. I loved it. Very nice and fluid. Just look at the bicycle scene or the arrow scene. They were well-done and awesome! About the OST, not really good, IMO. The only song I liked is “Scramble” by Yui Horie (Sawachika Eri’s seiyuu). Very good and catchy/\nEnjoyment? Well, as a fan of comedy anime, if an anime can made me laugh, I enjoyed it VERY much. This series somehow always found a way to make me laugh so hard. The joke, punchlines, were just.. really funny and epic. Moreover, its story is quite close to real life. I liked that kind of anime.. xD\nLast, this anime is very recommended for you who loved comedy anime. I mean, real comedy. Not just shitty fanservice-based perverted jokes. Meh. This series offered much better jokes than those “comedy” animes. LOL xD\nEnjoy! :D\n"},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    This is… I have no idea how to talk about this show. The whole idea of the show is that it has one small plot and then thrusts all of the most awkward timing and puns into the show. It also has so many love triangles in it that it you never know whats going on.\nTenma is rather a dunce and can’t do most things right although she does have her times where she actually seems a bit smart (example, when she is trying to get out of the girls bathroom without Karasuma seeing her) only to have it thrust back at her. She is\n          \n        scatter brained and has as much sence as a bag of rice but deep inside, she has a heart of gold. She tries to make everyone happy including her love, Karasima. She is so scatter brained that when Haruma tries to confess his love to her, she doesn’t get it. She has this really interesting way of talking as though she is talking to a little kid or is herself a little kid. It’s odd because her younger sister actually acts more like an older sister then she does.\nHarima is a really odd character in that he acts a lot like a bad ass and has trouble looking like a nice guy even when he is around the girl of his dreams. For instance, in the second episode, since Harima has been coming to school every day now, his classmates suspect he is planning a bomb threat! When he starts to laugh, they believe he is planning something worse. I consider him not as dumb as Tenma since he actually has street smarts but on the other hand, it isn’t that much smarter. \nKarasuma is more of the mysterious side character rather then a main character. He might be the object of Tenma’s affection, but he rarly shows up in the show. He is just a silent person who sits there and blends into the background except for the really odd things he does like rides his bike fast or dressing as a Kappa in the rain. \nThere are so many characters that I can’t talk about all of them or I would be here all day. From Tenma’s friends to Haruma’s strange antics, this show pretty much jumps all over the place. And why do I like such a zany show like this when I hate Puni Puni Poemii? Well, for starters, this show does stop itself from time to time from going to out of control. It holds back many times while other times, the stuff feels spaced out. \nSome people don’t like how scattered around this show is, pretty much like Azumanga and Lucky Star but I have to say, at least this show has some sort of plot and sticks to it slightly. I do have to say there are pretty much no adults in this show to stop them from doing stupid things. It’s really all over the place.\nThe art is actually pretty fun and energetic. It’s all over the place depending on the mood but the artwork never goes against the mood. It keeps it flowing till such a time that they feel its time to jerk us back from it. Sometimes it’s so detailed, and sometimes its really abstract. \nThe English voices are really good, making me smile. They matched all the voices pretty well to how the characters act and even some of the Japanese voices. There really isn’t much else to say about it."},

I had to write this review because I wanted to think of the good times after I watched \"School Days\" and cried, and became sad. Anyways, now that that's over, let's talk a bit about School Rumble.\nYou should watch it. If you're a fan of being happy, having a good time, and laughing, and watching people fall in love, then you need to watch this. It has one of the most unique, and interesting casts out of any anime that I have seen to date. This show made me smile\n          \n        in every episode, even in the filler!\nI promise you that it will make you smile too! I don't want to spoil too much, but the love triangle gives you a lot to look forward too. You will probably find yourself marathon-ing the entire anime (2nd season, and OVA's included) just like I did. While I usually watch anime in Japanese audio, this is one of the few like Samurai Champloo, that had an excellent English cast. However, you'll have to have Japanese audio if you make it to the 3rd season/2nd OVA.\nIn the end, there is filler, and I was a bit disappointed by the ending not having English voices, and being so sudden and slightly lacking, but I hope that it leaves room for more School Rumble in the future. Could it possibly happen? Haha, in my dreams! \n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    When I first heard about School Rumble (not too long ago), I thought it was just another comedy/drama set in school environment with all cliches and such. This presumption was partly correct, yet I was rather surprised when I saw about half of the episodes.\nIt is pretty generic love-triangle setup, about Tenma Tsukamoto, a 16 year old high-school girl who loves silent, rather \"weird\" person called Karasuma, while Kenji Harima loves Tenma with all his heart. Every time someone tries to confess something, either something goes wrong more or less or interrupts them. Generic huh? Tenma is rather clumsy, somewhat dumb girl who lives with\n          \n        her sister. Karasuma is a silent character who has very good poker-face, while Harima is deliquent person who posses high psychical traits and strength. Also he has very bad temper. The entire reason why Harima goes to school is Tenma, while an old memory still haunts Harima. Coincidentally, the memory is related to Tenma.\nThis series also concentrates about Tenma's friends and such, like her sister Yakumo.\nOverall, the characters are bit cliche alike, but quite believable ones. Like Sawachika reminds me very much about one person I had in my class back in my high school days. Many others are also quite believable, but also there are some that just doesn't feel right.\nOne thing that really surprised me, was the humor section of the series. I was expecting generic humor (like write a long love letter but forget to put your name on it), but the way it is done is excellent. Most of the stuff can be actually guessed beforehand, but the way they have been implemented in the series is really great. Somethings are just generic jokes and such that make you to wonder \"Was that supposed to be funny?\", but some can make you really crying out loud while laughing.\nOverall, this is warmly recommended if you just can stand another school drama. The way the overall concept works in School Rumble is very good. Much better than I expected. One good reason is also, that the way it works out in some places can make you possibly remember some old memories from your own high school days.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Story: First, I would like to say that the story of School Rumble is one roller-coaster ride of humor and enjoyment. You can expect to have a good laugh in every episode because there's so much weirdness going on with the two main protagonists; Harima (ex-delinquent) and Tenma. The story is basically about Harima, who used to be a delinquent that would fight with gang members, but when he saw Tenma (cute girl he saw), he falls in love with her. The other main character, Tenma, is your clumsy-slow school girl that is in love with a classmate in her class (Karasuma; looks like an\n          \n        uncool big nerd lol). So, what do you have when one person likes this person, but that person like another person? You have a a conflict lol. The love triangle between Harima, Tenma, and Karasuma. What makes you crave more of this anime, is how the tough ex-delinquent Harima is now being soft around when he's around Tenma lol. Lastly, what I like about the story, is how Tenma is so dumb to not notice that in some scenes, Harima portrays affection to her. Watch the anime yourself and you'll see the comedy in this. :)\nArt: The art is pretty good. Not that astonishing, so an 8 is a fair rating for it.\nSound: I thoroughly enjoy listening to both the opening and ending of School Rumble. I believe you'll get hook to the opening/ending of this anime. :) It's just those songs that will get stuck in your head.\nCharacters: All of the characters are really funny in their own way. I think there's like all types of characters in this anime. Also, I like how they have tons of characters in this (just like Bleach and Naruto). \nEnjoyment: I really enjoy this anime. I had endless laughter from watching this and it's just one of those anime, where you can't stop watching and wanting to know what's going to happen in the next episode\nOverall: I would give this anime a 9. The humor and comedy are mainly the reasons for it. I recommend everyone to watch this and you won't regret it. :)\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I started out watching the School Rumble anime (English sub, I unfortunately don’t understand the Japanese language) and really just expected it to be what it appeared to be – a funny comedy anime. I was partially right about that, but also VERY wrong. School Rumble, on the surface, doesn’t seem very serious. But so many things underneath the surface of it are very serious and insightful and even deeply moving. Soon after starting the anime I was hooked, and almost immediately related to Harima Kenji and began cheering him on to accomplish his goal. Throughout the beginning and middle of the series we see\n          \n        Harima failing over and over at his attempts to confess his feelings to Tenma. At first it’s laughable how silly and avoidable the misunderstandings are. Then as the series continues and you begin to see the toll it takes on Harima and the amount of pain it starts to cause him it begins to get less and less bearable to watch. Of course with all the other great characters and stories in School Rumble you are still thoroughly hooked on the series, and besides, you feel that you have to see the series through to the end to see if Harima wins the heart of the girl he loves. You also feel you have to see what happens with Hanai, Eri, Yakumo, Ichijou, Mikoto, and all the other very well written and interesting characters. The ending of the first season makes you think Harima finally confesses his love to Tenma, but it ends up being imaginary. At this point I was physically fatigued and drained from the roller coaster of emotions and disappointments throughout the first season. But at the same time I couldn’t wait to watch the second season. The second season was great of course, although in the Harima and Tenma storyline it just got more and more painful to watch. More misunderstandings, more missed opportunities, more outside interference and assumptions of who Harima did or didn’t like from his classmates. More oblivousness from Tenma as she chases after the completely blank Karasuma. The second season wraps up with no resolution. So, disappointed and borderline depressed I watch the 3rd season, which is actually just two OVAs.\nResult: Complete and utter heart wrenching emptiness. Harima has been emotionally tortured and left to die basically. Tenma is gone to America to be with Karasuma and become a nurse to take care of him because he is in the hospital there with a condition that has wiped out his memory. He doesn’t even know who she is but she still wants to be with him. Harima does not get the girl. In fact no one gets anyone. Almost every story line is left unfinished.\nI was fully depressed and left with an empty feeling inside. That’s the best way I can describe it. I had to have answers. I found the manga and began reading immediately.\nAfter reading through the ENTIRE manga and then the follow up manga “School Rumble Z” I had to face harsh reality…….there was NO conclusion. No happy couples, no loose ends tied up, no happily ever after or riding off into the sunset. Just more emptiness and depression. It was as if the characters had been killed in the prime of their lives and their futures were cut short. There is no way you can understand the way it feels unless you’ve been on this journey that is School Rumble. It’s incomparable.\nI couldn’t believe it. I searched all over the internet for any and all information about School Rumble and it’s creator Jin Kobayashi. I began reaching out to fans and hearing their stories that were the same as mine. The way they felt at the end of it all was like my story. The wave of emotions: shock and disbelief, confusion, emptiness, depression, and bitterness.\nThere is much much more to this story. But that’s basically how I got started on this mission to reach Mr. Kobayashi. There have been moments of slight progress, and a few disappointments. Ups and downs, feeling like I’m all alone in this, and then feeling the love and support of School Rumble fans from many different countries around the world. One thing is certain, I have no plans of EVER giving up.\nIn closing, here’s the motto: Justice for Harima, closure for the fans, may the hero get his girl, may his spring finally come.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC05xAG4hMwmeu4XdFei9Ywg"},

I've been thinking very often to maybe start reading the manga from where Ni Gakki (season 2) ends to where San Gakki (season 3 consisting of 2 OVA episodes) ends just to get some more of it. But yet I still pray for the day when a full season 3 will come. But nontheless, let's start with this review!\nAnimation: Nothing special here. Just what you\n          \n        would expect from a random high school anime... Only with much, much more facial distortion! Some of the faces in this show are hilarious, but unfortunately it looks too simplistic in my taste with nothing to really please my eyes with. This art style does however start to grow on you and you start to appreciate it for what it is, even if you would have wanted something more out of it.\nSound: Even though there aren't very many songs in its OST, they are thankfully very memorable! There are alot of variety in the songs style which is always a good thing. From laidback, to comedic, to sad, to happy. The opening was sung by Horie Yui (Featuring Unscandal) and is called Scramble. And to be honest... It might be my favourite opening to any comedy anime ever! I just love it! The ending is saddly not as memorable; Onna no Ko Otoko no Ko sung by Ogura Yuuko might actually be one of my least favourite endings to any comedy anime ever! The voice cast in School Rumble does a solid performance and brings a lot of emotions to the characters who they are voicing. Oh and let's not forget the legendary song School Rumble 4 Ever!\nStory: Seeing how this is a slapstick comedy anime, you know that you aren't gonna get a great story. It's basically about a guy who loves one girl who loves another boy. Let's just say that... Things don't always go the way these characters want them to. But even so the main story still manages to entertain you enough to wanna make you keep on watching.\nCharacter: Ah yes, now this is where School Rumble really shines! The cast in School Rumble may be one of the best casts in any anime I've ever seen! You got the goofy girl Tenma, the weirdo Karasuma, the spanish wrestler Lala, the pervert Imadori, the mysterious Akira, the ojou Sawachika and the list goes on and on... But there is one certain character that steals the entire show. You who have seen the show know exactly who I'm talking about! I'm of course talking about the man, the legend, the myth, the one and only: Harima Kenji! How can you not love this guy! The guy is as manly as you can be! Now, every character develops very nicely during the show, and no one can disagree with me that School Rumble may have one of the best character developments in any comedy anime. But Harima takes the price himself! Never have I seen a character go through so many changes both physically and mentally! Watching Harima is the same thing as watching a small child grow into a man!\nEnjoyment: This anime will entertain you in more ways than one. It will make you laugh your lungs out, while at the same time manage to sympathise with the characters. I never once got bored while watching this anime and that is saying a lot!\nWith all the fun gags and the development of all characters, School Rumble is an anime I would say is perfect to rewatch! How could you even get bored with this hilarious anime?!\nSo all in all, School Rumble is an anime you should definitely watch if you want a fun anime that's got excellent character development and always manages to deliver! Watch it now!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    School Rumble is a great anime comedy.  The main characters are Tenma Tsukamoto and Harima Kenji.  Tenma's in love with a boring lifeless dude from her class named Karasuma.  Harima is in love with Tenma.  Basically we have a unrequited love triangle with slice of life and crack anime elements thrown in.  It's never boring although it probably falls into one of those love it or hate it types of anime.  I personally love it.  The characters are all very well developed and you can't help but route for them.  Another note of interest:  I have\n          \n        seen both the English dub and Japanese with fansubs versions.  I think they are both very good though some of the cultural jokes are lost in the English version.  The actual dub voices seem to fit the characters very well in my opinion.  I highly recommend this anime, it's definitely one of my recent favorites.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Season 1 of School Rumble is actually an enjoyable watch. It follows the manga pretty closely, except for some parts where they change it a bit. This school life anime actually brings in humor and romance which are very well developed. This anime is probably one of the top school life animes I have seen in a while. Definitely a must watch, especially if you want to see airheads to the maximum. \nStory: The story is pretty good, we can see development in the romance, slowly but surely. The school life setting is good and how each character connects with one another also brings in\n          \n        some good side-stories. The amount of misunderstanding is actually so over the top that it makes for a good laugh. The one - sided love of all these characters are very interesting. For me, the story revolves around Harima, he is \"the man\". The story about a delienquent in love is perfect and how he changes so drastically from his old self. The one thing I don't like about it is when they show some scenes that are from his manga. Also, it keeps going back to the starting point with HarimaxTenma, which is frustrating but also keeps you going. So the story is a 8/10 for me.\nArt: No complaints, every character is beautifully drawn. The sakura trees and everything is also good. The plainness in Karasuma and the actions he does can't make you ignore him. The art got a little sloppy as the story progressed but it was good. Also, I liked it when they did some \"realistic\" art. It was funny to look at Tenma's face when she did that. Eri is drawn very well, a typical Half-Japanese, but different in some ways. Mikoto is also very well drawn. When Harima becomes so manly or when they exxagerate his muscles or body, it actually gives a good impact and laugh. I must say all the female characters are really cute and all the man characters are really interesting. I gave it a 10/10 just because there is not really a major flaw in it.\nSound: The soundtrack is good. Nothing that interesting. The opening theme is ok. It was nice to listen to the first time, but it got pretty boring in the end. The ending theme is good. It wasn't outstanding, but it can be listened to and put in a playlist. The sound in the background is good. It actually fits during some moments. During suspenseful or tearful moments, the music in the background actually makes my heart ache. It is such a compliment with what is happening that I gave the sound rating a 9/10. Even if the op and ed was average, the background makes up for it. Especially the nature scenes or oceans. The voice actors fit the characters very well. There is no awkward ones and they bring out the full potential of the character.\nCharacter: Haha, the characters are all very interesting. I'll go through character by character for this one.\nTenma - She is cute, adorable and a huge retard (in a nice way). Her extraordinary low iq questions me if such a human is possible. She has turtles for almost every subject, she misunderstands every situation presented to her, and she also think she knows everything. This type of character is so unique and you can't hate her either. She's just too innocent. I love Tenma, she is funny to watch and you can't predict what she is going to do next. Shes a huge idiot, but I like her that way. Her taste in men is also hilarious. \nYakumo - A reliable sister and actually is a very good sibling pair. Tenma and Yakumo together are total opposites, but their relationships are very strong. I like Yakumo's character. She is cool and calm and has a super psychic ability. Her unability to express herself is kind of frustrating though. \nEri - Great character and very original. A wealthy half Japanese is common in most animes if they do have this type, but she is also funny in her own way. Her jealousy levels spike a lot. Her character as a wealthy person makes it a funny story and she is just too cute. She has her sad moments and is also a good person at heart. Her ability to care for her friends is also interesting, since most people portray these rich types as selfish ingrates. Eri is different and she also has a beautiful romantic side. \nMikoto - A dojo girl, her character is good. Her personalitiy really stands out among the girls and it is so unique to have a martial artists person. Her athletic abilities really bring awe to the audeince and I enjoy watching her. There isn't much to say about her, but she is a good character in general. \nTakano - One word: cool.\nHarima - The biggest idiot alive and also creates the comedy situations. We see him change so much in the anime. He becomes a delinquent to a person who attends school everyday to a fortune teller and back to the romantic self. I must say the situations he create is epic and I get great laughs. His dramatic effects and love for Tenma is so extreme that it makes me feel bad for him when he doesn't succeed. \nEnjoyment: I loved the anime. It follows closely to the manga and the humor is epic. But some parts are really boring and pointless that it takes down the level. If there wasn't so much pointless stuff, it would be good. Dont' get me wrong, some of the pointless stuff is worth watching and hilarious, but it was just way too much.\nOverall: A good watch, a must see school life romantic comedy show. I am giving it a 9/10 since it is not perfect.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    School Rumble is a typical romantic anime in which one person likes another who likes another and so on. After watching the first episode I immediately knew this wasn't going to have a deep story. But an anime doesn't need a good story to be great, School Rumble justifies this idea. The characters in the series are colorful and unique in their own special ways and are memorable even after watching the series. The characters also develop throughout the story, slowly at first but then more drastically near the end. Each episode has a light feel to it and you can never tell what's going\n          \n        to happen next. The animation isn't anything new but it's hard to tell when your enjoying the wild antics of the characters. From start to finish the show never stops showing the wild acts of the characters and always makes you laugh just one more time. If you're looking for an anime to cheer you up then School rumble is perfect for you. It makes you laugh without being to serious.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    \"You eventually awaken from a dream, but... memories sparkle forever...\" \n'*As the scene opens there is a soft voice* \"I love you\" what wondrous words. The moment I say them, the world changes. Magical words... I'm going to say them... to you. *cue shot of cute girl*'\n\"Such a lovely if straightforward way to begin a romance/ comedy anime!\" one may be tempted to think. And in a way that person (We will call him Bob) would be correct. School Rumble has these things. There are elements of comedy that will have Bob nearly crying from laughter and harem/romance elements that will have Bob smiling and\n          \n        possibly blushing at the mishaps our characters make as multiple relationships (real and pseudo) are explored. \nBut if Bob had expectations of a genuine Love Hina clone, Bob will be surprised (And most likely pleasantly) to discover that these elements are only the beginning.\nSchool Rumble is a show which is less than simple to characterize. In addition to the humour and relationships standard to the listed genres there is action, fighting, 3D animations, drama, and much more.  And for the most part, it is done in a logical and realistic manner with a +2 continuity bonus.\nOne might find themselves captivated by this anime as it is so... Generally enjoyable.  One may indeed find themselves preparing the better part of entire days to watch all of the episodes consecutively (The author concedes that he was one of these people).\nOn this note, what follows is a short synopsis and review.\nTenma Tsukamoto is an energetic second year high school student \"and just as all young girls,\" has fallen in love. The object of her affection is one Oji Karasamu, who is a bit unusual. On the other side of the fence is Kenji Harima, one of the rough-exterior, soft-hearted \"delinquents\" of the high school. Unbeknownst to Tsukamoto, Harima is intensely in love with her (Claiming that she is the reason he is still in school) and what follows is an entertaining, humorous, and charming experience that combines a myriad of supporting characters with a plot that provides surprises and laughs in many  interesting ways.\nStory\nThere is a weakness that is evident in many anime placed in similar categories: No real, overarching issue or plot device other than finding love and reconciling the multiple relationships, especially concerning the main protagonists. In addition although it deals with relationships, there are fewer (really) gooey romancey portions of the story than a romance-lover may enjoy. \nThat said the story as a whole is well done, combining multiple characters with multiple plotlines into a large intertwining story that is entertaining  right to the end of every episode. The pacing is done realistically, with the small portions of filler and fan service material generally placed in synergy with the main story material. There is a consistent feeling that there is little seriousness; this anime likes to make fun of anime clichés, itself, and culture: In one episode a seaman washes overboard during a storm and rather than helping one crewman yells, \"[he] can't swim!\"  after a few seconds one replies, \"Why is he working on a boat!?\". And while it can be argued that there are not a large number of passionate love scenes, this does not detract from the story which is upbeat and focussed more so on the general experience of being in love and \"In a dream season of adolescence\" than on any one situation. The ending... Well, that has to be experienced.\nPresentation:\nThe animation for some of the scenes was less than amazing, and there was an occasional replaying of a song.\nHowever  the art was well implemented, in many cases switching between and combining chibi art, standard 2D fare, a hand-drawn look, and 3D animation for some scenes. The still pictures of the girls and the environments were expectedly top-notch. Above par for an anime aired in 2004 (my gripes about some of the animation would likely go away if I had seen it in 1080). The intelligent usage of transitions and timing for the scenes helped to increase the enjoyability by cutting and panning at just the right time. Looking  at the characters from the proper perspective gave extra immersion to situations. Despite some minor repetition the music was actually quite impressive, managing to add to the impact of events; at most points, it was used flawlessly.\nCharacters:\nSchool Rumble's characters shine radiantly. The characters are diverse and dynamic; hardly relegated to the standard archetypes long-time watchers of anime would be used to. These archetypes are apparent when the characters are introduced, but soon give way to their inner workings as they struggle and triumph, fall and regain composure, and are exposed to a variety of different experiences.  Bob might be shocked to learn that indeed Harley-riding, school skipping, fighting for fun Harima (one of the most badass and well placed male characters in a romance anime ever, in my opinion) can be both the most hardcore delinquent and a big softy at the same time. This is a massive difference from the far too common highly unmanly male protagonists that aren't particularly skilled or pronounced (the author might reference a certain Keitaro in this instance). School Rumble peels back the psychological onion of many of the characters through direct action and indirect characterization, providing a gentle yet lively pace of discovery that is very interesting.  Characters are often quite logical while still being comical.\nIn conclusion, School Rumble is an experience that can be summed up (and I imagine Bob would agree) as an immersive, enjoyable experience with few downsides. A good story, great presentation and fantastic characters combine to provide a memorable experience.  One will find enough light-hearted enjoyment to pass time laughing, and enough depth and characterization to actually provide a reason for one to care about and become psychologically involved with the story. \nThere is another season of this extraordinary experience. The author is excitedly planning, between work and school, the next few days that can be devoted to immersing himself in the next chapter. If you haven't had the pleasure of watching this one, the author (And Bob, the author is sure) recommends you do so as soon as can be managed.\n        "},

Sure, it doesn't move along in plot. You could, theoretically, pick it up from any point in the anime and still get the basics of what was going on so long as you knew a little background information about the characters.\nIts simply a\n          \n        very long winded love triangle. Tenma Tsukamoto, the female protagonist of this story, is a dim-witted, but ultimately kind-hearted and lovable teenage girl completely head over heels in love with Oji Karasuma, the strong silent type, who is a little bit weird and keeps to himself doesn't seem to return her feelings. Kenji Harima is the school delinquent, also dim-witted, overly-confident of his abilities in love, and head-over-heels in love with Tenma. What follows is the most brilliant set of ploys on both parts to get the attention of the one they love.\nThe good thing is it's not all about them. Mikoto, Eri and Akira, Tenma's best friend's and the very beautiful, very popular trio of the class, start off as your basic fillers for extra characters but become something more valuable as the series progresses. Yakumo, Tenma's shy, beautiful younger sister, who only gets angry if her sister is insulted, provides an almost mother-like attitude to the series. And Hanai, the sporty braniac who grew up with Mikoto and is ridiculously head-over-heels in love with Yakumo.\nBasically, don't start watching this series expecting a fast moving plot, the girl ending up with the guy and all living happily ever after by the end of the 26 episodes. Don't even expect that by the end of the 2nd season! You will be sorely disappointed.\nHowever, if you go into this expecting a brilliant set of characters, hilarious plots, laugh-out-loud moments, and even 'Wait, what the heck was that about?' moments, you will enjoy every last minute of this fantastic anime.

That's how good it is if you really want a good laugh.  The drawings and graphics get better as you go further into the series.  It's up to you if you want to watch the Anime or the Manga version.  The manga version continues even after the Anime ends. Sooo.. yea decide on that.\n"},

XD\nYou follow along with the two main characters of this story : Tenma, and Harima. (Everyone else is the side-characters [although they are seen alot and involve in the story throughout the show] but these two are legitly the main)\nSo. Harima, that badass of the school. Big, tough, strong, mean, nasty, an all around deliquent. He even rides a motorcycle! Grade A badass~\nTenma. Air head. ... Lol nothing more XD\nSo, the whole basis of this show is Love (mixed in with alot of puns/jokes/hilarious outcomes and events that pop\n          \n        up along the way). Which makes the whole Love scenario more, well, Loveable XD\nHarima is in love with our air headed main character Tenma. And he decided that he will try his complete best to be with her! He's stopping his delinquentness and going to be a good man too be with her. But wait. Tenma has feelings for someone else!??!?!?? WHOOOOOO!?!??! It's another classmate of theirs! Karasuma!!! Karasuma, an overall random character. Mainly silent. For this character. ACTIONS DO SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS!!! (Just that you're dealing with Tenma (an air head) and Harima (a complete idiot).\nFollow along with this hilarious battle of love. Even the side characters themselves are in a war to find love as well, but have fun and enjoy friendship and whatnot along the way.\nIf you're looking for a great laugh, look no further. This is just a 10! \nYou will be absorbed in it soooo fast, and love every moment. Because in this show. There are no dull moments!!!\nI've watched all the seasons/OVA's , But I really want to get into the manga. For it continues on afterward~ ^_^ I'm happy that it does, and look forward to reading those sometime in the near future~\nLOL. STOP READING NOW AND GO WATCH IT!!! :3\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="                          \n    School Rumble is one of those shows you look at on the shelf in a store and think that can be worth watching then  you get to watch it and realize its really good to watch.\nSo what makes School Rumble good, well it has characters that are like-able and fun to watch that make the comedy factor work very well for the show. The story-line is a simple one which balances out with comedy aspect of the show.\nAlso it seems nearly all the characters have problems when it comes confessing their feeling for those they love  and for Harima this causes some annoyance\n          \n        but fun comedy moments to watch.\nSchool Rumble is a show you can watch again and again and never get really bored of, it shares this quality with shows like Ouran High school host club. Its a show you watch and enjoy without needing to think to much its about fun.\nThis show is one you should all watch if you like it or other shows like Ouran High School Host Club then won't be disappointed.\n        "},

I've seen quite some anime, not like crazy but around 200, and I've only given the perfect score of 10 to:\n Evangelion 2.0, Black Lagoon: Roberta's Blood Trial, Code Geass, Hellsing Ultimate and Fate/Zero... and I even surprised the 1st time I analysed my experience with this series and came out with a score.\nAnd the main reason is that this anime is a comedy/romanceish (more comedy) and I laughed my a** off the whole freaking time, I'm not usually into dumb, random situation kinda comedy, but this shiz made me laugh so\n          \n        hard man.... I recommend it 100% is just FUN, really enjoyable, amazing to spend time and get a smile and get a nice day :)\nGo watch School Rumble NAO!\n        "},
