The heroine of the story. Victorique De Blois has the appearance of a small, almost doll-like, girl with long golden hair and emerald eyes and a voice that sounds exactly like that of an older woman. It is mentioned once that she is 15 years old. Another important part of Victorique's appearance is a pipe that she smokes when thinking about something. She spends her days at the conservatory at the top of the library, reading several difficult books, often in different languages, simultaneously. She points at one wall of the library and has told Kazuya that she has read almost all the books over there. Along with her sharp tongue, abusive bluntness and eccentric attitude, she possesses amazing detective skills.
