			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=1177, ["text"]="\n                          \n    I was incredibly skeptical about Code Geass at first, but I'm very pleased to say that I was greatly surprised.\nSTORY - Before I saw this series, it was described to me on multiple occasions as 'Death Note with mechas.' After seeing it, however, I am inclined to disagree. The similarities between the two series are superficial at best, and though I can see why people would draw the comparison, I don't really think that dis/liking one means that you'll dis/like the other. But anyway, unlike Death Note, I wouldn't say that the story in Code Geass is particularly notable or unique. It's actually rather straightforward\n          \n        and even a little cliche, but that's exactly why this is such a well done series -- the barebones storyline is handled in a refreshing and new way that grabs the viewer's attention. There are enough twists and turns involved to keep you on the edge of your seat. The pacing is excellent and nothing feels rushed or drawn out. Indeed, the progression up to the conclusion is especially brilliant. (It's a cliffhanger 'ending,' but oh, it's just a fantastic cliffhanger.)\nThe series is also appealing in its uncanny ability to mix genres. Yes, this is a mecha series, but it really doesn't have to be. Yes, CLAMP did the character designs and there are some very shoujo elements (read: homolust), but there are very shounen rivalries and some pretty epic battle scenes too. Everybody wins! Additionally, because of the number of characters, the story allows for a number of small subplots. I was very happy with how this was handled in particular because all of the subplots relate and affect the main plot directly, whether by revealing some bit of information to both the characters and the viewer or by pushing forward interesting character development. Everything is well thought out and wonderfully executed, so despite the fact that 'strong-willed person with plans to change the world receives mysterious power that helps facilitate his goals' isn't a very unique storyline... Code Geass makes it work.\nAlso. Code Geass utilizes the 'best friends trying to kill each other' plotline, and I'm a sucker for that plotline.\nCHARACTER - The characters in this series are rather varied. Some are very plain and one-dimensional, while others have an amazing complexity to them that makes them very life-like. I'll be honest. I've become somewhat infatuated with Lelouch as a character (and am rather biased as a result). To me, he is very much a human character -- he has emotions, opinions, a unique point of view, and some very serious flaws, all of which make him incredibly easy to relate to and to sympathize with. He is easily the most complex character in the series, and he feels real to me, even with his supernatural powers and his genius-level intellect. This ability to make the audience relate to him is also probably the series' greatest strength and the main reason why the story is able to remain relevant and interesting despite the fact that there aren't too many new ideas plotwise.\nSuzaku would probably be second in line for complexity after Lelouch, though his sense of justice might be called cliche at first (along with Nunnally's and Euphemia's), and his hax-level physical prowess is somehow harder to accept than Lelouch's genius-level intelligence. It's harder to appreciate Suzaku's depth at first, partially because he is presented as Lelouch's main obstacle and the audience's sympathies are with Lelouch, but a great deal is revealed about his character throughout the course of the series, and he becomes an amazing foil to his rival. Their conflicting ideologies and philosophies are fascinating if you really look into it, and gay as it sounds, they really do compliment each other very well.\nMuch of the rest of the cast seems to fall into typical archetypes -- there's your adorable little sister, your mad scientist and his assistant, your cheerful schoolgirls, your best friend, your most loyal soldier, your second-in-command, your village idiot, your... really creepy lesbian girl? Despite the generic-sounding descriptions, most of the characters are actually pretty fun, or at the very least, interesting. C.C. provides snarky commentary. Shirley spreads innocent schoolgirl love. Nunnally is so moe you'll die. Jeremiah is a good butt of all jokes. Little bits of backstory are tossed in here and there to separate them from the crowd, but it's never enough to actually intrude, and the wide range of characters lets you settle into the world pretty well too; after all, what universe is complete without an animal mascot that shows up now and again?\nARTWORK & ANIMATION - I wasn't too impressed with CLAMP's character designs at first (noodleboys!), but as always seems to be the case, they gradually grew on me, and I remembered just how pretty X was. CLAMP just knows how to make everyone look amazingly sexy, male or female. I really loved how they did all of the facial expressions in the series though, especially for Lelouch. Seriously, that guy had some of the most awesome crazy expressions, some of the most amazingly touching sadface expressions, and of course, some of the most amusing WTF expressions. The mecha designs for the Knightmare Frames were also pretty awesome. I dig the whole rollar blade thing, and some of the technologies they come up with are neat, if a little over-the-top. The animation is fluid and smooth for the most part and very few things stood out as being bad.\nMUSIC - Initially, I wasn't particularly fond of any of the OP/EDs for Code Geass except the first ending by ALI PROJECT because 1) they're awesome, and 2) Yuki Kajiura's style seemed to suit the series very well. The screaming violins both convey the high status of Britannia and the intensity of the emotions in the series. The rest of the themes seemed lackluster in comparison, but though I was never a huge fan of FLOW, 'COLORS' kind of grew on me after a while. The final insert song, 'Innocent Days' by Hitomi is pretty nice as well. Very thoughtful, very poignant, very fitting. The background music during the series was negligible for the most part; there is some pretty generic battle build-up type music and other appropriate, but rather typical, themes. Still, there's some neat classical/opera stuff, and the 'All hail Brittania!' theme is definitely awesome.\nVOICE ACTING - I've seen all of Code Geass subbed and most of it dubbed. Although I was incredibly turned off by Johnny Yong Bosch's role as Lelouch initially, it kind of grew on me, and now I think it fits well enough, though I do wish he'd change his voice a little more when Lelouch is Zero (make it a little deeper?). Suzaku's dub voice surprised me with how appropriate it was too. One of the things I really wish we could replicate in English though, is the subtle differences in manners between characters, between Lelouch and Suzaku at various stages of their lives, and between Lelouch and Zero. In Japanese, when Lelouch and Suzaku are children, they refer to themselves with 'boku' and 'ore' respectively. As teenagers, the pronouns are swapped, with Lelouch using 'ore' (Zero uses 'watashi') and Suzaku using 'boku.' Euphemia uses 'watakushi.' I'll skip the grammar lesson (go wiki 'Japanese pronouns'), but suffice to say that these differences provide a lot of very interesting insight into each of the characters. It's really too bad English isn't nearly as interesting.\nThe rest of the voices in the dub are pretty average, perhaps the low end of average, with a stereotypically high-pitched girly voice for Nunnally that is amazingly annoying, and very forgettable voices for virtually all the female characters (Milly, Shirley, and Kallen all kind of sound the same). I was very impressed with Lloyd's dub voice though, even if nothing will ever amount to his amazing original voice, which is uh, amazing! Seriously. One of the most amusing voices I've ever heard. Jun Fukuyama's voice for Lelouch I found to be a bit too deep/old sounding initially, but that grew on me as well, and I really love the badassity of his voice for Zero. Suzaku's original voice sounds a little generic at first, but it grows with his character. There's a good bit of Engrish in the Japanese version as well, which is always fun. I don't think you can ever get tired of their 'Yes, my lord(o)!' or their 'All hail Britannia!'\nOverall, I'd say the original is damn awesome, and the dub is pretty watchable -- always a plus, right?\nOVERALL - I really love this series, and I definitely did not see that happening. Honestly, I found the first episode incredibly underwhelming: the opening sequence made it look like a series I wouldn't be interested in watching at all, and all of the expository really turned me off...but the second episode? That was so much more epic than I could have ever predicted, and I was pretty much won over after that. I'm just a sucker for chess analogies, I guess! Seriously though, good story, good characters, good animation, and good music! Mechas, politics, rivalry and comradery, strained friendships, love and hate, complex ideologies, and blowing shit up! What more could you want? :D"},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=832, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Code Geass is one of my favorite anime. Why? It's filled with so much action, bombastic dialogue, and has such eye-catching visuals that it tops the charts in entertainment value. This is an exciting and epic anime and it's over the top. \nFor some people, the plot, characters, and music alone is bad enough to make the show unwatchable. For others, the high action, flashy animation, and drama will be more than enough to make the show a favorite of all time though I like everything about Code Geass. \nStory: Lelouch Lamperouge appears to be a typical high school student at Ashford Academy in the\n          \n        Britannian controlled Area 11 (formerly named Japan.) But he's actually a prince in the Britannian imperial family, and seventeenth in line to the throne. He develops a hatred for the emperor of Britannia and the entire imperial establishment, vowing to one day destroy them for the death of his mother and cripple of his sister. After an encounter with a mysterious young woman named C.C., Lelouch gains the power of Geass, which grants him the ability to force anyone to do what he wishes. With this ability, Lelouch becomes a mysterious figure named Zero and begins his battle against the Britannian Empire. \nCode Geass have too many loose and cliff hanging ends. The end are always left unexplained, leaving the viewer with questions not only about various subplots but also about several key elements of the storyline. However, what makes up for this is the plot and character developments. Every episode is surprising and leave you eager to watch the next episode.\nIt seems Code Geass mainly focus on the drama, emotion, and the heart-breaking moments. Geass ends up being not so much a story with a certain plot and characters but rather a series of exciting, exaggerated but well-crafted, incredulous and definitely memorable scenes.\nCharacters:  The characters, are so great and awesome that it's hard to stop enjoying them. There are characters that are a goody too shoe, outright intolerable that will make you want to strangle and kill them off the show. The characters are all so great that something unexpected might happen to them. There are also characters that are naive, filled with too much hate and/or love but in the end, you'll have a character you like or maybe even love. My favorite character, of course, are C.C., Kallen, and Lelouch.\nArt & Animation: Another good thing about Code Geass is its high production values and colorful animation. The character designs, created by CLAMP, are great and well drawn. The animation may not be great but it is detailed, vivid, and lively. The fights aren't as smooth or fluid as it could be but it's flashy, colorful, which is very much fitting considering the nature of the series. \nSound: The voice acting also plays a role in the show's success. Characters like Zero and Suzaku may be outrageous or cliched but their voice actors fit the characters so well that they are able to sell the characters. One of my favorite voice actor, Jun Fukuyama, does a great job playing the key character of Lelouch/Zero. His performance, especially how well he change from the carefree high school student to the more sinister and manipulative rebel is vital to keeping the series enjoyable and entertaining. Fukuyama is usually playing two characters and does it absolutely convincingly. There's nothing to complain about of the music either as the background music is very good and it fits right in it. The openings for Code Geass are my favorite. It's very paced and exciting.\nEnjoyment: I've seen Geass more than 5 times in a row already. (Not counting season 2)  This is a nice, great anime. With the non-stop action, you'll be wanting to see which side will win and lose. For one moment you can be smiling, then crying the next. Happens to me sometimes.\nOverall: Code Geass is a awesome  anime that will surely gather different opinions from viewers and other reviewers other than myself. I've seen and heard a lot of people saying SUNRISE has done an awesome job and it's not because of the use of mecha, action or drama, but rather how effectively it appeals to that certain aspect of anime that is not often addressed and yet is one of the main purposes of anime: entertainment. If your main interest in anime is in the quality of the storytelling or the characters, then Geass is probably not for you. However, if you're in it to have fun or for some good laughs, then take a look at this anime. You wont be disappointed. Indeed Geass is a rare accomplishment.\n        "},
			{["score"]=5, ["helpful"]=722, ["text"]="                          \n    Alright, its taken me since April to reach this point so I may as well dispense with any further delays and say it outright.  Code Geass:  Lelouch of the Rebellion is not a masterpiece, it isn’t a great show nor is it a very good one.  What it is is a marginally good television program that takes concepts and characters from a wide variety of successful anime productions from the last decade and stitches them all together into twenty-five episodes of vulgarity and excess, a Frankenstein’s monster of a production that has the cold manufactured feel of a product of a focus\n          \n        group rather than of a motivated team of creative individuals.\nLet me take a step back for a moment, because the truth of the matter is that Code Geass brought with it a genuinely compelling concept, one that could have done wonders if the creators at Sunrise had known what the hell they were doing.  It takes place in an alternate universe where a version of the British Empire called Britannia, through various quirks of fate, manages to endure and thrive into the 21st century.  After witnessing the assasination of his mother and having his and his sister’s lives ruined by his father, an exiled Britannian prince living under the assumed name Lelouch Lamperouge, out of a desire for revenge against the emperor, rises to become a revolutionary leader in an occupied Japan.\nThis concept could have gone in any number of directions and in the right hands could have been turned into something truly remarkable.  Unfortunately Goro Tanaguchi and his team at Sunrise either didn’t realize the potential of what they’d come up with or were simply too caught up in making a commercially successful product to care.  For, you see, although the basic premise survived to see the light of day it has been chained to and obscured by a wide variety of disparate concepts and ideas, none of which add anything of substance to the proceedings.  This is a program that wants to be a mecha action series at the same time it wants to be a war drama at the same time it wants to be a romance/harem series at the same time it wants to be a high school comedy while above all else its trying to be Death Note with a copy of V for Vendetta in its pocket.  It all gives the impression of a program that’s so terribly frightened of being disliked by any one subset of the anime fandom that it rushes to appeal to every conceivable kind of viewer and as a result is never truly exceptional at any of the things it attempts.\nGiant robots, for example, are thrown in for no better reason than to draw in and satisfy the needs of the giant robot fandom.  I don’t have anything against mecha per se but neither do I have any great love for it leaving me rather indifferent to it overall.  All I ask is that it adds something to the experience, that there is some concrete purpose for their presence motivated by the narrative, that the giant robots aren’t merely props easily interchangeable with any other fantastical weaponry.  Full Metal Panic provides, in its continuity, a fairly detailed justification for how its variation on the giant robot concept came into being.  Patlabor provides a similarly believable rationale as well.  Ride Back would have had a wonderful thematic connection to its motorcycle/robot hybrids had the creators had the sense to utilize a specific scene outside of the end credits.  Code Geass has no such virtue.  The “Knightmare frames” come across as a ploy just as empty and cynical as Gonzo’s additions of giant robots to their adaptations of Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai and Dumas’s The Count of Monte Cristo.\nThe story itself runs into trouble fairly quickly.  In the first episode, Lelouch is inspired to begin his campaign against Britannia when he obtains a supernatural ability called Geass from a mysterious girl wearing a tight-fitting straitjacket.  This ability allows him to control the will and actions of anyone he chooses with very few actual limitations.  All he needs is direct eye contact with his intended victim and that’s it.  By comparison the Death Note has a whole page full of rules and restrictions on its use.  As a result, a lot of Death Note’s intrigue is generated from the various ways Light Yagami finds to work with or around those rules.  The Geass is almost too powerful by comparison.  As a result it makes his decision to start a rebellion in Japan as a means of gaining revenge against his father in Britannia seem a very roundabout way of doing things.  It would seem more effective to simply hop a plane home, Geass his way past security to get to his father and that would be the end of it.  Its not like Lelouch doesn’t accomplish much the same thing with his brother Clovis at the end of the second episode.  Of course, if Lelouch were to actually follow the course simple logic would dictate then he wouldn’t have started his rebellion and Code Geass wouldn’t have had the opportunity to indulge in enough overblown spectacle to shame Michael Bay.\nThis problem is further compounded by the revelation in the second episode that Lelouch is some sort of super-genius strategist.  It’s never explained to any degree where his ability comes from, whether the creators want the viewer to assume that its some sort of blood inherited trait or that he was simply educated on the subject.  The most the viewer is allowed to understand is that Lelouch’s “strategic brilliance” has something to do with the fact that he’s good at chess, which, if you actually accept that, only explains a fraction of the schemes that he devises.  In the end, as a character Lelouch comes across as little more than a plot devise, a strategy generating machine that provides the series with its single greatest source of overblown spectacle.  \nOut of the rest of the cast the only character who made, or I should say had the potential to leave in impression on me was the anti-Britannian rebel Kallen.  She receives an entire episode devoted to her background as the daughter of a Japanese mother and a Britannian father.  Much is made of her identification with the Japanese side of her parentage and how her deceased brother figures into things and there is indeed potential for something interesting here.  Unfortunately nothing is ever done with any of these elements.  Everything that was brought up in that episode is quickly shelved and never brought up again. \nIt should be noted that a good portion of the issues I have with the show stem from the fact that Code Geass possesses all the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the skull.  The result is a heavily calculated experience where the hands of the creators can be clearly seen picking and choosing which ideas or scenarios would have the greatest impact regardless of whether or not they make any sense (coincidences are invoked to the point of absurdity).  The first episode alone depicts an ethnic cleansing (a scenario the series portrays twice in its first season) and a bloody mass suicide sure to satisfy the more ghoulish members of the viewership.  Fanservice is plentiful and obvious with only a scant few female cast members escaping the first season with their dignity, if they ever had any to begin with.  \nOn the technical side of things there isn’t really a whole lot I can complain about.  The animation is smooth well done.  The color scheme employed can be a little too bright and cheery for its own good with purple mechs and a city that is lit with pink lighting at night but that is a minor complaint overall.  Character designs come courtesy of CLAMP so if you like their artwork you’ll like what you see here.  If you don’t like CLAMP then there isn’t anything in Code Geass that will convince you otherwise.  The soundtrack, credited to Hitomi Kuroishi and Kotaro Nakagawa, isn’t anything spectacular but it is nonetheless serviceable.  It is a competent presentation overall, if only.\n        "},
			{["score"]=4, ["helpful"]=317, ["text"]="                          \n    Directed by Goro Taniguchi, arguably one of the best directorial talents left at studio Sunrise, and written by his Planetes screenwriter Ichiro Okouchi, Code Geass promised to be a true epic series in the making. An interesting alternate history, a lead character that promised to evolve into a ruthless rebel seeking revenge against the father and the country that ruined his and his sisters life and a dash of mecha added into the mix for good measure. So why did it turn into such a complete circus? An absolute mess of jumbled ideas never touched upon in any way that isn`t absurd or laughable, a\n          \n        cast of characters who constantly degrade into utter imbeciles and a constantly re-shuffled plot. By the half-way mark of Code Geass, it`s as if focus changed from creating an actually riveting series, to essentially seeing how stupid they could take the whole thing and see how many viewers would go along with the ride.\nStory: While Code Geass had an interesting premise that seemingly got off to a good start, it`s unfortunate the creators of the show had no idea how to handle the mass of ideas they had, or perhaps they simply didn`t care. New plot elements are introduced while at the same time are others are pushed back and delayed, sometimes by many episodes, and sometimes taken out of the show entirely, left to be settled in the 2nd season yet to air. The writing completely flat lines half way through and instead of the gripping and fast paced war/revenge story we had, we then dive headfirst into utterly inane romance drama with a resolution so incredibly bone headed that the series has almost turned into a comedy. As the series moves on, almost as if the romance was a checkbox on a 'to do' list of the plot, the series gradually builds up again, making you think it may yet recover, despite the still omnipresent idiocy, but the show sees fit to deliver a 'plot twist' so completely over the top and ridiculous, the writers have wrecked absolutely everything that the series had built in it`s first half, only to deliver one of the most stupid and pathetic twists in recent years. I can`t imagine the writers had any other intention rather than having the audience laugh at the absurdity of it all. The series seems to want to be so many things at the same time. It wants to be a gripping war story, a drama about revenge, it wants to include romance and tragedy, but without foregoing humour. Unfortuntely it was unable to do any of these right.\nSound: Music wise, the show's soundtrack doesn't impress much if you're familiar with Kotaro Nakagawa. His music here is essentially a rehash of mostly every other show he's done and remixed into one soundtrack. The only stand out area are the vocal tracks by Hitomi and Mikio Sakai, but even those are all too familiar if you're aquainted with their previous works. As far as the OP and EDs go, Colors by FLOW is a great accesible song, and Hitomi no Tsubasa by Access is perfectly catchy in that 'I wouldn't admit in real life that I like this' way. The rest of the shows selections vary from the uninspired (2nd ED), to mind numbingly awful (ED1 and it's usual Ali Project rehash and the often hated OP2).\nCharacter:Just as the plot of the series completely crumbles midway through the series, so do the characters. Completely intolerable and annoying side villains are introduced while other much more interesting ones are left to languich and not to reappear until much later. The constantly annoying Suzaku throughout the show is barely even a character, so much his personality and intentions are a joke. Some characters have their personal development completely eradicated from the series, again only to delay it into a second season, while most are barely given even a cursory look, including even supposedly main antagonists. Worst of all is Lelouch, whose descent into a sort of machiavellian evil was purportedly the series main selling point (Episode 1 'the day the devil was born'), is reduced to an utter half wit, commiting imbecilic mistake after another and constantly proving to be all talk and nothing more. A complete let down in every sense.\nValue: A seemingly promising series that eventually degrades into nothing more than fanservice and idiocy. Whatever points the series seemed to want to make in it`s first half are utterly invalidated by it`s second. The lack of any sort of resolution, for anything in the series is as confusing as it is aggravating. Being made to wait 4 months for a completely lackluster 'ending' only to find out we`ll have to wait even more for any kind of resolution is ridiculous. Knowing that a second season is in the making is irrelevant, there needs to be some kind of payoff for sitting through 25 episodes of this, and all we are left with is having to wait for another 25 episodes.\nEnjoyment: As far as rating this show as an enjoyable new series with promise from a once great director, I`d be hard pressed to give it anymore than a 4. Nevertheless, the shows stupidity and constant excesses at least made it worth watching for a few laughs. Laughing at it of course, not with it. Sunrise seems to be stuck in a rut in terms of how it plans out and executes it`s shows. Mai Hime, Mai Otome, and now Code Geass and unfortunately they don`t seem likely to want to change that formula. I expected much more from the people behind this show, a complete shame.\n        "},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=310, ["text"]="\n                          \n    A new Gundam series is being announced! Naruto: Shippuden is finally beginning! KyoAni is doing something new! RomeoXJuliet!\nThese are titles that attract us to the newest animes, but Code Geass, much like our beloved Suzumiya Haruhi was (and is) a fall/winter sleeper success. This anime, backed by Sunrise, director Goro Taniguchi (s-CRY-ed, Gun X Sword) and scriptwriter Ichiro Okouchi (Azumanga, RahXephon, Eureka 7) showcases an excellent engine of entertainment. \nStory \nA key part of any mecha/action anime. Code Geass is set in an alternate reality in which it appears the American Revolution during the late 1700s was quelled and Britain went on to conquer the\n          \n        rest of the Americas. Thus, the Holy Britannian Empire became the world's largest superpower, covering 1/3 of the world. On August 10th, 2010, a.t.b, Japan is conquered by the Empire, renamed to Area 11 while her people are designated as 'elevens' and have their rights stripped. Thus begins the story of Code Geass, the tale of Lelouch Lamperouge, eleventh prince of the Empire and his ambition to obtain revenge on the Empire through whatever means necessary. Through the use of this alternate reality setting, we're definitely given something out of the ordinary. Code Geass brings a new spice to an old genre. Code Geass hops along with an arc to arc system with a few lighthearted episodes to mix things up. The story builds with each arc (obviously) to the climax. Although the rising action allows for few breaks, the viewer is never overwhelmed with information or under whelmed by a standstill. As each arc progresses to its end, we're given answers to previous questions yet new ones always arrive  -  it's this sense of mystery that really gives Geass its draw for attention.\nPros: Intriguing political, action, dramatic and moral oriented story. The questions never stop  -  the viewer is always left wanting to discover and see more. Light hearted episodes here and there, placed very well (ex..The School Festival).\nCons: A few scenes may turn people off on the series  -  something parts may seem excessively strange (read: some to some people). Again, I'd like to reiterate that for a mecha fan, I'm assuming you'll be watching this for either story or super awesome mecha battles  -  you'll get both from this.\nCharacters \nThe main characters are all extremely well devised by the hands of the all female group, CLAMP. Besides their high aesthetic appearance, each character harbors a separate and distinctive personality essential to the story. For example, Lelouch and Suzaku, opposing main characters and best friends both suffer from a very Machiavellian, ' Do the ends justify the means,' syndrome. Lelouch is willing to do anything to further his goals however Suzaku remains wary of what must be done and what should be done. Code Geass shows us the characters inside the mechs; they're not clean cut: 'I fight to protect someone I care about.' Each character must weigh the morality of their options as influenced by their past where the correct decision may place them farther from their goals. \nPros: Large cast of balanced characters providing a wide arrange of personalities and moral conjectures. Characters are quirky and enjoyable.\nCons: Only the main characters matter; anyone else is pushed to the sidelines (i.e. their stories are never a main focus).\nThe Battles\nCode Geass delivers during its extremely well devised battle scenes. Battles seem as if they were an entirely seperate anime; lines are drawn, ace pilots face off and the battlefield is real. Geass takes a new twist on 'main-characters-destroy-grunts-then-whoever-else-battles' and puts us right in the intensity. As said above, there is a large array of characters, interesting on both the 'good' side and the 'bad' side (which is which is up to you). The battlefield pits them against each other in a deatch match where we know one has to lose yet we are sympathetic to characters on both sides. This sort of conflict draws out the most amazing and interesting battles you can get from a mecha series of this time. Battlefields are led by commanders (obviously) who must make judgements based on his or her opponents's tactics and information - the strategem of battles only adds to the entertainment. The complexity and chaos of a battle give the illusion that you are watching a real war happening right before your eyes.    \nAnimation \nNot much to say here; Sunrise puts money into this, characters look great, mechs look great, everything looks great. However, the art design may put some people off; characters are very tall and lanky (as expected from CLAMP) while grunt mechs are generally unimpressive. Overall though animation is on the high end of the spectrum even during low budget episodes.\nOverall \nCode Geass is probably one of the few mecha anime's that will appeal to more than just action fans. Battles are kept to a minimum: the main attraction consists of Japanese nationalism against foreign invaders, their actions which undoubtedly cause bloodshed in the name of peace. One of the themes I enjoyed was the balance between cause and effect. Characters were constantly victims of their and others' actions this although a given in the real world seems to slip past many other story boards.\n        "},
			{["score"]=5, ["helpful"]=184, ["text"]="                          \n    Yet another review for the highly acclaimed Code Geass. I believe this is the 98th review C.G would’ve received; but I can’t help but review this even if so many others have. \nHow does such a blatant horribly written show gorging with clichés and plotholes ever be compared to the likes of or considered as Death Note’s rival? I suppose it's because both shows were aired at the same time in Japan. I suppose it's because of \"how uncanny\" the resemblance between the two anti-heros are. And I suppose it's because they feature \"the ends justify the means\" views and morals. I started\n          \n        watching because of the many reviews that has praised this and the amount of people who recommended this for people who liked Death Note. And so I watched it. And regrettably so. \nMeet Lelouch Lamperouge. Former prince of the Britannian Empire, previously named “Lelouch Vi Britannia”. He and his younger sister, Nunnally had left the royal family after their mother had been brutally assassinated many years ago and they now live on campus on Ashford Academy, where he also goes to school at. One day, he comes across a beautiful girl named C.C or C2 who gives him the power of Geass which is located in his left eye. His Geass allows him control people and make them do any of his bidding once. He uses this power to crush the Britannian Empire and under the alias “Zero” he leads the Black Knights, a terrorist organisation, and sets out to free the world from Britannia’s clutches.\nI wonder how many clichés we already encountered in that paragraph. We have the “secretly a prince” cliché, the “school environment” cliché, the “mysterious and beautiful girl” cliché and the “revenge on killing my mommy” cliché. And that’s just the beginning.\nThe story is just one big mess. It had more plot holes than the ozone layer. They just keep adding and adding to the plot but do nothing about it. To keep up with the ‘story’ I had to constantly read the episodes summaries in Wikipedia, which I never had to do with any other series. And quite frankly, this has got to be the most boring series ever. I bet if they took out the mecha part of this the show would’ve been a flop. \nCharacters. We have a number of characters in this show, whom are mostly ineffective and does not add to the story whatsoever. Why the need for so many characters? Throughout the whole series I think I remembered 5 characters out of a cast of 50+. The White Knights didn’t do much; neither did the Chinese government and where the hell did that guy who I assume is the glasses-girl-who’s-madly-in-love-with-Princess-Euphemia boyfriend come from?!\nLelouch has got to be the most overrated character ever. We’re told he’s smart but so far all I’ve seen is that he’s good at chess. His strategies are bland and under explained to the point where logic seemed to be extinct when coming up with them, as if he just guesses the next move to take correctly.  And he is the worst anti-hero I’ve come across. The way tactlessly kill innocent humans isn’t justified to well either. It was quite a bore to see him ‘use’ people, but not actually manipulate him; like getting close to them and puppeteer them in such a way that angers the viewer. But instead, the viewer doesn’t feel anger towards Lelouch for being such a bastard prick who play with people because he DOESN’T play with them. The viewer feels nothing: no anger, no sadness nor even excitement as he continues killing people. In other words, he fails at being an anti hero. \nAnother thing. The Geass. He can make any person do his bidding once. And that’s about it. He doesn’t try to find any way around the Geass, how he can use it or anything of that nature. Totally boring. \nNormally having different art styles is one of the plus sides of anime. However, the art in this had me cringing. The characters are disturbingly anorexic, all of them being 6ft tall and 40kg heavy. It was just ridiculous. The noses are undefined and oddly shaped, as for the rest of their sack of bones of a body. The animators weren’t afraid to show scantily clad woman at the drop of a hat either. Ecchi in this show managed to exceed that of a sleazy harem, and fan service covered just about every minute of this anime. \nThe only thing I can salute Code Geass for is the music. They manage to skilfully implement everything from jazz music to marching band trumpets in the show. However the openings were a bit of a let down, with average J-Pop taking the spot. \nOverall I believe this just seems to be an anime where the creators tried to throw in as many clichés as they can possible and tried to make it an intelligent anime but have failed miserably. Have I mentioned how BORED I was from this? I’m surprised how masochistic I’ve become and actually watched 15 episodes of R2 before it became too much and dropped it. \n        "},
			{["score"]=4, ["helpful"]=161, ["text"]="                          \n    Probably one of the most blatantly obvious train-wrecks of bad writing in the history of serial visual narrative production, shamefully destroying its own at first stimulating concept of alternate reality with awful characterizations, extremely weak script and cheap developments that only serve the purpose of working as a 'shock-factor' to keep the audience entranced beyond the notice of a very clear lack of sequential planning.\nHonestly speaking, the show is certainly fun and even held itself within certain quality standard during the irregularly interesting initial 11 episodes but as characters exponentially lose their own minds and personalities we are nothing else but witnesses of the now\n          \n        classical conceptual phrase in entertainment: 'jumping the shark'. By the badly plotted twist in its 'praised by the masses' stage 22 the series barely keeps itself as dirty and trashy fun that that makes you willingly embrace the filth of Japanese animation: the very price of marketing in a ridiculous attempt at dramatic storytelling that takes to oblivion without any justification its own suspension of disbelief. \nThe core problem is, of course, Lelouch. Some may argue it's hard to portray a genius but in the end it's as simple as keeping him from committing underdeveloped mistakes just for the sake of progressing the chronicled history. Not to mention how the rest of cast just acts without any justification whatsoever and never lives up to their indicated development or makes any attempt at decently stopping their inevitable crash into mediocrity. Nevertheless I got to admit that despite her poor dialogs Cornelia remained amazingly likeable, and that must say something about the value hidden in the idea of her original concept.\nAnd so, with the lack of any real literary theme so to speak besides the hilariously exploitative Machiavellian motivation of its ridiculous excuse for a lead, the show honors the words of director Goro Tanigushi and exists as just an excuse to create a 'hit show' to appeal both males and females. He succeeded for sure, shame it was at the cost of all the artistic merits of the finalized production. \n        "},
			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=142, ["text"]="\n                          \n    Code Geass is set in a alternate reality where the Britannian Empire has conquered more than one third of the world and counting, and that includes Japan. In said Japan, now called 'Area 11' - and its inhabitants 'elevens' -, a Britannian student named Lelouch Lamperouge finds himself thrown into a cycle of events that ultimately leads to him gaining a power known as the 'Geass', a power allowing him to force anyone to obey any order he gives to them. Together with his hate for Britannia, he uses his newfound powers to gain followers and eventually bring forth a war against the oppressive Britannian\n          \n        Empire.\nThe story skips along at a fast pace, taking the viewer through one event after another, spending neither too little time nor too much time on each event. And skipping has a more literal meaning here too; the story tends to take small jumps here and there, not explaining the events in between until a bit later. This may come off as a little confusing, but it's also a nice way of keeping you wondering what's going on and what's going to happen next. It doesn't lack twists and turns either, and especially towards the end will you get some unexpected yet pivotal twists.\nOne of the things I love about Code Geass is that it frequently delves into subplots, something which would've normally been bad for a two-season series. However, despite their initial prospects of irrelevancy towards the main story, in the end they serve a purpose in the grand perspective, either by moving the plot forward or by presenting character development. These subplots also help keep the show a refreshing and interesting watch.\nOn top of that there's a lot of ideology in the picture, both on a political and a personal level. The Britannian Empire has their share of - in my opinion - wrong beliefs. The most obvious one is the racism they're displaying towards the inhabitants of the territories Britannia has conquered - or Numbers, as they call them. They also follow social Darwinism, which is basically the principle of natural selection implemented into human society. Stupid beliefs, if you ask me. But not everyone thinks so, it would seem.\nThe more intriguing ideologies are found when we move down to the personal level, though, with Lelouch and Suzaku's differing beliefs being the root of a ideological conflict. While their goals are more or less the same, they differ in their views on which methods should be used to accomplish the goals - Lelouch believes that the end justifies the means no matter what, while Suzaku believes that peace by murder is wrong. This conflict between two best friends (when not in battle) is a really interesting one, because it is so representative of the moral conflict that's presented - who is good, and who is bad? Britannia - or Zero? Decide for yourself who you want to sympathize with.\nMany people have compared Code Geass with Death Note, saying that it is the same, just with mecha. While it is easy to see where that is coming from, it is only on the surface that this is true. Both series' main characters are very intelligent and analytical fellows who believe that the world must be changed through bloodshed, and they both have some supernatural power. But that's all there is to it. Aside that they're as different as day and night. As a character and human being, Lelouch is a thousand times more believable than Light, mostly because he is explored much more than Light is; all we got to see in Death Note was Light's intelligence and analytical capabilities, while in Code Geass we actually get to explore Lelouch as a human, and partake in his emotional experiences, be it love or interaction with his friends, victory or defeat. And aside the two of them, I couldn't really find any similarities between the two shows. Hence, you may like one and not the other, so if you've watched Death Note and did not like it (:o), you may still like Code Geass.\nCode Geass also presents a huge array of supporting characters. Some are more one-dimensional and cliché than others, yet they all have their defined personalities and roles in the story. Some of them are developed in a great way, and come off as believable during their exposition. The subplots mainly focus on them, and either develops the characters or the story, and it's interwoven with the main story in a truly great way.\nCode Geass, both story- and character-wise, builds up more and more towards the end; the impending climax becoming more and more evident after each and every episode. Finally, in the last two episodes, the fuse has run out, and the bomb blows. In the end however, what one will see is the smoke and not the results of the big explosion; you are left with one massive cliffhanger that'll make you long for - no, need to watch the second season.\nCharacter designs are done by CLAMP, and anyone who've watched or read one of their works will know what to expect in this department: Tall and lanky characters. It's a style that may be new and unusual for many, but it really grows on you, and you can't help but think that it looks good enough, even though their proportions are off. The animation isn't anything spectacular in other departments, but it's good. Great special effects and detailed surroundings help on the aesthetic pleasure too, and aesthetics is something which is important to me when I watch an anime. The coloring is fresh and vivid, however often too much so; at times it could've probably gained from having a darker color tone. Nevertheless, it was well done. The action scenes are made out well, with smooth animation and great mecha movement, and just the right effect of chaos that's needed during intense battles. There is some reusing of the 'Geass-effect'; the special effects they use when Lelouch uses the Geass, and while cool the first few times, it gets a bit annoying in its persistence.\nI have to admit, I'm a sucker for the type music they used in Code Geass. Utilizing voices instead of instruments makes for an experience that I just fall completely for, and several insert songs make it even better. Some background themes are reused a lot, but my, are they effectual. The opening and ending themes aren't especially noteworthy, unless you're a fan of the artists performing the songs, that is. The first ending theme is made by Ali Project, and I have to say, I've grown to like their style a lot.\nCode Geass can be summarized to an anime that doesn't produce anything that's over the top or exceptional, but it does give us is one helluva experience with great characters, intriguing ideologies as well as a twisted plotline that ends in a cliffhanger so massive it could kill you!\n        "},

If you have any qualms against it, whether you dislike mecha or anything like that, put it aside and watch a few episodes.

			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=103, ["text"]="\n                          \n    Some people like to attribute Code Geass's success to the fact that it is a Sunrise mecha.  Personally, I'd like to think that it succeeds (critically) despite the fact that it is a Sunrise mecha.  Code Geass manages to establish a believable backdrop from which it launches a compelling plot along with motivated and realistic characters, something that has been missing from the last few Gundam series produced by Sunrise.  It injects a plot where the focus is finally on the characters and the events surrounding them, rather than the machines that they use to fight.  In fact, it could be\n          \n        said that Code Geass only qualifies as a mecha anime due to the existence of the machines - they are in no way integral to the plot nor its development anymore than a tank or any other weapon that the characters may be using (aside from the mysterious 'Geass' itself).\nGeass's plot is strengthened by its attention to detail in the geopolitical climate that the series quickly establishes from the get-go.  While the setting isn't too unique for a futuristic mecha (world divided between multiple superpowers, belligerent native populations fight to reestablish their cultural identity, etc.), the way the events are interwoven with one another sets itself up as being above the status quo.  Code Geass also manages to ask some of the questions that other futuristic plots seemingly neglect, either through purposeful avoidance or just through sheer ignorance.  From a political / sociological perspective, the setting and the development are especially engaging, posing questions on the topics of nationalism, racism, genocide, and the rules of war to the audience.  While you shouldn't expect any profoundly new ideas to arise from the series, the fact that the writers and creators did weave these ideas into the ongoing plot makes the world both more realistic as well as more theoretical at the same time, providing both an environment for the characters to exist in as well a philosophical establishment that they can debate.  \nHowever, the writers do not merely craft a beautiful world and leave it alone - instead, they focus much of their attentions, especially in the latter half of the season, towards physically and metaphysically deconstructing the world, both in the direct, tangible actions of the characters as well as the moral questions surrounding their resolve and trains of thought.  Such is the development of the actual plot of Code Geass: fluid, dynamic, and engaging.  While not entirely unpredictable, the plot's development is seamless in terms of being able to logically move from one event to another, such that the implications of a 'cause and effect' paradigm can be observed.  At the same time, the plot is also not so simplistic as to be a 'Point A -> Point B -> Point C' formula.  Instead, we witness the joining and interweaving of multiple, distinct plot lines, which at first glance are independent of one another, but towards the end fuse into one.  Then, Code Geass throws us a curveball, and splits the strands again, preparing us for the upcoming Season 2....\nThe greatest relative strength of Code Geass when compared to most other action / mecha anime are its characters and the way they develop.  Sunrise made the intelligent decision of contracting CLAMP to design the characters, since they are both visually and emotionally appealing to a wide array of audiences.  Internet messageboards are usually torn between the main protagonists and side characters of the story, each holding one above the others for a personal reason that they see within each one of them.  In addition, the side characters are not there merely for ornamentation - even the seemingly minor characters at the sides of the main few are given room to develop with their own storylines and reactions, such that we are never really compelled to dismiss characters as merely being 'filler fodder'.  Prepare to be intrigued by these individuals - from the psychological coldness of Lelouch, to the restrained idealism of Suzaku and Kallen, to the overall question mark that is C.C.  The reactions of the individuals combine to form distinct, evolving psychological profiles, allowing the series to be populated by a cadre of multifaceted individuals.\nWhile Code Geass is extremely successful from a storytelling perspective, it does have its faults, especially on the technical side.  Plain and simple, the fight scenes were not too impressive.  That is not to say that they were awful, but the mecha and battle scenes definitely did not compare tot he fluidity of the script nor the depth of the characterization.  In addition, especially towards the latter third of the season, the plot does take a few freedoms with regards to suspension of disbelief, as well as falling into the trap of rapidly switching between 'tragically dramatic' to 'comically relieving' scenes.  However, these are minor problems, especially the 'bloated plotlines', which fixes itself by the end of the series.  I also would not recommend this series to mecha addicts who are genuinely more interested in awesome combat scenes between mechas, since Code Geass will not live up to your expectations.  However, for the rest of you, even if you have never considered picking up a mecha anime to watch, pick up Code Geass, it is sure to not disappoint.\n        "},

			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=65, ["text"]="                          \n    Code Geass is one of those series that can inspire praise, hatred or mere ridicule, depending on what is expected or what can be tolerated. Curiously, I find entirely valid reasons behind each of those reactions. There's still a bit of this and that, to put it bluntly, but perhaps the lines aren't quite as clear as they seem.\nIn short, I enjoyed the series and still find that its virtues and sheer fun factor outweigh its objective flaws, but I'm worried about the future. Whether or not the inevitable sequel picks up the slack, addresses existing concerns or drops the ball completely is something that\n          \n        only Sunrise knows at this point. In any case, we might as well enjoy what we can.\nStory: \nThe premise is melodramatic and ambitious enough. Lelouch, the protagonist, is embarking on a personal quest through the use of his intellect and a mysterious power, motivated by personal revenge and morally ambiguous altruism. The setting is divided into two spheres, the edgier world of military/politics and the more carefree environment of the Ashford academy, with their respective casts of characters. There's a clear element of mecha action here as well, even if it's not really the main attraction and doesn't dominate the show.\nThe pace is definitely fast and unrelenting...perhaps it's all a bit much for Lelouch's and the story's own good, though, as things turn out. The writing and direction can be uneven during the weaker moments, but are absolutely thrilling at their best. Most of it develops quite nicely, with some general predictability and a few genuine surprises that keep things interesting. \nThe biggest concerns are certain major twists which threaten to overwhelm the viewer, if they are not enjoyed or understood. Intentional and unintentional humor, such as Pizza Hut's sponsorship or many over the top sequences, can be occasionally distracting as well. I personally felt that the basic focus is never lost, however, when all is said and done, in spite of a few undeniable blunders or red herrings.\nIn the end, we've only seen half the story and, for better or for worse, the upcoming sequel has the responsibility of providing true resolution. Or at least trying to do so in an interesting way, whether it fails or succeeds at it.\nAnimation:\nProduction values are good and tend to stay consistent. I've never been a CLAMP fan, mostly due to unfamiliarity, so their original character designs for Code Geass -while distinctive and attractive- don't really impress me too much. They may also look strange from certain angles. The mechanical designs are just fine for the show's purposes, with a couple of particularly well done models. \nSound:\nThe music is appropriate and mostly unobtrusive, whether the mood is serious, exciting, relaxed, mischievous, dramatic or tragic. Not exactly the best soundtrack I've ever heard, as a few tracks could use more variety. The opening and ending themes are quite well done, as a rule, and tend to fit the show. Naturally, your mileage may vary here.\nCharacter:\nFor someone who is often accused of being a copycat there are certain nuances to Lelouch's personality that set him apart, such as his emotional range and a sense of humanity emerging from his internal conflicts or character flaws. Predictably, the protagonist himself carries the show on his back and receives the most development, which is good since he does deserve much of it and this makes him an interesting subject of study. Having said that, said development has at least one major drawback: it may not be what people are expecting and finding certain events relatively disappointing or even anti-climatic is quite possible. Suzaku, who also plays an important role as Lelouch's foil, has a self-righteous personality and his interference can be very annoying to witness. He does have some complexity though, even if it's still a hard sell for those who find themselves sympathizing with Lelouch/Zero. C.C. herself is mysterious enough, as we've only seen bits and pieces of information regarding her background thus far, but remains an intriguing and generally fun character by virtue of her interactions with Lelouch. \nSecondary characters tend to get some attention too, with interesting results in the major cases whether you appreciate their fates or not. The big issue for me is that the cast of characters might seem a bit too large as the show goes on, with a couple of unnecessary additions towards the later half that tend to delay, limit or rush development. Still, this is the kind of show where such size makes sense on paper given its scope, but as a result we will have to wait for the sequel in order to see if a few questionable plot threads are continued, resolved or at least replaced.\nEnjoyment:\nThe first season of Code Geass, even though I wasn't entirely convinced about certain plot twists and openly laughed along with certain sequences or developments, was certainly entertaining and rarely boring. \nIn short, I appreciated both the genuinely well-done portions and several of the more absurd scenarios. The show is not a masterpiece by any means, nor is it going to please every sector of the audience that it will initially attract. I'd still be perfectly happy to recommend it to those who haven't seen it.\n        "},
			{["score"]=5, ["helpful"]=52, ["text"]="                          \n    The most succinct way to describe Code Geass is to call it a cross between Death Note and MEGAS XLR/Gurren Lagann with a generous helping of your average ecchi harem SOL romantic comedy and a dash of Evangelion thrown into the mix. Does it work? Not exactly. Code Geass is one of those shows that brings a lot of good stuff to the table but fucks it up in so many ways once the script comes into question. There are more plot holes here than there are potholes on the Grand Central Parkway, and whether or not that's hyperbole is entirely up for you to\n          \n        decide. Despite all of this, I'd like to make it perfectly clear that I actually DO happen to like and enjoy both seasons of Code Geass to the point where I would actually go out of my way to have both seasons on DVD or Blu-ray (provided that Funimation actually gives it a release any time soon >_>). With that said, my enjoyment can only go so far.\nLet's just start off with what REALLY gets my goat with this show because there's a lot of that stuff that just doesn't sit right with me one way or another. First up, there's the character designs. Believe it or not, the character designs were the very reason why I never bothered watching Code Geass when it was on [adult swim] way back in 2008/2009. Whilst I do happen to like CLAMP's mangas (i.e. X/1999, Chobits), it's their artwork that just doesn't sit right with me. Why am I mentioning this? Well... CLAMP was contracted to do the original character designs for Code Geass and nothing more. I don't know about you, but I'm not too fond of lanky pretty boys with long arms and big eyes, girls with small waists and melons that realistically should make them collapse under their weight, etc. I'm more of a fan of Naoki Urasawa or Inio Asano's artwork than I am CLAMP's from a character design standpoint. Thankfully, not every character on the show is drawn like such (i.e. Charles zi Britannia), but our boys Lelouch and Suzaku are and we see more of them than we see Charles so... yeah. Why can't we have humans that look like regular humans? I don't fucking know, but it is what it is.\nThat brings me to another problem I have: fan service. As much as I love my lascivious animated women, the fan service in Code Geass got to a point where I was wondering if I was watching Rosario Vampire again. Any time that there was a serious moment going on where shit was about to go down, in pops Shirley changing into her swimsuit or a shot of Kallen's ass, or Kallen entering a conference room in a bath towel because she wanted to yell at Lelouch, or some other bullshit like that. Yeah... I'm not a huge fan of the girls in this show barring C.C., Cornelia, Euphemia, and a couple of others if only because of the fact that virtually every girl in this show is no better than a fan service character. Would you believe me if I told you the fan service got to a point where there was an out-of-place masturbation scene? Well, there is. When did this show turn into End of Evangelion? I don't know, but that's another story.\nGoing off on a tangent, another problem that Code Geass has is the fact that it just loves to jump between all that plot-heavy rebellion stuff with light-hearted slice-of-life school stuff and let's just say that in between the fan service and this crap, I had a hard time deciding which was a bigger buzzkill. As stupid as the actual plot of the show got at some points, it certainly managed to keep me engrossed until the episode ends, I load up the next episode, and I see Suzaku and Lelouch chasing a cat for 20 minutes. I'm not even joking, that was actually the plot for an entire episode. You know, it's moments like these that make me see why the uber elitists here on MAL tout Legend of the Galactic Heroes as a superior alternative to Code Geass. At least that show managed to maintain a consistent tone throughout the entire narrative. Of course, there are a lot of reasons why LOGH isn't high on my priority list, but let's not get into that.\nOn the subject of writing, Code Geass has some of the most glaring plot holes that I've ever come across. It took me a while to actually pick up on them since I was too caught up in my own enjoyment to actually bother analysing the show crtically but when you actually use your critical faculties whilst watching this show, you start seeing more and more stuff to use as snark bait. For example, Lelouch's \"Geass\" power is so unbelievably broken (broken as in \"overpowered,\" mind you). He can only issue a command once to any individual, but that command is absolute. Basically, Lelouch has the ability to turn anyone into his slave if he so chooses. Sure, there are some arbitrary rules thrown into the mix as a half-hearted attempt to balance out his powers but really... you have to wonder why Lelouch didn't just order a whole bunch of people to be his slaves until he did something else.\nOn the subject of Geass, the way it's handled is just so bizarre. Geass is supposed to be absolute, but shit like sheer willpower and even a kiss from a sexy green-haired chick can override its influence on you depending on what the episode demands (that last one is not a joke; that's how the R2 actually gets going). At one point in R2, there's a \"Geass Canceller\" introduced but it's only given to a character who seems to suffer from a severe case of multiple personality disorder and he only bothers using it whenever he wants to. Now, Geass users are prone to having their powers go rogue and this actually does happen to Lelouch at some point. However, this plot point was quickly dealt with and we never hear from it again. Even if you factor in all the other Geass users, the entire conflict surrounding Code Geass feels meaningless at some points. The entire show could've been condensed to 12-15 episodes had Lelouch actually made better use of his powers and there was less bullshit along the way. Alack, that's another story of what could've been.\nSpeaking of Lelouch, the characters here in Code Geass are so variable in terms of quality. Motivations change at the drop of a hat, characters that were once likeable become complete assholes, and even at that point, the writing behind the bulk of these characters just isn't good most of the time. Let's just say this: Lelouch may very well be a genius, but the anime certainly doesn't do a good job of showing any sort of actual intelligence on his part. In fact, Lelouch may very well be the predecessor of Kirito when it comes down to how perfect he apparently is (right down to the harem of girls waiting to drop their panties and bend over; thankfully, Lelouch has no time for these hoes).\nThe only indicator we actually have for him being a genius is the fact that he's a chess master and that he somehow has the gift of clairvoyance. Any time some major shit's about to go down, he's able to predict certain events with such a remarkable degree of accuracy to the point where you gotta wonder if Charles and Marianne had Lelouch while a voodoo witch doctor was delivering him. Now, despite his genius status and how he's able to weasel himself out of almost any situation, the guys at Sunrise decided to not make him 100% perfect. He gets cocky and because of this, he makes some REALLY stupid decisions over the course of the show. He ALWAYS ends up letting his emotions get the better of him in battle whenever shit doesn't pan out the way he wants to, he kills off potential allies whilst sparing enemies, and he gets caught up in completely unnecessary battles because of his apparent lack of foresight. Seriously, this guy doesn't seem to understand what back-up plans are and the only reason why he ever makes it out in the first place is because of some \"ingenuity\" on the battlefield.\nNow with Lelouch's failings out of the way, let's talk about Suzaku. A lot of people hate him, but I don't. In fact, I'm rather fond of him at some points if only because of his relationship with Lelouch. What I don't particularly like is the fact that Suzaku is apparently trying to change the system from the inside but he ends up becoming a rank-and-file soldier who effectively slaughters his own people despite the fact that he wants to save them. Question: if he really wants to change the system from the inside, why doesn't he become a politician? Okay, maybe there's some kind of Britannian law that prevents Japanese people from getting into politics but the fact still remains that he's so stupid to the point where he fails to realise that he's NOT helping his own people by becoming a person who's contractually obligated to slaughter the Japanese for whatever reason. People rag on him for his idealistic views, but there are a lot of great characters who have idealistic views on whatever (i.e. Kenzo Tenma from Monster) so that alone isn't enough to make him a bad character. If you really want to give him shit, bitch about how he's incapable of realising that he's NOT helping his own cause whatsoever.\nThe other characters aren't exactly much to speak of either... at least, in a positive manner. For one thing, there's Nina Einstein... and let's just say that I can't wait to read a fan fiction where she dies a mercilessly brutal death. She has to be one of the most irritating and infuriating characters out there, and she's the one who's responsible for that out-of-place masturbation scene. We have Kallen, whose potential is overshadowed by the size of those melons and that ass of hers. We have C.C. who's quite a hilarious snarker but she's not really good for anything except plot conveniences, fan service, and Pizza Hut product placement. We have Nunnally, an irritating paraplegic who has no use outside of being a damsel-in-distress with a brother complex. There's also a pot-pourri of other characters but I'm not about to waste more of our time talking about them.\nFor all the shit I've said about Code Geass in general, the first season on its own was quite entertaining (provided that you don't think too much and just let your inner filthy casual run wild), and it did manage to do some stuff right. For starters, the dynamic between Lelouch, Suzaku, et al was quite lovely and if anything, it's that very relationship that made the ending to the first season that much more intense. The second season on the other hand takes everything I didn't like about the first season and then dials that shit up to 11. We have MORE unlikeable characters (lookin at you, Rolo!), MORE inconsistent characterisation, and MORE disjointed storytelling with all the plot holes you've come to know and love. Oh, and let's not forget the fan service! You know how much I love seeing Kallen's knockers or that sweet ass of hers.\nHonestly, the second season is a HUGE drop in quality compared to the first one. Now despite all of that shit I said before, what I really hated about the second season was just how slow it actually was. Say what you will about the first season, but at least it felt like shit was actually progressing from point A to point B. I'm not even joking when I say that I came close to dropping the second season twice because I was so bloody bored out of my mind. Was there stuff happening? Well, yeah but nothing of consequence actually occurs until the final ~6-7 episodes of the season. As strange as it sounds, the second season actually did get off to something of a decent start and it was obvious as to where it wanted to go with the story but it just took so fucking long for ANYTHING of substance to happen. What happened in the meantime you ask? Mecha battles for the sake of having mecha battles, plot twists that would only make sense to someone who's hogging the blunt for too long, and character interactions that just make you wonder if this really was the same show as the first season.\nAmazingly enough though, people seem to give this season a pass purely because of that ending. I'm not gonna lie, Code Geass has one of the most intense and ultimately satisfying conclusions of anything I've ever watched. However, that alone isn't enough to excuse all of the bullshit that went on in this season. Yeah, the second season doesn't have as much slice-of-life bullshit as the first season but R2 made up for that deficiency with all of this bad writing. For starters, characterisation is worse here, and I don't even think Sunrise was trying to hide it anymore. For example, we have Lelouch who HATES Rolo because he's not Nunnally and he intends to use Rolo and then kill him once he's outlived his usefulness. However, Rolo ends up kicking the bucket at some point and then apparently, Lelouch loved him like a brother all along even though there was no such interaction that went down between the two which would imply anything of the sort. Suzaku on the other hand ends up doing a complete 180 on his original characterisation. Remember that idealistic idiot who didn't realise he was killing his own people by being a rank-and-file soldier instead of becoming an idealistic politician trying to change the system from within? Well he was all like \"fuck that shit\" and only cares about the end result rather than the means used to achieve them. On the one hand, at least he acknowledges that he was being an idiot but on the other hand, that gets rid of the one trait of his I actually liked.\nGoing back to the plot twists, they just really got stupid after a while. I mean, the first season was flawed to high heaven but the plot twists still managed to get me on the edge of my seat until the mood was killed by Bulma, wait I mean Kallen. For example, we find out that Marianne (Lelouch's mother) didn't really die but she was alive all along. Right before she was about to die, she somehow developed a Geass that allowed her to transfer her soul into another body. I'm not making a single word of that up. Can you smell the contrivance anywhere in this whatsoever? Let's not forget how Charles apparently sent Lelouch and Nunnally so that they'd be safe or some bullshit like that (even fans of Code Geass can see the plot holes in this one) or how despite being a racist and cold-hearted jackass for 90% of the show's run, Charles was actually a good guy the entire time. Yeah, I don't buy a single lick of any of this. Oh, and that's not even getting into how Lelouch could apparently control GOD of all things with the sheer power of his own Geass.\nYeah, this show is amazing, right? It's so brilliantly written, so gripping and enthralling and it's a master of manipulating your emotions whilst keeping you on the edge of your seat for more! The characters are the best of their kind, and I wait for the day when common literature could even hope to push out characters as brilliant as Lelouch, Suzaku, and Rolo. Oh God, I couldn't type any of of that with a straight face. From a critical standpoint, Code Geass is BAD. There's no two ways around it, it's a bad series in general. This show really knows how to keep it real, real stupid that is. You know what though? All of this stuff combined isn't enough to dampen my enjoyment whatsoever. I mean, for all that Code Geass got wrong, it must've done *something* right along the way. How else could it have gotten so popular in the first place? A lot of the reasons why I enjoy this show are superficial in the first place. The mecha battles were enthralling (by my standards, anyway), Lelouch's hammy behaviour kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the dubbing across both the English and Japanese tracks was absolutely spectacular.\nMake no mistake: if you try to take this show seriously, you *will* hate it. The biggest reason why so many people adore Code Geass in the first place is because of the so-called \"rule of cool.\" Code Geass is one of those shows that just oozes awesomeness (well, by my standards anyway) and at some points, it had me cheering on all of the senseless stupidity just like I do whenever I'm watching Gurren Lagann (yeah, it really does get THAT dumb at some points). Code Geass is the functional equivalent of a Michael Bay movie in anime, except it actually gets some more stuff right that Michael Bay would otherwise get wrong. For one thing, it's actually entertaining to watch for a good ~65% of its run as opposed to the gut-wrenchingly appalling pacing that usually makes his movies painful to watch after the first hour (I'm looking at you, Age of Extinction!). Hell, even if you don't find this show cool in the slightest, you'd definitely have a fun time snarking at how stupid it gets. It would be hard NOT to find a reason to enjoy this programme to some marginal degree.\nNow where does this leave Code Geass? Well, I'm painfully aware of its shortcomings but that doesn't stop me from enjoying it. For what it's worth, Code Geass isn't a show that's average in the slightest. If it can evoke all kinds of of reactions out of people, it would only make sense for anyone to give this show a shot and see what they'd get out of it. Besides, it's good popcorn material if you're in the mood for something stupid that you can watch with friends while eating pizza. I mean, the uber elitists and hipsters here on MAL would beg to differ but this show ISN'T the worst thing to come out of humanity. That, my friends would be Kodomo no Jikan but that's another review for a different day. Anyway, that's all for now. Feedback is always welcome and with that, I'm out. Peace :)\n        "},

Code Geass is neither of this. \nI started Code Geass as soon as the first episode aired.. Yes, I have enjoyed it very much. But to my surprise, on the arrival of the 13th episode, Code Geass took the anime industry by storm. Like a moth to a flame, people crowded the anime and simply worshiped it(God knows how many CC fans are being born as of this moment). Much as Ive enjoyed Code Geass, it does not do justice to be considered what it is today. In\n          \n        fact I feel its popularity is similar to FMA, both are highly enjoyable but nowhere near being the masterpiece people claim it to be.\nCode Geass is not a sight to behold, but rather a sight to gather thousands of fans within only barely dozen of episodes. Spectacle, after all, is Code Geass specialty, not subtlety, so enjoying the sum of the parts sometimes requires dispassionate detachment or at least blind belief. But whether you think Code Geass is absurd or lacking originality, Code Geass is one of the most fun and engaging anime's in recent memory, as long as you don't think about it too hard.\nJapan, being defeated by the empire of Britannia, whose territory reaches nearly one third of the world thanks to their high-tech war machines called Knightmares, was renamed to Area 11. Britannia swiftly depraved the Elevens(Japanese) of their pride, rights and isolated them from the migrating citizens of Britannia, leaving them to poverty.\nThis is where our main boy steps in. Lelouch, a young former prince of Britannia who was known to have passed away, not to mention a cheap ripoff of Light Yagami from Death Note.  During a battle between the Britanna and a scarce amount of rebelling Elevens, Lelouch finds a capsule containing a naked woman, who gives Lelouch Geass, a mysterious ability that can control any human simply by looking them in the eyes and speaking his commands. And because that it just so happens that Lelouch has this great animosity for the Brittania, he plans to single handedly face the tyrant. \nLelouch under the alias of Zero, becomes a hope to the elevens and a threat to Britannia.\nIts hard not to compare Lelouch from Yagami Light of Death Note. But if you can get past it, you'll find out something more. Coming with a tragic past pre-installed, it may seem that Lelouch is your typical apprehended teenager(Gundam anyone?). But Lelouch in a way, is a revenge-driven genius who would dare to go against the world to reach his goals and doesnt endlessly desires to just die without a fight.  He even has the discernment for seizing control of the situation and directs the terrorist group by radio, controlling them and anticipating the moves of the Britannian forces like it was a game of chess.\nIt isnt entirely plausible how is still able to manage a double life and lead the Japanese to victory. But it does provide Lelouch moments to look more sympathetic and less unrealistic.\nSo yeah thats pretty much what you need to know. Lelouch battles Britannia with the help of the ever so gullible and disposable Japanese. Oh and I forgot to mention Suzaku,an Eleven who is his childhood friend, siding to Britannia. They both basically the want the same thing, only they have different methods. Lelouch wants to rid of Britannia to make the world easier for his sister to live in, Nunally. Suzaku, on the other hand, wants to climb the ladders of Britannia, and gradually change it to good from the inside. \nThere's a ton going on in these first five episodes, and the pacing is rapid-fire.  Add in a truly epic stage, some awesome battles, and just a dash of comedy to keep things from getting too dark, and it's really hard to see where this show can go wrong from here. \nCode Geass is majestic, in terms of entertaining. The plot twists are so twisted that it becomes endless and absurd. Every episode ends in marvelous cliffhangers that can make you get a garotte wire and strangle yourself for an entire week until the next episode comes out and makes you do the same thing all over again. It just keeps getting better and better.\nThe actions are also a treat. From assault to massive warfare, Code Geass is impressively detailed. The contest between Britannia and the Eleven are as breathtaking as they are thrilling, while the individual battles are supremely well choreographed.\nCode Geass has so many things working in its favor that it becomes easy to overlook some of its flaws.\nThe animation is completely convincing and fulfills the shows 'mecha plausibility' quotient well besides than the roller blading war machines. Moreover, few if any prior shows have as effectively integrated the tacky yet refined movements of the robots as they do here. CLAMP did the designs here so be sure to expect it to be excellent(and have arms, which have uncanny ability to stretch an extra three feet)\nThe music is fluid. It always depicts the sound perfectly. Be it a gunshot or a whole building crumbling down, it is nicely executed. The background effects are also a plus. You get to hear a bunch of insects flying around or birds chirping.\nIt gives a rather credible atmosphere partnered by a perfect atmospheric melody. The clarity of the sound effects definitely supports the anime very well.\nVoice acting is no slouch either. It can easily persuade you of the emotion of each characters tries to convey, even supporting characters are given enough to time to emote.\nThe results are predictably impressive, even genre-defining. However as good as Code Geass is in terms of spectacle, the show does hit a few dud notes in terms of plot and characterization. But put together with visual flair, it's a winning combination that helps to ensure Code Geass is a roller coaster experience of thrilling intensity.\nJust like Da Vinci Code, it is 'preposterously entertaining'.It is safe to say that anyone who's interested in action or mecha will go bananas over Code Geass.\n        "},
			{["score"]=4, ["helpful"]=55, ["text"]="                          \n    (this review will cover elements from R2 and R1)\nThere will probably be a large amount of people who will look at the score I gave code geass and click the \"not helpful\" button without even bothering to read the first few lines of this review. If this is you, I don't believe you should bother reading this review in the first place, since your mind is obviously not going to be changed. And also, this review is all my own opinion, the large majority of you will probably enjoy code geass a lot, but if you want to hear a different opinion then go ahead\n          \n        and read the review. \nIntelligent anime. Its probably one of my favourite types of anime. It's so much nicer to get enthralled, shocked, and mindblown by an anime rather than to turn your brain off and enjoy a bunch of generic bullshit that basically copies every other mildly successful show in its genre. Unfortunately however, for every actually intelligent anime there is an equal number of, if not even more shows for which their intelligence is only superficial. While you may not (and probably won't) agree, I believe code geass is one of these shows. \nWhen I first heard of code geass, it was described to me as \"death note with mechs\". Although the manga was a lot better, I actually enjoyed death note, and I dove into code geass hoping for another helping of interesting characters, and a relatively well paced and clever plot. For me, code geass was just a huge load of cliches, underdeveloped characters, and extremely convenient coincidences all wrapped up together to make a quite lackluster anime. Although I'm not going to go over every single little thing, since that would take forever and I'm too lazy, code geass had almost as may plot holes as mirai nikki (although that also has a mean score over 8, so that shows you something)\nIt's very surprising how people try to compare lelouch and Light, or the strategic planning that both shows supposedly have. While they were often unrealistic and sometimes made no sense, the plans in death note obviously had a lot of though put into them, and the dialogue passing between Light and L was interesting enough to keep you engrossed in the story. However, all that the so called \"strategy\" in code geass equates to is \"My mech is bigger and more badass than yours.\" the large majority of battles the black knights face in this anime are won by lelouch procuring a new bigger and more powerful weapon that they use to eliminate the opposition. And when he actually does any real planning it's consisted of lelouch conveniently guessing the opponents next moves as if he's some kind of psychic. As the show goes on he seems to putt less and less logic into his plans. Especially the way they escaped the britannian empire by all dressing up as zero. That was less like a carefully derived strategy and more like something and more like a retarded idea lelouch came up with after he'd had one too many beers. If the britannians honestly couldn't come up with a way to thwart that, then it's no surprise they got outsmarted.\nAnother annoying Element of code geass is the characters. Unless its a show with an above average amount of episodes, or one that is not character driven, good shows often take the route of keeping the cast of characters smaller, and developing those characters further. However, code geass prefers to go to down the path of piling on so many new and completely useless characters that don't garner the slightest bit of interest from the viewer or develop the plot in any reasonable way that you forget the name of anyone who's not a main character. The white knights did fuck all, in fact you only knew the names of a few of them, and this was true for a large amount of the cast. a result of this many of the characters got so little development and focus that I couldn't care less what happened to them at all. Even lelouch who is the main character gets stuck with a cliched \"mah parent(s) were killed omg so sad and compelling\" backstory, and thats it.\nAs for the art, all of the characters look like lanky anorexic beat sprouts who need to go and eat some big macs, but apart from that it was nothing special, and typical for an anime of its time. The sound quality was actually quite good during the actual episodes, however the openings and endings were just boring J-pop that I skipped every time I watched an episode.\nAnother thing I'd like to mention is the fanservice, and this was definitely a lot more prominent in R2. Kallen in her knightmare shot from very suspicious camera angles, Kallen in the shower, and Kallen and CC doing a variety of other things to please the otakus and their penises. It's disheartening that even a so called intelligent anime like code geass ended up throwing in enough fanservice to make an ecchi harem anime jealous. It may have had plot, but it was hard to notice it with kallen's ass getting shoved in your face for half of every episode.\nHowever, as the series does not drop below a four, it must have its good points. Despite him being a lot less intelligent than people make him out to be, lelouch was at some points relatively interesting to watch, unlike all the other characters. And although I found the majority of all the episodes boring, the final few episodes of each season piqued my interest a bit (Dat spinzaku), and I didn't mind watching them, although R2s ending is a bit overrated.\nOverall, I though that although it had its moments, code geass was overall overrated and slightly below average. although some people reading this will understand what I'm going on about, the majority of people who have seen code geass enjoyed it a lot, and the chances are that you will too. However, I personally would not recommend code geass, and I think there are much better anime you could spend your time watching. For alternate recommendations, if you haven't already seen death note (which is unlikely) go and watch it, or for another mech anime try neon genesis evangelion."},
			{["score"]=6, ["helpful"]=55, ["text"]="                          \n    There are 95 existing reviews for this over-hyped anime so I don't really expect this review to be long lived and I'm quite happy that it will vanish into nothingness in 24 hours at the most.\nI just need to vent some opinions I have about this anime. Did I mention it is over-hyped? Even for fanboys of this anime it must be over-hyped. With a fairly good story it tries to become a mecha version of Death Note and I suppose it succeeds to some extent, but not in a very intriguing manner really. The story has many twists and turns and it is quite\n          \n        entertaining at times, but the story can't save this anime from its characters.\nEvery single character of this anime is bad, not even Lelouch is any good most of the time. Mostly because he's so overplayed. However Lelouch is nothing compared to Kurkrurururugi Suzaku. I was on the verge of dropping this anime at each and ever episode, even while watching the very last episode, because of Kurukgukgururui Suzaku, he was not fabulous to say the least. Apart from these two characters the rest of them were no catches either, I don't really feel like going through a list of bad characters so I'm just going to generalize and say they were the usual generic stereotypical blobs on screen fresh from the \"generic steretypical anime character factory\" that they copy and paste into their storyboard.\nDid you notice the CLAMP influences? Of course you did, I don't have anything against CLAMP, they've done XXXholic, but really? CLAMP in a shounen? No.\nIn conclusion this animes screenplay is an abomination, which leaves character interaction between the incredibly boring characters wanting in such a terrible manner that it drags this entire anime down.\n        "},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=55, ["text"]="\n                          \n    At first when i heard of how great Geass was and then I learned it was a mecha show, I was a bit reluctant to watch it since I am not a big fan of mecha. But once I sat down and watched code geass I was really impressed at how good it was.\nStory: The story of this anime is one of the best I've seen and it is highly enjoyable. At the end of every episode I had the urge to quickly watch the next because of how incredible this show was giving you all this conflict and plot twists at would just leave\n          \n        you shocked. I could feel the intensity of the situations at times and not many shows can do that. Another plus is that it was not 100% mecha and it has its elements of mystery in it because of the actual geass power. And the story is not yet over since they give you an ending that just breaks your heart knowing that you're gonna have to wait a couple months to figure out what happened. Cliffhangers are EVIL!!!\nArt: CLAMP, not everyone likes their style of drawing but in my case I am a nut for CLAMP so I found this show's animation really good. The colours were so bright and pretty for an anime that IMO is rather dark and serious. All the robots looks great and have flashy and pretty designs to them, the Lancelot looks SO COOL XD\nSound: The only thing that I didnt find outstanding about the show was the music, some of the background songs I kinda disliked since it seemed like it wasnt really fit for the moment. But overall it was still good. I guess I should comment at how great Lelouch's seiyuu did a great job playing him.\nCharacter: Lelouch is probably one of the main reasons I like Geass, the conflicts he suffers and how he plays some of the other characters is just awesome. Suzaku on the other hand, I dont really like how he is trying to achieve his plans and should just die v_v but thats what makes geass good since it allows me to really get attached to the characters and grow to love or HATE them. Oh and C.C = win.\nEnjoyment: I have really enjoyed watching Geass it has given me one of the best storytelling and even some really cool action as well. And with the new season coming my excitement has once again returned.\nOverall Geass is one of the best mecha shows out there and if you are a mecha fan this show has a lot of other aspects that will definitely draw you in. This is one of the best shows out there and should not be missed by anyone. In my case, I'm just glad season 2 is coming out soon.\n        "},
			{["score"]=7, ["helpful"]=42, ["text"]="                          \n    \"I was dead until the moment I met you. I was a powerless corpse pretending to be alive. Living without power, without the ability to change my course, was bound to a slow death.\" -Lelouch Lamperouge\nPreface: \nI've been debating a review of Code Geass for a while now, and I was really unsure of where to start, given how expansive the story is, and how immense the cast of characters is coupled with everything that I have to say about it. So, that said, this will be a two part review, one for Code Geass part one, and one for R2. \n\nOverview: \nLet me first\n          \n        dispel the dismissive \"Code Geass is just Death Note with mechas\" saying: It's totally different. Similarities can be drawn between tons of shows in which supernatural powers are bestowed upon the main characters, along with their aspirations of changing the world. It's a sleight against this show to say that it's just a rip of Death Note, when in fact, they actually premiered the same season. \nCode Geass is set very straight up- You've got Lelouch Lamperouge, an exiled member of the royal family of Britannia, out for revenge against his father, Charles, the Emperor of Britannia. Britannia being the greatest military power and empire since the days of Alexander the Great, Lelouch is powerless to take action against this seemingly insurmountable enemy, until a mysterious benefactor, a girl named C2, bestows the \"Power of the King\", otherwise known as Geass upon him, giving him the ability to finally wreak the vengeance he so desperately seeks. His power is one that enables him to give someone he can make eye contact with a single command that they must obey. With this, he's out to change the world.\n\nQuick stuff first:\nArt: 7 (5 Animation, 2 Character design)\nCLAMP character design, and everything that comes along with it: skeletal bodied characters with enormous eyes and a lot of wild hair designs, but not Yugioh or anything. Sunrise did quite a good job animating this show, though. Juicy explosions, fluid fight scenes, and solid key frames. Character design consistency is very high quality throughout, with no loss of detail at any time. \nThe mechas look great, and while many designs are reused for the no-name mechs, the named ones are pure awesome, very unique, and memorable.\nSound: 9 (7 for Voice Acting, 2 for OP and ED)\nA lot of people really seem to hate the 2nd OP by Jinn, Kaidoku Funou, but I thought it was appropriately energetic for the rising action. The 1st OP and both ED are fine, nothing really interesting, but not worth skipping. \nVoice acting is on another level in this show: Johnny Yong Bosch leads an all star cast, with names like Yuri Lowenthal as Suzaku Kururugi, Michelle Ruff as Euphemia, Liam O’Brien as the mad scientist Lloyd Asplund, Crispin Freeman as Jeremiah \"Orange Boy\", the great Megan Hollingshead as Viletta, and the Major herself, Mary Elizabeth McGlynn as Cornelia, and others. \nProps to Funimation for putting this incredible group of VA together. They really made the show.\n\nCharacters: 7\nStory: 8 \nIt's difficult to encompass and accurately describe the collective of characters in an ensemble show like Code Geass. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood has a comparably large cast, who are also very intricately worked into the plot. So many characters make an impact that it'd be impossible to list all of their complex interactions with one another and on the plot itself in this review, so instead of Kicking Logic to the Curb and Doing the Impossible, I'm going to stick with the mains. \nTo best understand the characters, we need to first examine their dynamic. Our setup is as described above, a classic revenge tale, Son vs the Father. Lelouch, exiled after the death of his mother, Marianne, at the hands of Charles, flees and lives in secret among the once proud, now subjugated Japanese people, known as \"Elevens\". He and his younger sister Nunnally, who was crippled and blinded after the attack on their mother, are taken in by the family of Suzaku Kururugi, the best friend and ideological opposite of Lelouch. \nYears later, Lelouch, in his guise as a bored high school student, gets wrapped up in a terrorist group operating in Area 11, known as the Black Knights, plot to steal a secret weapon away from Britannia. A series of mishaps later, and Lelouch finds out that the weapon is not inanimate, but a green haired, straightjacket wearing witch named C2. Lelouch sets her free, and she grants him a power, the power of Geass- the absolute control of another being, with the rules outlined above. \nThe dynamic between Lelouch and Suzaku is definitely the most interesting. As previously stated, they form not just a symbolic Friend/Brother against each other dynamic, but also one of an Anti Hero, Anti Villain. Both make some seriously morally ambiguous choices, both have their tortured past, struggles in the present, but most importantly; their goal for the future. This is what drives their ideological differences.\n\"A victory won through detestable means is no victory at all\" - Suzaku in a nutshell.\n Suzaku is a hound of the military. He believes that change brought on by violence and conquest is wrong, and that the racist and oppressive Britannian government should be changed from within, his eventual goal to rise to a position of high military power and use it to influence the outcome of the future. Suzaku's strengths lie in his unwavering loyalty to his ideals, and his almost stupidly overpowered/unparalleled strength in combat, particularly that in mechs.\n-- (interesting, in that he starts out as a common footsoldier, and is rescued by Lloyd to be a test subject for an experimental mech, which then turns his complete ignorance of mechs into a godly fighting machine. We'll chalk it up to untapped natural talent.)\nSuzaku has a tendency to blindly follow his orders, believing it's for the good of his goals, and by proxy, the Japanese- so long as they're at least partly in line with his thoughts. He takes part in many questionable operations, and begins to have self doubt, which really shows the inner conflict in the character. Outwardly, he's always the knight of justice, but inwardly, he has his own darkness, and doubts about whether what he's doing is right or wrong.\nSuzaku is easy to hate at the beginning, for being so foolhardy and unflinchingly loyal, uncompromising. However, he shows a true hero's arc, and improves vastly in R2.\n\"A life that lives without doing anything is the same as a slow death.\"\nLelouch, on the other hand; new powers in hand (eye) is finally equipped to fulfill his dual goals of revenge against his father and his idea of world peace, so that Nunnally can live in a kinder, gentler world. Where they differ is in the methodology. Lelouch plays at rebellion like a game of chess, (symbolism intact). The very image of Zero is that of the king piece in chess, (C2's uniform in R2 is also the image of the queen) and while not the strongest piece, is definitely the most important. Lelouch knows his limitations; namely the physical, and fighting hand to hand. He knows that his intellect and Geass power are his best means of fighting, and uses them to set up and manipulate everyone around him, much to the chagrin of Suzaku. \nLelouch may use manipulation, murder, and other detestable methods to achieve his goals, but he's the absolute definition of the Anti Hero. Noble goals taking ambiguously evil or callous means of fulfillment. Despite his cold, calculating Zero personality, or his ever scheming \"normal\" identity, Lelouch has nothing if not a noble goal in mind- everything he's done, his Raison D'etre is his sister, Nunnally. His life is unimportant in the face of making the world a place that his sister can live in without constant fear for her life. \nNow, the antagonistic relationship that Lelouch and Suzaku share is as thusly: they serve as foils to each other, the White Knight with the dark past, and the Black King who looks to a bright future. An eternal struggle of brother against brother, friend against friend, and an intense underlying conflict of ideals vs the facade of an outwardly friendly relationship. Cat and Mouse, but who's which?\nThe many other characters in the show form a true ensemble, as I said. Screen time is split up very appropriately between the many different threads of the story, keeping parts in suspense when necessary, and most importantly: keeping all the different plotlines up to date where you're not constantly having to keep up with \"What year is this?\" \"Is this the past or present?” For as many subplots as are going on screen in a single episode, Code Geass manages to stay on top of them, keep them relevant, and important to the outcome of the story. The supporting cast has as many scenes as many \"main\" characters from other, lesser shows. They get their fair share of the time, and the story never felt weaker for it. \n*Spoilers from here on*\nEnjoyment: 6\nCode Geass is a very watchable and engaging series, for the most part. It is one of those stories though, that ends up being a jack of all trades and a master of none with how it tries to fit in a lot of themes, with some success and some failure. What I did not like about Code Geass was namely three things: inner universe inconsistency (which I'll get into), tonal inconsistency, and lastly, the fanservice. \nCode Geass has a great setup for a gripping plot, and a lot of fodder to work with. It takes its time explaining many concepts, and never felt rushed, at all. However, there are some obvious filler episodes (giant pizza anyone?) and some plotholes (some of which are patched up in R2, but that has no bearing here.)\n1. Inner Universe Inconsistency\n--The Geass power is explained to have these rules: \nA) Can only be used once\nB) Eye contact required\nC) Person having Geass used on them will perform *to the best of their abilities/physical capabilities the command issued**\nD) The order will be carried out as long as dictated\nE) The subject loses all memory of actions carried out under the effects of Geass\nFinally, F) No one can resist his command, but someone can resist Geass by sheer force of will... (When convenient to the plot)\nR2 aside, Rule A stands. Rules B and D are also always true. The issues arise with rules C, E and F.\nThe writers played fast and loose with the rules of Geass, bending it to their will when they've written themselves into a corner. Geass comes across as Deus ex Machina in many moments in the first series, and while a cool power, it's sometimes cheapened by its misuse or obvious \"why didn't you just use Geass to do 'x'?\"\n2. Tonal Inconsistency\n--All throughout Code Geass, we're treated to a lot of different themes and ideologies. This often comes out as a mish mash of conflicting ideas at inopportune moments. There will be a dark war drama going on, with characters dealing with loss of life, regret, ambivalence about the choices they made and how it affects the future, from victorious highs to the crushing blows of defeat, it swings appropriately. However, interspersed with this gritty narrative will be scenes (or entire episodes) of light hearted comedy bordering on a slice of life tangent. We just went from watching people get brutally mowed down by the hundreds to some schoolkids at a festival with a giant pizza mishap. Alternate comedy with some fanservice moments (Kallen, Viletta) and it really breaks up the pacing and more importantly, atmosphere of the show.\n3. Fanservice\n--Plain and simple, they really beat you over the head with Kallen and Viletta's bodies. Compromising situations, poses, and just really sexually suggestive scenes. I felt they were very unnecessary in an otherwise very serious drama because they didn't add anything to the plot; detracted from it, minorly, because it was harder to take it seriously when they arose during tense and dramatic moments. \n\nOverall: 7\nCode Geass was both a real joy and really infuriating to watch. Chalk that up to how it was written, maybe, but overall it's a \"good\" show. This season really amounts to a 10.5 hour long exposition and setup for R2, the more emotionally charged, and consequence-filled half of what's a really great story.\n+Great MC\n+Good supporting cast\n+Very entertaining, keeps you guessing\n+Voice Cast is among the best\n+Great Anti hero/ Anti villain dynamic\n+Detestable villains\n+/- couple of filler episodes\n- Plot holes (some are not apparent until R2)\n- Annoying side characters\n- Unnecessary fanservice\n- Tonal inconsistency\n- Inner universe inconsistency\nRecommend? \nYes, I would recommend Code Geass. R2 is by far the stronger part, but part 1 is very enjoyable on its own, and necessary to the overarching story."},
			{["score"]=7, ["helpful"]=44, ["text"]="                          \n    Code Geass is definitely a very popular anime, no denying that, but I wouldn't exactly call it a master piece, but it is however, a fun and entertaining show, you just don't need to put too much thought into it.\nSTORY: Once upon a time, there was a famous animation company that decided to mash up as many genres as they can to make an anime that would try to appeal to as many anime fans as possible.\nThe end result was Code Geass, and it was a success, popularity wise.\nBut before I get on to the actual review I have to say honestly, I really like\n          \n        this anime, but it can pretty much ruin the fun of the anime if you try to look at it objectively, but that being said, it's hard not to since this anime tries way too hard to appeal to too many genres that fans are into.\nAdmittedly, the story itself is quite interesting, an alternate reality where England, now named Brittania, has taken over the world and just really hates Japan to the point of ethnic cleansing (It's a little unsettling to say the least). But the main focus of the anime is about a royal family member castaway, Lelouch Lamperouge, trying to get revenge on his father, the leader/king of Brittania for the murder of his mother. So yeah, essentially the story is just another revenge story, nothing too original (How are revenge stories so damn popular I will never know).\nBut the anime starts to show its short comings, and really early on. The anime tries to make you assume that Lelouch is a genius solely upon him being good at chess, with no other reason, he's genius cause he's a beast at chess, that's it.\nThere's no character build up to show he's a genius other than playing chess (But I would not know since I don't play chess, maybe it really does make you a genius, maybe I need to try it out before making this judgement).\nAnd besides being a genius, he receives a power which allows him to control people's minds, once per person, called Geass (Get it? Because the show is also called Code \"Geass\"), which by the way, is the best used character/plot device in the anime, and it's entertaining how Lelouch uses it in dangerous situations or when he's trying to outsmart his foes.\nHowever, the way he obtains just seems that not enough thought was put into it, in other words, kinda lazy, he meets a girl in a strait jacket being chased by the military, and bam! Mind control powers.\nThis is also where you also should realize a major plot hole in the early episodes, with his mind controlling powers, he could get his revenge in a heart beat, but that's not fun to watch at all, but if he could simply kill off one of his family members easily in less than three episodes (Don'y worry, that character's death is just another way to advance the plot), what's keeping him from getting his father like that too?\nAdditionally, Lelouch isn't really a likable character (His comes off being arrogant and is just a calculating and sadistic bastard), but the rest of the cast though, have a little more going on for them.\nThe benefactor of Lelouch's power, C.C. (Pronounced C2) may not be terribly interesting herself, but like myself, she's just there to watch the whole show play out and snack on pizza (Fun fact, this anime was endorsed/sponsored  by a pizza company). \nIn fact I would've been fine if her character just died on the first episode (Spoiler: she gets shot in the head), it would've been more interesting to see Lelouch figure his powers all on his own anyway. But apparently, she must have been a favorite of the creators of the anime, enough so they keep her to mess a round with Lelouch and eat pizza, so at least she's amusing.\nChildhood friend and some what frienemy of Lelouch, Suzaku, is arguably a better protagonist than Lelouch and was developed into his character much better than Lelouch too, but his focus on what he wants to do isn't exactly clear (I want to save Japan/I want to be a knight for britiania, blah, blah, blah), and though his character development is better than what Lelouch's was, it can be arguably be called lazy, because most of it was through flashbacks to his past, though later episodes are more enjoyable due a girlfriend he gets.\nBut, the real stars of the anime are the genres that are ungracefully crammed together.\nIt tries to be school life anime, a harem, an action anime, ecchi anime, psychological anime (TRIES to, it isn't), romance anime, and a mecha anime all at the same time, but if you look down at the core of this anime and try to piece it together, you'll realize it's a gigantic mess.\nEspecially how this anime tries to integrate mecha (Get it? Because it's called Code Geas... wait, don't the majority of mecha anime have the name of a mecha in it's title? Gurren Lagann or any Gundam for example) into the story, they're just literally there to just be cool and to be used as weapons of war, nothing more, absolutely nothing more. Shallow is a better word to describe it than lazy.\nThe anime would honestly be just as effective without the mechs (Apparently the creators are aware of this because two of the manga series have no mechas in them), in fact, it isn't a mecha anime.\nA mecha anime is a mecha cause one of it's major focuses is on it's robots, Code Geass focuses on anything else but the mechas, they're there just to appeal to mecha fans, so really there's no point what so ever for the mechas to even exist in this anime, they're just cool to throw in because they're giant robots.\nBut, there is one thing this anime knows what it is, a loud cluster f**k of many gernres, and despite that it's not a great anime, it's fun to watch and at least pretend that it knows what it's trying to be.\nANIMATION: For me, this is best part of the whole anime, it looks great, the girls are hot, the boys are pretty, everyone wins, plenty of eye candy for all.\nEspecially for fans of clamp, who were generous enough to do the character designs.\nThe mechas look cool enough, but the stupidest parts on them are the wheels slapped on them, they look so ridiculous. But the action scenes more than compensate for them.\nBut other than that, this a gorgeous looking show.\nSOUND: Both the Japanese and English voices are great, but I only watched the english dubbed due to my own preferences.\nJohnny Young Bosch, Yuri Lowenthal, Michelle Ruff, Steven Blum, Kate Higgins, and so many more top notch notable voice actors are in this anime, but of all of them, Johnny is damn good as Lelouch and Yuri's Suzaku is a great compliment to Johnny's performance.\nEach theme music is enjoyable and what you'll except for a mainstream anime, though the back ground music doesn't really stand out.\nOVERALL:\nThe Good:\n+ Very entertaining and fun to watch.\n+ Good looking characters designed by Clamp, and great animation overall.\n+ Good english dub, Johnny Bosch's Lelouch is arguably one of his best performances.\nThe Bad:\n- Can be faulted for trying too hard to appeal to multiple audiences by shallowly cramming genres together.\n- There's honestly there's no point of the mechas other than to be used as weapons to fight.\n- Weak character development, C.C. honestly feels thrown in.\n- Lots of plot holes\nDespite what I have said in this review I would still recommend this to any one.\nAnd I'm surprised I didn't reference Death Note once in this review... Wait a minute... Damn, so close.\n        "},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=42, ["text"]="\n                          \n    The other reviews available here cover a lot of details, so this will be a somewhat brief overview that will concentrate only on the main aspects, without spoilers.\nCode Geass is a good anime that I recommend to watch. However, it has its hits and misses.\nStory\nCompared to many other anime items I've watch, Code Geass's plot twists and unfolds with shocking pace compared to the usually expected sluggishness found in most 20+ episode series. The 25 episodes of the first season would have been enough to supply like 75 episodes One Piece style (no offense to OP: I like it no less than Code Geass).\nThis, however,\n          \n        placed its toll on the story's coherence. Near the end, it might even become somewhat confusing, as if the authors looked at all the possible outcome scenarios and picked the most shocking ones, without paying much attention to how well they would fit. I can't confidently say if its a good or a bad thing, I guess we'll only know for sure after season 2. So far, I'd easily give it a 10 for pace and courage in plot twisting, but after seeing it all I think I'll place some penalty to emphasize that the story could use some more work when it comes to adequacy.\nArt\nI'll be honest: I don't like CLAMP's character design, not even one bit. I'd prefer any Satoshi Kon's or Katsuhiro Otomo's movie characters to it any day. I like the characters to look realistic, and here I see typical bishounen boys and comparably cute girls. No wait, boys are apparently more cute here. Much so. Cause all of them look like, you know, androgynes. And size differences between, say, Lelouch's frame and Emperor's frame are shocking.\nI'm actually surprised how can these boys even move so fast with those frail limbs.\nAnimation is very good, though, action scenes are fluid and detailed. Also, lots of blood, many deaths. Be aware.\nSound\nMusic is fast and catchy, very fitting for a story like this. I didn't like it much, though, except for the second opening starting midway through the series. Rest of the sound work is fine, if you don't count somewhat annoying voices and public domain samples used in several scenes.\nCharacters\nTough to say. On one hand, characters are active and vivid. On another, they can annoy you easily (easily!). Some characters could use more development, some abandoned their development whatsoever. Some you will wish didn't die, some you will definitely wish to have died.\nWhat definitely contributes to my own displease is that the characters are very easy to make a decision no matter how major and complicated the matter is, which makes their actions seem less natural and more 'eh, they totally saw that coming' throughout. Moreover, while many of the main characters' motives are deep and somewhat disturbing, all their thoughts are immediately relevaled, leaving less to think through and analyze, which makes it easier to understand than something like Evangelion, but at the same time detracts from long term enjoyability. There is little point in solving riddles when you're given an answer before you even have a chance to realize that.\nAlso, it looks like the entire cast of main and supporting characters was composed of Mensa members. You'll see what I mean when you watch it.\nEnjoyment\nOne undisputable factor such fast paced story usually contributes to is the thrill. That's right, Code Geass is thrilling, interesting and unpredictable, with numerous comedy elements, little fan service and fascinating action scenes. Just what I like in series like this. A well deserved 10 from me.\nOverall\nCode Geass is an enjoyable watch, clever and surprising. However, its story leaves something to be desired, in both possible senses.\nAlso, don't watch the Recaps together with the main episodes: they disrupt the pace without contributing any new content. Better use them instead of rewatching in case you want to refresh the memories of the events happened. Specials (the non-animated shorts) can be watched at any time, provided you won't watch them before the corresponding events in the main series.\n        "},

			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=41, ["text"]="                          \n    Death Note meets Gundam Wing. Nonetheless, the fusion between the two animes can only underestimate the greatness that is Code Geass. Yes, this series is jammed-packed with attractive characters, battle scenes, bloodshed, slight romance, and even a little supernatural dose to add to a stereotypical anime. However, Code Geass - Lelouch of the Rebellion is not as stereotypical as it may seemed at first glance.\n~[S T O R Y]~ [9]\nInitially, I became attracted to the series through the hyperactive fandom that has spread vastly throughout the world of the internet. Only then did I realize that I could not longer resist watching this show. Indeed,\n          \n        I had my doubts that it would've been a lame rip off of Death Note meets Gundam Wing. Little did I know how wrong I was. A conspiracy between governments, rebellion and anarchy, advanced technology that may be deemed impossible to ever exist in our world, the raw emotion that bounces from one character to another, a small dosage of supernaturality that does little to ruin the storyplot...Code Geass has done well. Breathtaking twists are evident in the series to an extent where the viewer can be grateful that no supernatural assistance was needed. The story flowed as smooth as water. There was not one moment where I felt bored or even regretted watching the series. Even the use of chess metaphors and mythological analogies made the storyplot more interesting. Indeed the show was nothing but a game. Everyone was played. The characters, the world...even the viewers' minds were played! But that was what made Code Geass interesting. It kept us guessing on purpose, like we were part of the game all along!\n~[A R T]~ [8]\nThe reason why I did not give the Art section the same mark as the other categories was the opening theme. It literally used the same animation profusely except it just switched the order of clips around. Every other manga at least alters the opening theme thoroughly until it does not meet its previous ones. But the opening theme appeared as though it were low-budget, like the creators were procrastinating on changing the opening theme a few times and decided to alter it a little by adding in new clips which introduced new characters we would be acquainted with later on in the series. Other than that, everything else about the art was quite intriguing. The paintings in the museum were a little ostentious but in a nice, presentable manner. The essence of CLAMP was illuminated in the character designs, but it did not change the great appeal of each character's personality. The emotions expressed were drawn well. You could taste the insanity radiating off of Nina's face and the hatred off of Suzaku's face. Well done indeed.\n~[S O U N D]~ [9]\nThe scores for the anime's soundtrack was fitting for every scene. We could slight feel the suspense, the nostalgia, and even the burning hatred through the music selected on different scenes of the show. The action sounds were not cheesy. The dramatic sounds were ones to not laugh at. Truly the musical scores lived up to the rank I have given them.\n~[C H A R A C T E R]~ [9]\nIt's understandable how attractive protagonists would surely attract more fans. But I did not fall under Lelouch's apparent spell. Yet I can say that I was bewitched by his hunger for superiority, not to mention locked in the mystery of his past and his intentions. A young, masked vigilante holding the fate of Britannia and Japan in the palm of his hand? It may sound overrated, but his techniques cannot be explained in words. All of the characters left my mind boggled: how do they feel about this situation? what are they going to do? Throughout the series, it felt as though I was able to understand every character and his or her motive. Furthermore, the dramatic scenes displaying the raw emotion reciprocated between different characters was surely not ones to miss. The development was beautifully done. At times even a viewer can sense the vulnerability, the cravings, the sorrow, and the power to know and conquer in each and every character. I applaud with joy.\n~[E N J O Y M E N T  &  O V E R A L L]~ [9]\nThis series should not be underestimated. Do not judge a book by its cover here. The only way an anime like this could be altered is through the observation of biased fandoms. Before reading reviews or hearing the opinions of others, be sure to examine the series first before considering anything else. For I assure you reader that, unless you prefer some ecchi delight or dull storylines, you won't be disappointed. This series teaches a valuable lesson: that we live to fight for something, and how we fight gives everyone around us a sense of who we are. So be careful what you fight for, for you will be one's hero and another's enemy. :]\n        "},
			{["score"]=7, ["helpful"]=41, ["text"]="                          \n    STORY: Code Geass is a story about just/unjust war, the aftermath, peace, and pride. There is great content here with multiple levels of conflict, making the process of deciding right and wrong very difficult. The plot lines are complex, easily drawing the viewer into this fictional world. While the story is not tangibly realistic, the show is quite convincing and alluring. With Code Geass the plot material is serious and demanding. Silliness, fun times, and character development are required and acceptable as long as they remain within the established context. At times the story-telling of Code Geass steps out of its theme, and the flow\n          \n        of the solid story loses impetus and direction in uncharacteristic light-heartedness. The show is then thrust back to its original course which can be jarring. The negative effects of this shift result in a loss of the strong conviction by which the show is driven. Also, this series is not finished, and the end is a huge slam on the brakes. I do not consider the abrupt and unsatisfying conclusion to the 25 episode season to be detrimental, but the end will leave you craving more. Besides the occasional sharp, awkward shift in the plot dialect, the story of Code Geass is fantastic and one of the best of the 2006-2007 season.\nART: Sunrise is one the oldest and most reputable animation production companies in Japan, and they have no problems upholding their reputation with Code Geass. Although it's not the best I've ever seen, the animation is very good. At no point is the art direction bad or frown worthy. Mecha fights are convincing enough, dramatic scenes are illustrated well with emotion in mind, and filler scenes don't fall below the established visual standard. The animation is very good, but, more importantly, the animation is consistently good.\nSOUND: The voice acting is okay. Some of the voice actors blew me away, especially Suzaku's. Some of the actors left me feeling a little soapy with opera, especially Leuloch's. At times important lines, ones meant to finish a powerful scene with conviction, fall short of their mark. However, the voice acting is situational. Sometimes Leuloch's voice actor convinced me to the fullest. At other times the voice actor made me roll my eyes and laugh.  The sound effects are decent, and the music is good at getting the audience interested. However, the soundtrack here does not take command of the epic saga, and there are no moments where the music capitalizes on a scene. The audio aspect of Code Geass is sometimes hit or miss, and the audio is always runner-up to the other facets of the show.\nCHARACTER: There are tons of characters in Code Geass, and the show does an exceptional job of trying to involve each and every one of them. Even among the farfetched fantasy of the show, the characters felt unnervingly human and real. Amongst the diverse multitude of characters, there are complex characters being developed through genuine, deep emotions. And then there are the characters who are well developed but not deep. These characters seem out of place like infants among giants. Whenever these normal characters are on screen, the show drops the ball and begins to feel out of place. The screen time was a little too divided between the true characters and the cookie cutter characters. The true characters of the show sold the story and are arguably the strongest element of the show. I just wish they received more time and focus.\nENJOYMENT: Code Geass is compelling, complex, and convicting, and the final product leaves your heart pounding with tension and suspense. While the experience is very entertaining and enjoyable, Code Geass is dark. As the characters make decisions with massive consequences, the vast amount of emotional weight of the show can easily affect the viewer. The show is fun to watch and equally difficult to watch. As previously stated in the story section, the show does not do a good job of providing light-heartedness and release from the stress. Thus, the peaceful and happy scenes feel forced and out of place at times. Still, Code Geass is entertaining and involving.\nOVERALL: Code Geass is an intelligent and provocative, war-time, think piece. The production has flaws but is still great, and the final product is much greater than the show's parts.\nI hope this review has been beneficial. All feedback, critiques, and comments are appreciated and well accepted through messages. Happy anime watching!\n        "},
			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=14, ["text"]="                          \n    It was the year 2011 of the normal century. I decided to return to the anime medium after a 2-year break from anime due to me being more interested in video games. I went on the Internet, went on google and typed in best anime of all time on the Google search bar. Then I click on a couple of websites and I saw the anime series called Code Geass as it was placed 1st in many best anime lists. Then decided to check to see if it does deserve that spot of best anime of all time.\nSo I watched the whole series of Code\n          \n        Geass on some random streaming website for that weekend and I absolutely loved. I loved it so much its literately became my favorite anime series of all time for a good 5 years.\nFast forward to the year 2016 of the normal century where I became a more experienced anime fan who has seen over 800 anime as well buying anime on DVD/Blu-Ray because I wanted to support the anime industry.\nIt was during that same time where Code Geass would be receiving a follow-up squeal to Code Geass R2 called Code Geass Lelouch of the resurrection.\nNow quickly fast forward to early 2017 where I decided to re-watch both seasons of Code Geass for that weekend and well.\nDoes Code Geass still hold up well after these years?\nFor this review, I will be reviewing Code Geass R1 and my R2 will be reviewed at a later date.\nHello, everyone, this is Shawn aka KurataTrigger and welcome to my review of Code Geass Lelouch of the Rebellion Season 1 (Code Geass R1) and with that out of the way, let's started.\n\nStory.\nSo the story of Code Geass is set in an alternate history country area 11 formal known as Japan before getting beaten in a war on the hands of the Holy Britannia Empire.\nOur main character Lelouch was once a prince before the assassination of his mother as well being disowned by his father left him and sister going into hiding as a Britannia school somewhere in area 11 with his blinded sister Nunally. \nLelouch pilots his revenge towards the Britannia Empire but everything changes during a chance encounter with terrorists where is given the power of Geass by meeting a strange girl named C.C. The power of the Geass enables Lelouch to give a single command to anyone and they must obey him. It's during its time Lelouch reunites with his childhood friend Suzaku Kururugi the son of the former Prime Minister of Japan. Now Lelouch must learn his Geass power to carry out his plan of destroying Britannia as he becomes a notorious terrorist known as Zero as well making a terrorist group called the Black Knight who is a group of terrorists who are fighting for the independence of the country so they fight against Britannia forces.\n\nThe story for Code Geass is pretty good for the most part.\nFor starters, I really like how Code Geass R1 is paced. It's fast and very engaging.\nThe worldbuilding in Code Geass R1 is very good as it manages to showcase how people are living in war Circumstances in both sides as well as labeling nations as well as distant names to relevant locations in the story.\nAlso, I liked the overall story direction for the most part as its very entertaining to watch as well has had great moments.\nCode Geass does a great job at cliff-hangers has it keeps the audience interested of the show\nHowever, Code Geass is not the best-written show in the world. In fact, Code Geass R1 has some notable flaws in the story department. \nOne. Tone consistently\nThe tone of Code Geass can be quite an inconstancy at times especially the middle portion of the show. \nTwo. The school episodes.\nThey could have been better written because those episodes feel very cheesy and out of tone not to mention the pacing for those episodes were not that great.\nThree. Plotholes.\nCode Geass is notorious for its amount plotholes and while the plotholes in R1 is not as bad as it squeal. There were some plotholes in R1 that kinda annoyed me.\nWhy did Lelouch let Villetta live past the second episode?\nHow did Lelouch’s phone have Euphemia number even though Lelouch was Euphy enemy? \nHow did Lelouch manage to plot the other mech perfectly? We never saw him read the menu at all.\nBelieve me however the plotholes in R1 are tamed compare to the plot holes of its squeal.\nThe last issue that I had with is episode 22 especially the second half of it.\nI won't mention it here due to spoiler reasons but my god was the moment terribly directed.\nBesides these flaws, the story for Code Geass is pretty good for what it is.\n7/10\nCharacters.\nThe characters in Code Geass are hit or miss depending on your tastes.\nFor me, I personally enjoyed most of the characters for what they were.\nLelouch, in my opinion, is one of the best main protagonists I have seen in any anime. He the type of character that you can relate to in a very good way. Not to mention Lelouch has great character development and we do get to see that character development as the series progresses as learns more about that Geass as well as doing cruel but justifiable things towards other people.\nWhile am not a fan of Suaku I still found him to an interesting character to watch and he was still a pretty enjoyable character at times despite him being hypocritical at times.\nC.C is another interesting character that is enjoyable to watch. She starts off emotionless but as the show progresses she begins to have show more emotions as well as caring more for Lelouch.\nI really like Kallen as a character. She's a beautiful badass fighter for the black knights.\nShe also develops quite a bit as a character as the show progresses during a certain character arc in R1. \n\nThe rest of the characters of Code Geass are also a hit or miss.\nThis can be very polarizing cast for some.\nFor me, I liked most of the characters because there fun and very interesting.\nFor example, I liked characters like Cornelia, Lloyd, Jeremiah, Euphemia, and Milly because I found them to be interesting and very enjoyable\nOh the other I found characters such as Shirley, Nina, and Mao to be very annoying and they actually hurt the show quite a bit\n8.5/10\nVisuals.\nCode Geass Lelouch of the Rebellion was done by Studio Sunrise who also produced other great titles such as Outlaw Star, Gundam series, Cowboy Bebop and Tiger and Bunny and to be honest Code Geass has really aged well visually\nFor starters Clamp really did an amazing job with the characters designs. They just very well designed and for the most part fit very well with the setting.\nThe animation for Code Geass R1 is great and smooth and has no stock-footage.\nSadly I cannot say the same thing for mecha designs as most of the mecha designs are very generic and boring to look at especially the grunt suits aka the Sutherland\nHowever, these are three mecha designs that I really like.\nThese were the Guren Mk-II, Gawain, and the Lancelot.\nI liked the design for them as they look really cool and they are very good at combat.\nOverall the visuals of Code Geass are very good.\n8/10\nSound.\nThe soundtrack for Code Geass is just great and it really fits with the setting and the theme of Code Geass rather nicely.\nOne of my favorite tracks in Code Geass is a track called Stories which is one of my favorite track pieces that I heard in any anime\nThe first opening of Code Geass is easily one of the best things about R1 because it's so iconic, memorable and not to mention the song itself is great.\nThe other two openings themes on the other are not so great. I personally found those next two opening to rather bland and they don't fit well to Code Geass at all.\nThe ending themes of Code Geass are great as they are very memorable and they fit with the tone of Code Geass very well.\nAs for voice acting, both the sub and dub are great in they own right as well as being well acted but I prefer the dub due to Johnny Yong Bosh amazing performance as Lelouch.\nThe rest of the characters sounded great in the dub in my opinion.\nOverall the soundtrack is great, the first opening was amazing, both endings are great and both sub and dub are great and well acted.\n8/10\nFinal Thoughts.\nAfter 6 years since I watched Code Geass for the first time how does the first season 1 hold up?\nFor me, Code Geass R1 has aged pretty well.\nIt has a good engaging story that will keep your edge on your seats, good world-building, good and enjoyable characters especially the main character Lelouch, Great visuals and animation besides the generic mecha design for the Sutherland. Great soundtrack along with a great English dub.\nSure it has issues such some annoying supporting characters as well as having a couple of story issues such as tone shifts for the school episodes to the plotholes but these issues can be ignored due how good the story and characters were for me.\nCode Geass will, unfortunately, take a dark turn for the worst as the squeal called Code Geass R2 which by the way won’t have a lot of positive praise from me. \nDespite that Code Geass R1 is a great and enjoyable classic in its own right. Not a masterpiece by any means but still a great show in its own right\n\nI give Code Geass R1 a 8/10.\nAnyway this was Shawn aka KurataTrigger and I will see you guys next time.\n        "},

The first, with the same title as the anime (Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion) focuses on Lelouch and more or less follows the series, with art by Majiko!, and began being serialized in Montly Asuka magazine in the Octpober 2006 issue.  The second, known as Code Geass: Suzaku of the Counterattack, focuses on Suzaku's part of the story, with art done by Atsuro Yomino, and is being serialized in Beans A\n          \n        magazine.  The third, Code Geass: Knightmare of Nanally, focuses on Nanally's part of the story, with art done by Tomomasa Takuma.\nThere is also a series of light novels that follows the series' plot that began serialization in Kadokawa Shoten's Sneaker magazine on April 28th, 2007.\nCode Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion is a twenty-five episode series that was produced by Sunrise (famous for their work on the Gundam series and Cowboy Bebop) and directed by Goro Taniguchi (famous for his work on Planetes and s-CRY-ed).  It ran on Japanese TV from October 5th, 2006 to July 28th, 2007, and has been licensed Stateside by Bandai.  Bandai has yet to release a date for its DVD release, but the dub will be airing on Adult Swim starting on April 26th (next Saturday!).\nStory: On August 10th, 2010, the Holy Empire of Britannia invaded Japan and conquered the country in less than a month with their mechs, known as Knightmare Frames.  Japan, renamed 'Area 11', was colonized, and the Japanese, now known as 'Elevens', were made to live in ghettos while the Britannians live in upper-class walled-off settlements.  Lelouch, then ten years old, swears to his friend Suzaku that some day, he will destroy the Britannian empire.  \nSeven years later, Lelouch is going to school at a private Britannian academy, known as Ashford Acadmey, and Suzaku's joined the Britannian army as an honorary Britannian.  One day, Lelouch gets caught up with terrorists escaping with a military secret, and Suzaku is part of the squad sent to capture the terrorists.  When Suzaku insists that Lelouch isn't one of the terrorists, he is shot for disobedience, and in the chaos that follows, the military secret is revealed to be a young girl named CC (or C Two), who contracts with Lelouch and gives him a power known as Geass, more specifically, the power to make anyone do anything he says just by looking them in the eyes.\nLelouch decides to bring Britannia down using his Geass, while Suzaku decides to attempt to change Britannia from the inside.\nThis is a good, solid series.  The set up's a bit like Death Note, in which we've got a guy in high school using the powers he's received to change the world (Lelouch), and there's someone opposing him and his ideals (in this case, Suzaku).  It's also like V for Vendetta, in that we've got Lelouch leading a rebellion against Britannia as the masked Zero.  \nThe series ends up being a neat juxtaposition of politics, mech action, plotting, rebellion, and school life.  And it's like Toward the Terra, in that a lot of the side characters are developed more than they would be in most series, are pretty intriguing, and end up playing major roles in the plot.  The plot progresses pretty nicely, with Lelouch figuring out how his powers work and building up his power and followers and attacks on Britannia, with a few calm-before-the-storm episodes that end up bringing some of the more awesome revelations, plenty of plot twists tossed in, all bought to a boil in the last few episodes, leaving off with that cliff hanger of cliff hangers.\nTaniguchi weaves in little homages from the other series he's directed, so if you've seen his other series, watch and see what you can find.\nIt's not without it's problems, though.\nFirst thing you'll probably notice is the rampant jingoism.  It's probably a bit more apparent to me, because I'm in an class about the ethnography of Japan, and we just finished a section on WWII, but, still, you'll notice a lot of BANZAI NIPPON! in the first few episodes.  For example, the date that Britannia (which, if you look at the bit before the OP, is, in fact, America) invades Japan is the day that Japan surrendered at the end of WWII.  It does get less noticeable as the series goes along, but you can still tell it's there.\nThe second fact is that the series brings up a lot of mysteries and doesn't really answer them, a la Rozen Maiden and Romeo and Juliet.  But at least they don't try and clumsily resolve things like in Nishi no Yoki Majo or Darker than BLACK.  Admittedly, there is a second season that just started airing in Japan about two weeks ago, so hopefully they can address those issues.\nArt: The animation for this is really smooth, not to mention vibrantly colored.  The action scenes are fully animated, as are the explosions and such, which is nice to see.\nYou can tell straight off the bat that Clamp does the character designs because the men are a bit pointy and lanky.  But once they're introduced, they get a bit less pointy, which makes the lankiness work out better.  And, of course, the females are absolutely beautiful.\nSunrise's mech designs do admittedly look a bit like Gundams, and a bit on the bulky side rather than streamlined but, for the mecha I've seen in anime (which, admittedly, isn't that much), they're pretty neat.\nThere's some stock footage for when Lelouch uses the Geass, and a bit of recap at the beginning before the OP, but, luckily, it's well-done and doesn't get too old.\nMusic: I like the music for this a lot.  There are some pretty basic themes and styles for specific people and things that happen, but there end up being a lot of well-done variations.  The insert songs that they do don't take away from the scene, but fit in perfectly. \nFor the most part, I liked the OPs and EDs for this.  The first (and, incidentally, the third ED) and third OP are your standard pop numbers, but they're really catchy.  The first ED is an ALI Project song, which, in my opinion, guarantees awesomeness.\nHowever, the vocalists for the second OP and ED (whether or not they're the same, I'm not sure) need to be strangled.  They're worse than the harpy woman who did the Honey and Clover OPs, and that's saying something.  They gave me headaches.\nSeiyuu: The seiyuu for this project are made of awesome on several levels.  Jun Fukuyama, who played the naive innocent Albert in Gankutsuou, gets to play the scheming jaded Lelouch, and it's particularly nice to see the role reversal there.  Kikuko Inoue, who played Mercedes in Gankutsuou, appears in a small, but important, supporting role, as do Jouji Nakata and Fumiko Orikasa.  Also, Suzaku's seiyuu may sound familiar, mainly because he's been voicing Cloud in the recent FFVII spinoffs.\nThe only seiyuu who really annoyed me was Lloyd's seiyuu, but then again, he's meant to come off as annoying.  They did their job there.  xD\nLength: Had they done some slight reworking of the plot, they probably could have made this a twenty-five episode series.  However, the story would've taken a hit if they had.  The second season, which, as I mentioned before, just recently started airing, should hopefully bring a sense of completeness to the story.\nOverall: A beautifully designed and animated show, with excellent music and seiyuu, and a very solid plot, save for the jingoism and unsolved mysteries, which will hopefully be solved by the next season.\nStory: 8/10\nArt: 9/10\nMusic: 9/10\nSeiyuu: 9/10\nLength: 8/10\nOverall: 43/50; 86% (B )\n        "},
			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=32, ["text"]="\n                          \n    The following is a review for Code Geass Lelouch of the Rebellion as well as it's second season R2.  Enjoy!\nImportant Notes:\n	Before we get into the actual review, I believe a quick bit of back story is important.  Code Geass was first conceptualized at Sunrise Animation in hopes to create a show that would appeal to a wide range of audiences.  The idea originally only entailed a underground resistance leader leading a double life.  The idea was then given to the manga author team of Clamp for character designs, (both physical and portions of other aspects as well) a partnership which continued\n          \n        through the writing process meaning many of the stories intricacies were also written with assistance from Clamp.  The idea was to cover the two largest demographics: Shonen (action and generally story based targeted at young males) and Shojo (relationship based normally set in more everyday scenarios).  The question is, were they successful?  Well, yes and no.  The problem is that if you swap between the main character's everyday life and his secret life at the drop of a hat with little in between, one party is usually unhappy.  There are entire episodes based on dating games and creating the world's largest pizza that barely contribute anything to the story.  They are immediately followed by two episode long battles in mech suits that get rather monotonous pretty fast.  Compare that to a show that, in my experiences, does appeal to almost every audience like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.  Brotherhood keeps the battles much shorter while keeping a ton of relationship and character development, and all of it is integrated together rather seamlessly to have everyone on their toes.  Compare that to the separated method which has a tendency to give the viewer minor whip lash.  What does save Code Geass is occasional episodes where everything collapses and the two worlds collide pretty beautifully.  Now that we have that out of the way, to the story!\nStory:\n	Code Geass has an enjoyably complicated story so if you're looking for something to watch while doing other things it might not be the best choice, but hey, a better choice than Baccano!  It features very few all out filler episodes, every episode has something that furthers the plot or some amount of character development no matter how small, (except maybe the dating game episode, I can see what was supposed to be character development but... yeah not really).  The only real story problem is that at times it seems like it could have ended right there but trust me everything happens for a reason and those who stick with it shall be rewarded eventually.  Well that was short, but I don't want to give anything away so let's just move on to characters.  	\nCharacters:\n	The fascinating thing about Code Geass's characters is that none of the \"good guys\" are particularly likeable, yet you grow to care for everyone anyway.  Our protagonist, Lalouch Vi Britannia, is a manipulative liar who tells us that the ends always justify the means.  Most of his school friends are, in my opinion, annoying, his little sister has a terrible voice and makes me cringe rather than daw, and the only character who acts entirely \"good\" is Suzaku, and he is the one character I didn't really grow to care for!  The Britannians on the other hand had several great characters who I loved despite their \"evil\" actions.  One thing Code Geass does amazingly well is kill people.  Sorry I had to be the one to tell you but you were going to find out eventually and, this is war, come on.  By the end you realize that your favorite characters are dead and aren't coming back and you honestly feel the same despair that the surviving characters do.  \nMusic & Sound:\n	Let's talk music.  At the beginning the background music is an awesome flavor of weird.  Odd moments in the eyes of the protagonists are highlighted by that sad trumpet.  I love that sad trumpet.  As the story progresses though sad trumpet leaves us and other than a few quick return visits to say hello and goodbye, doesn't really come back.  Other than that the background music is pretty average quality and is made mostly to emphasize the intensity of situations and regality of it all.  The opening and closing music varies VASTLY.  I loved some of the songs particularly those by FLOW and Ali Project then they are immediately followed by the second opening which I watched several times to be sure I wasn't making a snap decision but no, it's just bad.  I'm just going to combine the voice acting section in right here.  Decent.  Some characters were good.  Some were close to great!  But some were just bad.  Nunnaly is the number one culprit in my opinion.  I will never forget her unique and ear-bleeding inducing way of saying \"le-loooosh\" no matter how much I try.  On the brighter end though, without too much bias, Luciano Bradley in R2 is one of my favorite Vic Mignogna roles, Johnny Young Bosch does his usual thing for Lelouch which I guess is cool, Euphemia and Cornelia were very fitting, and last actor of mention is Troy Baker as Schnizel which is as amazing and regal as every Troy Baker role. \nArt:\n	Okay now just art and a quick conclusion, almost there.  The art style is quite unique and was made to mimic the original character designs by Clamp although it takes their drawing style to a new level.  Drawing quirks well known from works like Cardcaptor Sakura such as high shoulders, thin bodies, and incredible height, are extended to an odd level that every once in awhile makes you notice: \"Oh yeah, that's super not accurate to life... that's weird.  How does that work?\"  but it is quite well done and amazing.\nConclusion:\n	Well over all Code Geass is very good, it isn't perfect but nothing really is.  No matter if you prefer Shonen or Shojo or even if you're more like me and prefer something more moderate and balanced, if you can sit through the parts you don't like, you'll be pleased with the end result.  Tears will be shed, trust me on that.  I sadly had several deaths accidentally spoiled for me and told myself that I would not cry because I didn't even like that character anyway and then slowly lost my resolve.  Well thank you for reading and I hope my opinions were helpful to you.  If you can see anything I missed or misreported please let me know.  Bye for now!  "},
			{["score"]=5, ["helpful"]=18, ["text"]="                          \n    This review covers both the first and the second season of Code Geass. Code Geass is one of the most enjoyable anime I've ever seen. It's addictive, has awesome mecha fights, great music and an interesting main character. But it's also one of the most overrated anime ever created. \n\"What! Code Geass, overrated? Blasphemy! How dare you to insult one of the most popular and amazing anime this way, you just didn't understand this masterpiece!\"\nWell, Code Geass is not a masterpiece, the first season was pretty good, but the second season was just retarded. Why? \n~Story~ 4/10\nOur main character Lelouch is an exiled Britannian prince,\n          \n        who wants to avenge his dead mother and disabled sister. And (of course) the evil Britannian empire occupied Japan (again) and (of course) our hero joins with the brave rebels who want to free poor Japan (again). In exactly how many anime is Japan occupied by a foreign nation? It's not even funny anymore, do Japanese people have some kind of victim-syndrome? \nBut okay, our hero accidentally meets C.C. a pretty, mysterious girl who gives him superpowers, Geass. Now, Lelouch has to ability to control the will of everyone he sees, of course there are some limitations but Geass is extremely strong. This raises the question: Why did it take Lelouch so many episodes to achieve his goals? He did some things in the least effective way possible so the viewer could see more mecha fights and bombastic speeches, this is fun but it just doesn't make sense. Another problem with the story is that it doesn't really knows if it wants to be a high-school comedy or a serious and dramatic mecha anime with politics. You can't mix these two ideas and expect them to work, it is really weird that the viewers are supposed to care about stupid high-school drama after they have seen wars in which a lot of people died. Well, we see our protagonist in high-school and he teams up with the rebels and he tries to free Japan while having fun with the school council. The story progresses, apparently everyone in his school is either a rebel or part of the military and Lelouche wins every fight because of his \"brilliant\" strategies or Geass. There is a lot of melodrama, Lelouche has a harem, there is fanservice and he wins more battles, that's pretty much the first season. Then comes the second season, which is rated higher then the first, WHY? There were a few plot holes during the first season but during the second season there were plot holes everywhere. There were even more stupid comedic filler episodes and \"awesome\" new characters no one cared about (Rollo). Oh and almost every character aside from Lelouch and Suzaku became useless and added nothing to the plot, because of this there was almost no character development. And a lot of people have Geass-power because... Actually, I don't really know why. And Geass is now an explanation for everything. How did Lelouch win this fight against a stronger army? Geass. Why was his mother alive out of nowhere in a random supernatural Geass-world? Geass. A serious problem? Lelouch will Geass ex machina himself out of it. Also the fact that C.C. turned into a fanservice object because of amnesia is not okay. And then the ending, the greatest anime ending ever made! Haha no, the ending didn't make sense, Lelouch is not a hero, his behavior was out of character and this is not how world peace or politics works. But it's sad and there are feels, so everyone loved it *sigh*.\n[CONCLUSION]\nThe first season was decent, but the second season was a train wreck. At first Lelouch used Geass, but the power of Geass was limited and he tried to use cool strategies (though a bit stupid at times), but after a while every battle is won because of Geass and plot convience. And I'm not going to talk about the ridiculous amount of plot holes or the dead mother of Lelouch who appears in some kind of supernatural Geass-world for no good reason. Also the combination of high-school comedy and dramatic war scenes did not work, the same goes for Lelouche's bombastic speeches and hand gestures. And there are more explosions then in a Michael Bay movie, why? Because it looks cool and it's fun. That's exactly the problem with this anime, they try desperately to make everything look cool and fun while the plot is a mess.\n~Art~ 6/10\nI'm not a fan of this art style, CLAMP's character designs look ridiculous. Every girl has big boobs and every guy looks like a bishie. Also it was too colorful during the more dramatic and the darker parts of the story. And the facial expressions are a bit over-the-top at times, I don't think that the makers were trying to make me laugh when the characters were sad or angry, but their facial expressions were so stupid now and then. Though I have to admit, the animation was original and the battles looked very nice.\n[CONCLUSION]\nI hated the character designs, but that is something personal. It was a little bit too colorful and Lelouch looked like a clown when he was sad or angry. Still, I think that the animation was pretty good.\n~Music~ 8/10\nThe opening were all in between average and good, they were not extremely special, but they were fitting. I really liked 'COLORS' by FLOW, but it wasn't very original. The same thing goes for the ending songs. The background music was very good but a little bit too bombastic at times. There was nothing wrong with the (Japanese) voice acting, actually it was very good.\n[CONCLUSION]\nThe music was great, the opening and ending song were fitting and there wasn't one bad opening or ending song. Also, the background music and the voice acting were very good.\n~Characters~ 3/10\nLelouch is an interesting character, everyone else isn't. Literally no one aside from Lelouch is interesting, let alone well-written. Suzaku is just an annoying, hypocritical whiner, Nunnaly is the useless, cute little sister in a wheelchair, C.C went from a powerful mysterious women to a fanservice object with amnesia, Shirley was just fanservice combined with forced drama and she kept screaming 'Lulu' at Lelouch in the most annoying way possible, Charles Vi Britannia is a stereotypical cartoon villain, Kallen was just part of Lelouche's stupid harem, what was actually the purpose of Rollo aside from annoying the viewers? Euphemia was a bland cute and nice girl and some girls were just in there for fanservice. I almost believed that Nina was the most interesting character of the whole supporting cast.... ok never mind, I take that back, poor table *shiver*. \nBut even the best character of this show, Lelouch, is not that good. His motivations and behavior keeps changing when the plot needs them to change. And everyone thinks that Lelouch is a genius, why actually? Because he plays chess or comes up with farfetched strategies that magically work? Lelouch is a perfect, pretty boy who is supposed to be smart and has a harem, when I think about it, he reminds me of Kirito from Sword Art Online.... ok, I also take that back, he's a better character than Kirito (not like that's saying much), but still he is not a brilliantly written character like his enormous fan base claims. His character development is inconsistent and the fact that during the final episode he stops behaving like an enormous jerk, doesn't turn him into a hero, this jerk started a war that killed millions of humans for the sake of his stupid revenge and his stupid sister. He's either an anti-hero or just a villain, so please stop with the \"All hail Lelouch, he's the savior of mankind\"-crap. \n[CONCLUSION]\nThe characters were so damn bland. Most of them were annoying or useless, some of them were quite decent during the first season, but during the second season everyone aside from Lelouch and Suzaku turned into furniture, they just were there without contributing anything to the plot. We also got a bunch of new characters during the second season where no one asked for (yes Rollo, I'm talking about you). But the worst thing was what they did with C.C. She lost her memories and went from a supernatural and powerful women to dumb little girl who was constantly half-naked for the sake of fanservice, this annoyed the heck out of me. Good job writers, good job!\n~Enjoyment~ 9/10\nBombastic speeches with over-the-top arm gestures and dramatic background music, epic mecha battles, a lot of explosions and an awesome though ridiculous ending: this show is extremely enjoyable. I was entertained from the first till the last episode, yes this show had a lot of problems but it was never boring. I can understand why people like this show so much, it's plain fun!\n[CONCLUSION]\nAn enjoyable show with a lot of problems, if you love Michael Bay movies, you'll also love Code Geass. If you just want to have fun and turn your brain off, then go watch this show. But if you prefer well-written characters, consistent story lines and if you hate plot holes and characters that are nothing more than plot devices or fanservice, go watch something else, you'll wast your time on Code Geass. Peace!\n        "},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=31, ["text"]="\n                          \n    I had high hopes for this show, and it certainly delivered.\nFirst off, the story; In 2010, the Holy Empire of Britannia -which rules about a third of the world- decided to invade Japan, the Japanese resistance didn't last long against Britannia's new fighting robots, the Knight-mares. After adding the country to its territories, it was renamed Area 11, with its citizens dubbed 'Elevens'. Now after all of this, the protagonist, Lelouch, vows to destroy Britannia. 7 years later, he gets caught up in a terrorist attack and the mysterious girl C.C. grants him the power of 'Geass', the ability to make anyone obey your order.\n          \n        Using that power, Lelouch adopts the identity of Zero -a masked rebel- and sets off to destroy Britannia and free Japan from its clutches, with his primary goal -other than defeating Britannia- being the protection of his little sister, Nunally.\nSome people may be skeptical about the art style, but I find it beautiful. The credit for the character design goes to the manga group 'Clamp', I personally never watched or read anything from them, but CG looks marvelous and I have to give them credit for the amazing work that they've done on the characters' designs.\nFrom there we get to the sound and music, and I don't really have much to say on this except for, go listen to the first opening. The music of the show does a good job immersing you in the show, through all moments, from an action scene to a flashback to a character death to... pizza?\nThe characters vary from 'I'll kill myself if you die' to 'Hurry up and die'. Reasonable Lelouch and retarded (for lack of a better word) Suzaku, Poor table-kun and *cough* PERVERTED, CRAZY, PSYCHO AND OVERLY ATTACHED NINA.\nOverall, the enjoyment I got from this show was great, and it's definitely worth your time. So if you haven't watched it, then you should\n        "},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=33, ["text"]="                          \n    I'm here to talk about the both seasons of Code Geass. I don´t want to make 2 reviews about it so i will do as i did with Clannad. \n\nCode Geass .. one of the best rated animes here on MAL .. for sure it deserves it ! \nStory: (9/10). It is a complex story, usually or this go terribly wrong, or goes extremely well. It depend if it gets confuse or not. This story starts to be a normal one, but then with some twists we get lost for some time until we figure everything out at the end. The plot is original and\n          \n        creative. It is about world domination and one of the new colonies named 11 starting a huge rebellion for freedom(and ofc this one it had to be Japan). The leader of the Rebellion is Lelouch, our main character. \nI found the plot nice, but this is a progressive anime, gets better with the time. So at the beginning, it may seem boring, and it is but don´t give up, it is worth to watch. Then after the 8th episode, things starts to get hot :D. \nThis anime talks about a lot of shit.. really it talks about a lot of themes from love to immortality. From world domination and how is it like to lose our rights as a nation, to what happens when some one gets sick of revenge and power. I can´t tell you more otherwise i would be spoiling but you get the point. It is really interesting to watch this show.  \nThe story is fluent at some point (when it doesn't get confuse). It is solid and I found no plot holes here. \nArt: (8/10). The character design is pretty normal. The characters are solid and have a peculiar shape (all look pretty skinny and tall) and we have really different looks between the characters. The anime is really coloured and the machines (this anime is a mecha anime) are really well designed. The detail is outrageous. The action here gets super nice due to the detail ! \nCharacter: (9/10). This is the thing here ! For me the best aspect to see in this anime. We have C2, Lelouch and Suzaku taking the first place as the main characters. While C2 is a mistery until the end, Suzaku and Lelouch have their development since the first episode. While Lelouch suffers a transformation due to his power (geass), Suzaku suffers as well a transformation. He is a japanse who joined the Britannia army(Britannia were the ones who conquered Japan and named it \"11\". So he basically is fighting with his enemy). The anime gets good because of this. The interaction between them 2 and their development is really interesting. They were friends since childhood and now they are like enemys (because Lelouch  is the one who is fighting against Britannia while Suzaku is the one who tries to stop the rebellion). So having these 2 main characters makes the plot much more fun rather then just huge machines destroying each other. \nThe other characters are pretty as usual as in the other animes. In general, i found them to be really realistic which is rare. But some of them make quetionable choices... he/she would really do that?  ~\nHere we have everything. Normal characters, super strong ones, super weak ones, and those characters that we just can´t know what they are. If they are bad or good, if they are strong or weak. This gives some kind of mistery around them and it is something that at least for me it was nice. \nSo basically, there is a huge variety of characters here, that's why i belive it is the best point here to be considered. \nSound: (9/10). We have 2 good openings, while the other 2 suck. But when we have such nice OST no one cares about the openings. Lelouch as a leader of the rebellion, he often makes inspiring speeches and the OST that they use for it it is just epic :D. Not just here, throughout the entire show we see nice OST in pretty much everything. In the romance, in the drama, in the action.. and then we have that finnal OST that almost made me cry :D. So the sound in general has a nice effect on the show, makes it look better. So does what it is suposed to do ( making the scenes better) \nEnjoyment: (9/10) I did not give 10 because for me, the 10 would be an anime which all episodes were fun or cool to watch. Such thing does not happens here. As i said, sometimes the plot gets nasty and we can get confused, and the first part of the show is just too boring compared to the rest. But besides that, it make me hooked. The consistent plot twist and the development of the plot was so nice. It also has a nice drama and a litle bit of romance. It is a litle, but it is good !. Plus seeing the huge machines (by they way the are called \"knightmare\") fighting is really epic. Some fights are even better than the fights in some shonens.  \nThis anime is one of those anime that i will never forget... With this end and this characters, it makes it really unique. Unlike some other animes that can be good but are normal. This one is good and not normal so it becames memorable! \nAbout the end? One of the best i've ever seen. It has everything to be a good end. They give an end but at the same time, we can chose our own end and get happy with it. So i think it would be hard for anyone to dislike this anime. \n\nOverall, this anime has everything to be a good anime and that's why it is so known and so well rated. This anime also has a lot of psychological fights so if you liked Death Note you will problably like this one to. If you never saw something like this, well give it a try. It happens that having a super inteligent guy taking controll of an entire army at the age of 17 is really epic xD. \n        "},

The anime contains lots of various elements as in technology, super powers, intellect etc. which COULD HAVE ruined it due to over crowding of too many features BUT as they are well planned and placed, it complements to the story and keeps the views entertained and occupied thoroughly. The interesting combination and relations of the character is what I liked the best which keeps the momentum of the anime going and makes the anime more interesting. However the battle of the wits and intellect is my favorite part of the\n          \n        anime. The constant urge to be best and outsmart the other make me rewind and view certain parts again to fully understand the process. Character of Lelouch intrigues to the fullest. His progression from chaotic good  to chaotic neutral is worth mentioning and understanding. He in lots of ways makes this anime more interesting, all being about good v/s bad morally and proving a point is attracting. \nIf you like this Anime you should also try:\nNo Game No Life\nDeath Note\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=32, ["text"]="\n                          \n    Code Geass- Hangyaku no Lelouch is definitely one of my favorites yet I found the most difficult to review because of its complexity. \nStory (9/10)\nFans' first impression: Gundam + Deathnote= Code Geass. That opinion was normal and may somehow be correct but it is definitely not an acceptable conclusion: the story is a beautiful mix of mecha, school life and epic soap opera. Code Geass may have some familiar elements and some may think \"ah, i know this type\" but when one gets absorbed in the plot; he/she will find a very unique anime with surprising twists:\nThe unique thing I find in this series its\n          \n        very hard to categorize: on the outer surface it is called mecha but the robots and their pilots' endeavors are not mainly the ones that make the story progress, they are just players of the game not the rules. CG is has exciting action scenes but the ones that really thrilled me are the: psychological and tactic's clashes, character development and choices and their interaction with other characters, who the good or bad guy really is and many mysteries being revealed one by one or further mystified.\nThe story has lots of irony yet like a fruit salad; different ingredients and tastes good altogether and still distinguishable, the story is very well focused on one point though it has a lot of attributes. An idealistic and righteous but selfish and hypocritical view battles with a realistic, practical but dark and personal goal. In these brain popping thoughts, humor, sarcasm and teenage drama is added together with politics and racial conflict. Here humanism is a tasty ingredient present in every side growing within every tragedy and angst.\nArt (9/10)\nTechnically, the animation is super consistent, high definition and vivid. The machines are so cool and effects like explosion, sparks and water movements are satisfying. \nClamp has made a wonderful job designing the animation. But if one's not fond of thin characters and pretty boys, animation may be not too satisfying.\nArt, not only animation, in this series in my opinion is innovative; classic and modern concepts are also used. The one thing noticeable in this series is the outfits; they are post-modern European inspired yet manipulated into pilot suits, uniform(both in military and school) and casual wear into \"anime\" fashion (with Japanese preferences). At first I thought that the \"vampire cape\" and \"mask\" is kinda dorky showing a classic evil and mysterious appearance but I eventually loved it, not to mention the minions' \"evil\" but cool appearance too (which are actually good guys) \nSound (8/10)\nThough I like some tracks, I was not impressed by the opening and ending themes except \"Colors\". Sometimes they destroyed the mood or annoy me. Nevertheless the background music still give the right mood: Insert songs are well placed and memorable.\nCharacter (9/10)\nThe characters strongly inspire both love and haterd; some are very unique while some are ordinary. That composition is helpful because too many complex characters will make the plot confusing and unfocused. Though one can say that not all characters are exceptional; their interactions are full of twists and developments! CG featured well some much more complex new tastes in anime characters:\n               a dark, byronic main character that is insanely smart and good-looking that needs gym classes\n               a good, kind guy who is the greatest mockery of the concept of heroism\n               a mysterious, sexy green haired lead heroine that probably knows and understands more things than any of the characters\nTheir characters deepens as the series progresses and they are meticulously designed in way that they are both the protagonists and the antagonists of the series, both hero and anti-hero or both villain and anti-villain.\nAs for the themes, I personally think that they are action and thrill on the surface,yet deep down, it is back boned in simple human desires, ambitions, frustrations and opinions. Nevertheless, this series is definitely not depressing, not deep as deep as the ocean that ordinary viewers will not even understand the story and I found that it contains weirdness both in humor, drama and tragedy. \nEnjoyment, Personal Response and Overall:\n\nI really enjoyed this one, very addictive and offers a lot of mystery. I found the main characters very likable especially Lelouch the main character. I found it really cool.\nAlso, this story as a whole is not yet finished, it has a direct sequel: Code Geass r2.\nI don't recommend this anime to grade-schoolers because it the story and visual interpretation shows a lot of controversial and violent things and may not answer the question \"What's the moral lesson?\"\nOVERALL: 10"},

And I'm certainly no fan of Clamp's designs/art either. I watched, regardless, as there had been a lot of hype surrounding it, and I was quite interested in it based on what I had seen.\nCode Geass is a series which left me confused about ow I should feel towards it. On one hand I had just viewed a wonderfully animated, well developed story with nice character designs and some plot twists which drew me in intensely. On the other, I had just viewed an\n          \n        anime with grossly styled art, fairly typical character personalities, and an abundance of scenes that tried to hard to shock, and succeeded - for all the wrong reasons. \nI'm not sure what else to say. But I feel Code Geass is an anime you'll either love or hate, it's probably best to give it a go and make your mind up yourself, but I seriously warn anyone who has heard all the hype - it's not THAT good. \n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=29, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Code Geass. That's surely an anime most anime watchers have at least heard about. Some consider it amazing and some consider it overrated. But maybe it's a little bit of both?\n\nStory: 9. The story revolves around Lelouch Vi Britannia, an intelligent exiled prince with a sister complex and some daddy issues. In the Code Geass world, Britannia (we all know it's Britain) has taken over 1/3 the world, including Japan, and renaming it Area 11. Lelouch is an exiled prince of Britannia with a dead mother and a crippled sister. He swears vengeance on his father after he banished Lelouch and his little sister, Nunnally\n          \n        to Japan. One day, when caught up in a terrorist attack by some Japanese (Elevens) rebels he meets a mysterious young woman named C.C who grants him a power. Geass, the power of absolute control over anyone (except her lol). With this power and his intellect, he vows to take down Britannia, and create a gentle world where his little sister can be happy. He dons the persona of a masked figure called Zero and manipulates some Japanese into thinking he's doing it to save Japan, while using his Geass and intelligence to win battles against Britannia (though he doesn't win all of them).\nNow the universe of Code Geass is quite original, but it doesn't sound that special. Well, the story is not exactly Code Geass's strong point. And for the love of God, it's NOT a Death Note copy.\n\nArt: 8. The art is solid, with CLAMP's lanky characters and pointy chins. Even though I'm not a mecha fan (CG has mecha but it's not a mecha anime like let's say Gundam), I can appreciate the good animation and designs of the robots. Also, animation when the characters are like walking and small stuff like that is pretty great too.\n\n\nSound:9. Code Geass has a good OST. While most of the OP and ED aren't that memorable the background music that play during the show are usually quite good, from music for sad scenes to battle music. I find myself even personally downloading some of them, such as Deeply Fast.\n\n\nCharacter: 10. Ah, the characters.... Where do I begin? We have Lelouch Lamperouge (A.K.A Lelouch Vi Britannia) the hero of the show. Er...well, sort of. He's more like the byronic hero actually or the anti-hero. These are typically the reasons people compare him to Light Yagami of Death Note and they're both also highly intelligent, but unlike Light, Lelouch has morals, and a sense of compassion. And even when he does some pretty immoral stuff (like blowing up some soldiers and making it look like suicide) you can't help but cheer for him. It's odd, but there's something so charismatic and charming about him that you just want him to win!\nBut surprisingly, Lelouch doesn't overshadow the rest of the cast. You have C.C the mysterious, immortal and sarcastic girl (actually over 500 years old) who gave Lelouch his Geass. Everything she spoke I hung onto her every word. We have Kallen, the kick-ass, fanservice girl in the show, and Nunnally, the crippled little sister you have to feel bad for.\nOh wait, I'm forgetting Suzaku, Lelouch's former best friend. Suzaku has very similar goals as Lelouch's, (to stop the oppression of the Elevens and create a better world) but a very different way of going about them. Suzaku and Lelouch are best friends in school, but enemies on the battlefield. Neither of them knows each other's secret identity. While Lelouch leads a group of terrorists named the Black Knights to destroy Britannia, Suzaku (even though he's an Eleven) joins the Britannian Military, and want to change Britannia from within. Oh....idealistic Suzaku. Code Geass has a wide range of characters, most of them interesting and some of them bash-your-brains-out-annoying *cough*Nina*cough*.\n\n\nEnjoyment: 10, definitely. Code Geass is a wild ride, no doubt about it. Lelouch doing his tricks to score the Japanese several victories, with more plot twists than Evangelion. (But in a good way) It's also quite psychological, and EVERY FREAKING EPISODE ends on a cliffhanger: always leaves you wanting more. But Code Geass isn't without it's flaws...a few questions remain unanswered, and though most of them are answered in the second season, it's still kind of confusing. It's also very faced paced with about 3 storylines going on at the same time, at all times. Personally, I liked this and never found it overwhelming. But it might be different for some.\n\n\nOverall: Code Geass is a psychological, action, with a bit of romance (and even a bit of politics), thriller. It always leaves you wanting more, and by the conclusion you won't hesitate to start the next season.\n\n\n\n"},

It forces you to think hard after every episode, make theories what the Zero's next step will be and completely devote youreself to it while watching. The political critisicm(atleast I think it is) in this show is huge.

This is almost exactly what happened in Code Geass. \nThe story in this show is so twisting\n          \n        and turning that I never once knew what was going to happen. The thing is, it's so well thought through that the most obscure things can happen and still it fits in to the story. Truly a masterpiece. \nThe art is typical CLAMP, very tall and majestic.

There is a thin line between masterpiece and crazy and how CLAMP did the characters is so close to cross it. So much emotion is shown in the action of the characters that it will probably make you cry. Hate and insanity is very common among the many outstanding characters in Code Geass so if you don't like that you can skip it. Yet somehow, in the middle of all the bloodshed, they manage to squeeze in some love. They did it in such a way that proves that this anime isn't all darkness and hate.\nOverall this series is horrible and dark with a glimt of light at the end of the tunnel.

He also bares many similarities with Reinhard also, empires fighting federations, peoples demanding independence etc. However Code Geass has a lot of dissonance dissonance from the extreme amounts of comedy they insert randomly and the political drama is much more toned down than other series.\nAnd to those comparing it to Death Note. Death Note de-constructs the themes in shows of its demographic (shounen) of teenage males possessing unimaginable\n          \n        power and mixes it with crime thriller and supernatural horror to success.

This story in a single word would be wow. From the first episode the series never drops the ball. Like i said\n          \n        before i had watched Guilty Crown before this so i wasn't really sure what to expect, and when C.C. originally gave him the power of the Geass, I had thought to myself \"that's it?\" but I've never been so wrong. Yes it may not be as cool as Guilty Crown's \"Power of the King\", but the ability to give any order with total obedience couldn't be better fitted then to Lelouch. The series is filled with twists and turns always wanting to watch the next episode. Its a great mix of story and action with the Knightmares. At the end of season 1 you will immediately want to start the 2nd season.\nNext the music, this is really the only thing ill gripe about, I feel like there wasn't enough. Really all i can say about this one.\nCharacters. This series does an amazing job both with the writing for each character and the voice acting (I've only watched the subbed version). Lelouch is an awesome character. He has so many sides, just when you think you know or understand him, he throws a curve ball and shows you a new side. He can go from cold and calculating, to caring, to off the deep end upset and that's just a normal day for Lelouch. I feel like so many series fall short with screen time between main and supporting characters but this one does it right. Never do you see a relationship spark up and die in the same episode, or random people show up and then are gone the next episode. They start and finish with roughly the same group of characters. Each of the supporting characters get a decent amount of screen time and story around them.\nEnjoyment. I've already started to rewatch the series, do i need to say more?\nOverall this is now my favorite series. Perfect mix of characters and story. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll be on the edge of your seat begging for more.\n        "},

Not every series has it, but generally ones that do, tend to succeed. \n*SPOILERS FOR CODE GEASS. THIS REVIEW WILL GET REALLY LONG , SO STRAP YOURSELF IN, GRAB YOURSELF SOME PIZZA HUT, AND GRAB A DAKIMAKURA IF YOR WAIFU OF CHOICE (SUCH AS C.C.), CUZ I'M HEADING IN*\nFlash back to 2006 for a moment. There were three gigantic series came out that year: The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Death Note, and Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion. Each of these three series were hyped up to no belief, and their notoriety became global. Then, two years later,\n          \n        when these series were getting dubs, their popularity here increased greatly.  As such, this series needs as much introduction as its protagonist: none. With all that said, there is a question to be asked, and it can apply to all three series. Did this series deserve such hype and acclaim? Well, let's find out, shall we?\nSTORY: 7/10\nAfter 20 fucking rewrites of the original episode (look it up), we start 7 years prior, to when Lelouch, Nunnally, and Suzaku were kids. They travel through some depressing scenery as they watch Japan fight a losing  battle against Britannia. We soon learn that this battle finished in less than a year due to Britannia's new weapons: Knightmares; the mechs used in this series. This, Lelouch declares that someday, he'll wage war against Britannia, for abandoning him and his sister, and dumping them into the land where a war is taking place.\nThe introductory episodes to this series were really strong, strong enough that even with a fair amount of plot holes and other issues (that we will soon get to), I still consider the story to be a good one. After all, a solid introduction can give your story a huge advantage against one that is able as flawed but with a mediocre or even bad first outing, and yes, this applies to R2 as well as you'll see next time. Here, we mainly focus on four major players in this game known as war: Lelouch, Suzaku, Kallen, and C.C. (or C2 in the dub), and see how Britannia has treated them to some extent. After two school students, namely Lelouch and Rivalz, start coming back from their gambling match of chess, Lelouch suddenly walks into a terrorist plot: the Japanese, reduced to a mere number (11, since after the loss, Japan is referred to as Area 11) are rebelling against Britannia. We humorously cut back to Rivalz trudging back to class, cursing Lelouch all the while, meanwhile, we see their classmates doing classmate things. The few Japanese people a part in this terrorist rebellion plot (Kallen and Naoto) are carrying poison gas, but it ends up being a lie: instead, a girl named C.C. is accidentally freed by Lelouch and Suzaku (who got there at the time), but the Britannians catch up to them, and C.C. is shot. As Lelouch grabs her, she gives him the power of Geass, and thus, after testing out his powers by forcing thos about to kill him to kill themselves instead, his quest begins. With such a premise, you can tell that this series has ambition, but what to do with it? Where to go from here? Who and what to establish? Well...\nAlso, Suzaku, like the overly idealistic dumbass that he is, has joined up with with the Britannian army, for reasons I'll get to. He is wounded by his superior (who probably should've shot him in the head if he wanted him dead and out of the way) , but is joined up with Lloyd and Cecile, two members who assign him a new mech: the Lancelot. With this, he and his comrades disrupt the terrorist retaliation after the Britannians kill everyone in Shinjuku, where the terrorists are gathered. Meanwhile, Lelouch and C.C. (who turns out to be immortal due to the Geass that she can grant to people, but that point is badly explained) exit and she eventually joins him due to their contract enacted at the end of the first episode.\nAfter getting Kallen and the Japanese rebels to safety via his impressive skills as a tactician, Lelouch rushes to kill the one occupying Shinjuku, that man being Clovis. However, since Lelouch still in school, he needs to find a way to rework his schedule to begin his revolution in secret while mastering how new gifted power of Geass, and keeping his ultimate identity a secret to everyone, including Kallen, whom he has working under his stead. This leads me into one thing I need to dispel, of you don't mind me slowing things down a bit.\nPeople often criticize the school episodes and scenes as a bad tone-shift that adds nothing but pointless filler. All of this is beyond wrong, in plenty of ways. The first episode provides an obvious hint to this school setting and its potential relevance, so we all should've seen this coming. Plus, the show almost always manages to transition into the school scenarios seamlessly, instead of just slapping it on to interrupt a harsh scene like with most bad tone-shifts. Besides, the tones of the war and fun school life always intersect at the worst possible times for our protagonist, but that only really hits home near the end. As for the scenes themselves, they are clearly used to flesh out Lelouch's normal life and flesh out some of the supporting cast, regardless of how you feel about them. Here, we meet Nunnally, Lelouch's little sister and reason for living. She is blind and crippled, so Lelouch has to take care of her, with a maid, Sayako. Nunnally is definitely not one of the stronger members, mainly serving as Lelouch's motivation for beginning his quest to take down Britannia, and to provide some extra levity along with Lelouch's classmates. They provide a source of levity and comedy to the series, and the backdrop for some of the more epic scenarios, particularly in the last 5 episodes.\nEpisode 4 is where this conquest really begins. Lelouch dawns a costume he and Sayako created (that's what I'm assuming, since they never showcase the costume's origins), which becomes his alter-ego: Zero. He convinces Kallen, and the rebels, namely: Ohgi, Tamaki, and a few others, to join him, promising them a miracle to prove them that they can trust him. Turns out, after Clovis's assassination, Suzaku is arrested, and wrongly accused of murder: this is Zero's perfect chance to preform his first miracle. The second half of the episode plays out like an incredibly hype trailer: people panicking, interrupted by a brief glimpse of our hero dawning a piece of his outfit, all building up to his first big act, where he secretly demonstrates his power, creates the legendary meme of calling Jeremiah Gottwald \"Orange Boy\", and rescues Suzaku with the biggest level of charisma ever displayed in such a scene that is so epic, that the camera man known as Diethard is gawking is absolute awe. Sure, Suzaku goes back anyway, but we have Zero a new team, as well as a new rivalry in the fact that Suzaku and Zero reveal their methods of wanting to change the world and go their separate ways. Funny how they would both be classmates by the next episode, and how Suzaku doesn't know that Lelouch is Zero yet Lelouch knows that Suzaku is a soldier of Britannia.\nEach battle is carefully crafted, but each time a new variable ends up dicking over one side, whether that be Zero's or Britannia's, meaning that it's not a case of Lelouch always being a lucky man, let alone a Gary Stu as some people erroneously claim. In fact, the very next battle, Lelouch and co. vs Cornelia, already proves the Gary Stu claim wrong since he underestimates her prowess, which catches him off guard when after he steals an enemy Knightmare, she demands an inspection and retrieval of all units. He was only saved by C.C. dressing as Zero and providing a distraction (and before you ask, it wouldn't be risky for her st all given that she has been shown to handle getting shot before due to her immortality). After the Japanese Liberation force takes over the hotel that Lelouch's and Suzaku's classmates are in, both sides agree to take down this threat. Inside, as Nina (one of the classmates) is threatened, a captive princess by the name of Euphemia steps up to the oppressor, to her admiration (causing an unhealthy obsession that I'll get to). She even gets to see Zero, where he tells her why he hates the Britannian Royal Family. After the day is saved, Lelouch introduces his rebellion team: The Black Knights. There's also the mediocre episode about Kallen not liking her mother and then discovering just how bad her mom's drug abuse was and why she did it but we don't speak of that basic and bland episode.\nEpisodes 10 through 12 are where things start truly hitting hard, and I mean that in both good and bad ways. Kallen gets a new mech titled Guren Mk.II, which can cause a Knightmare to slowly bulge up and implode on itself, which she demonstrates on Jeremiah's mech, even though he ejects in a bloodied state. She also uses it to cause a landslide to cripple their foes, meaning that Cornelia (who stepped in after Clovis died) has lost a ton of her forces. I'll get back to that landslide later. Remember the power of Geass? They show clips alluding to its origin, but it is very vague. That's actually a big issue with the anime, it doesn't explain Geass well, as if it expects season 2 to really explain everything about Geass (instead of making it worse like R2 actually ended up doing). When Lelouch is cornered by the Lancelot, C.C. somehow transmits waves of one's past to him (try explaining that one) and Lelouch grabs on, showing C.C.'s and Suzaku's hidden pasts. Due to Suzaku's presence, they retreat or now, but the enemy is crippled, and most of the city below has been evacuated. However...\nShirley is distraught. Reason being, her dad was killed in the landslide from the battle, which ties in to the investigation a Britannian named Villetta Nu starts in order to find Zero's identity. Thus, Lelouch's inner turmoil begins, and it will follow him to the end of the season and beyond. Jeremiah passes out, and if you're less vigilant, you'll just assume he died there with no confirmation, when the more vigilant people will notice a dead list with Jeremiah's name on it. We get a new mission where the Japanese Liberation Front is trying to escape from. Then, as a distraction, Lelouch blows them all to high hell, creating one of the most infamous moments in the show. People often criticize this as Lelouch idiotically killing his allies. The truth is, in prior episodes, Lelouch has shown open disdain towards the Japanese Liberation front, so, even though they are passively offering supplies to The Black Knights, they are a nuisance, so it makes sense that Lelouch would kill them off as a decoy. Well, after the mission goes wrong, Zero's identity is revealed to Shrley and Villetta. Of course, out of teenage emotional confusion, Shirley shoots Villetta to cover up his identity, in which she is stranded, and picked up by Ohgi (cuz he's a nice guy), and she now has no memory (how the hell does that work?). Then, a messed up mofo named Mao emotionally toys with her to get to Lelouch. Turns out Mao also has a Geass power: involuntary mind-reading, and it's not fun for him at all, especially after C.C. (his contractor before Lelouch) left him several years ago. After a confrontation, Lelouch erases Shirley's memory in order to end her torment. \nThen, he pulls of his first Batman Gambit, a gambit that requires you to manipulate what your opponent will do ahead of time in order to outsmart them. He does this twice. Once when he stalls Mao long enough to get cops over to his location and shoot him (and none of the shots end up killing him, which is contrived as hell, and they hand-wave this via semantics, which is rather sleazy of you, anime) in order to help C.C. and get back at him for what he did to Shirley, and once more when, after Mao kidnaps Nunnally and both Lelouch and Suzaku search for her (and Suzaku outruns a ceiling machine gun in over-the-top fashion, and he uses his badass and surprisingly realistic parkour skills to run up a wall, jump off it, and kick the gun off the ceiling), he uses the Geass to erase his memory of seeing where Nunnally is (making Suzaku find a way to free her while Lelouch heads up to face Mao) that way after he loses to Mao in a chess match to decide Nunnally's fate, she is freed, and Suzaku kicks his ass. Still, Mao reminds him of his past, causing him to be traumatized, pissing Lelouch enough to use the Geass on Mao to cause him to never speak again, causing Mao to run into C.C., who shoots him upside the head, killing him and sending him into C's world (which I'm betting was meant to be expanded upon in season 2).\nAnother battle ensues, and Kallen, Suzaku, Euphemia, and Zero are all stranded, and Kallen and Suzaku on one end of an island, and Euphemia and Zero on the other (in which she discerns his identity) try to survive the day and meet up, on the ruins involved with the Geass. They got there because, at the last moment, just as the Britannians were about to sacrifice Suzaku to kill Zero (in which Kallen and Euphemia try to stop Suzaku from trapping Lelouch), he uses his geass on Suzaku to make him survive and lead everyone away, but somehow with two separate teams. The ruins collapse, and Suzaku how suspects Lelouch of being Zero. \nThere were 5 cavalry members in the fight that took place during episode 11, with the main one being a man named Todoh, who was a major battler in the war 7 years prior. I only bring this up now since they weren't very important there as opposed to here and onward. Todoh has been arrested (somehow), and The Black Knights, as well as Todoh's subordinates,'free him in one of the most charismatic and fun episodes of the show, especially thanks to the song played during the moment they drew him and are actually aided by Suzaku. Some have accused this of being nothing but fuller but in reality, it frees Todoh for the final battle, shows off the Gawain for the audience in real combat so that it wouldn't be just there for one battle thereby wasting it, and reinforced is of Suzaku's suspicion of the identity of Zero\nRemember when I said how things would really go to hell in the last 5 episodes starting with the school? Well, here we go. Euphemia meets Nunnally again, much to their delight in the school festival, Ohgi takes a still amnesiac (and friendly) Villetta to the school only for random classmates to drag them into the festival, Kallen encounters Ohgi, and Euphemia starts a campaign to create a safe zone for both Britannians and the Japanese to coexist, much to Lelouch's, Diethard's, and the family's shock and disdain. She invites Zero over, but in episode 22, they just now reveal that a geass can go haywire (I'm assuming that Mao's could never be truly controlled, since they show Mao as a kid tormented by it), in which, after Euphemia manages to convince Zero to join her, it suddenly goes haywire after he jokes about the fact that if he told her to kill the Japanese, the geass would make her do it. It just seems horribly forced and contrived since they could've alluded to it earlier (barring one small foreshadowing earlier in the episode which still comes out of nowhere overall) and showed methodical buildup to this. Hell, we should've seen signs of this in the Mao arc, which was basically a cautionary tale of what could happen if Lelouch overused Geass.\nSo, Euphemia shoots up the Japanese is a grizzly scene, causing Zero to have to kill her, as he cannot make it stop, and this gets to Suzaku and Nina BADLY! He, much to his own guilt, uses this as a motivation for everyone to make one final stand against Britannia, and the battle for Tokyo's independence begins. Things shit the bed from the word go, as the Black Knights invade the school and Ohgi gets shot by Villetta who suddenly remembers everything for literally no reason other than plot contrivance. Given how much we got to know Lelouch's classmates and the school, this moment is all the more intense, which is the ultimate purpose of the school scenes: to make this moment as effed up as possible due to prior experience. Suzaku is charging in with blood-stained fury in his eyes, ready to kill Zero, duking it out with Kallen before they both try dealing with other threats, until he is trapped by the same mechanism that trapped him in episode 19. With him outta the way, Zero goes after Cornelia, and just as she tries going in for the kill, her best subordinate named Dalton (under the control of the geass) lauhces a spear through her mech while making absolutely sure that the attack doesn't impale her or cause the mech to explode (which is REALLY STRETCHING IT, ANIME!!!). Lelouch then tries to get information about the death of his mother, but to no avail, as he disposes of Dalton and rushes off after he is informed by C.C. that Nunnally has been kidnapped (how she found out, I don't know), shocking The Black Knights as he gives command to Todoh.\nAlso, turns out that a while prior, the Britannians were using their data from their experiments on C.C. to try to revive Jeremiah with a cyborg body. You know, while people complain about this being a typical \"Studio Sunrise bringing someone back from the dead\" moment, this is honestly one of the better instances. They actually try to give a somewhat plausible explanation this time around unlike in, say, Gundam SEED, where someone is caught in the explosion of his mech and he is just missing an eye and an arm while his wife is dead. Sure, it does weigh down on our suspension of disbelief a good bit, but it's better than most of these kinds of instances. Now, in a new mech, he rushes off in a blazing fury to dispose of Lelouch, who tries to save Nunnally. Meanwhile, Lloyd's assistant Cecile, frees Suzaku, and he chases after Lelouch as well. Seeing this, Kallen follows suit.\nThis, we have reached the finale, which is one of the most epic cliff-hangers in history. During the last dew episodes, Nina was building something as a form of revenge. Now, she is in a mech, with the device in hand, and SHE THREATENS TO NUKE THE GODDAMN SCHOOL IN THE NAME OF EUPHEMIA!!! I mean, JESUS!! As if we weren't on the edge of our seats enough with the battle and how the school is raided! Part of what makes this so effective is the rule of 3's, with that crazy masturbation scene setting us up to her going crazy over Euphemia, to her nearly getting run over as the reminder, all the way to this fucked up payoff. Elsewhere, C.C. drops Lelouch off so she can deal with Jeremiah, but as soon as he enters, both Kallen and Suzaku enter, with Suzaku shooting him in the head, cracking the mask. The identity is revealed, much to Kallen's horror and Suzaku's disappointment. Lelouch tries to bargain with Suzaku one last time in order to help rescue Nunnally, but Suzaku ain't having any of that, denounces the value of his existence, ad the two scream at each other, threatening to shoot each other, and then BAM!!! The biggest cliffhanger of the new millennium! I'm willing to be they it was totally worth the 1 and 1/2 year wait, partially due to how much most people would grow to love R2.\nSorry for dragging this out for so long, but I needed to go in depth into addressing most of the strengths and weaknesses of the show, as well as obliterate the most common criticisms of the show. Sad thing is, I could've gone in even deeper, but that would be filler at this point. The rest of the review won't be as long. I promise, though that isn't saying much thanks to what's coming up next.\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\nLelouch is easily one of the most charismatic protagonists of all time, as well as a very interesting and complex one. His silver tongue comes in handy as he pulls of some impressive stunts with the level of theatric acting to rival a Shakespearean play. Sure, he has the hilarious running gag of bring so weak that even I could kick his ass, but you don't wanna mess with this guy once he dawns the mask. His hatred of the Royal Family is very believable, as after his mother died, his father kicked both him and his sister out to a war zone, and nobody batted an eye. As a tactician, he is genuinely great despite having to make some darker calls that put him in anti-hero territory, until his emotions get in the way in the fashion that is fitting for an emotional teenager like him, which is his fatal flaw that causes him to be put under horrible situations like erasing Shirley's memory after she is emotionally torn apart by Mao after  seeing his identity, and Nunnally (who I already mentioned is mainly a character meant to provide some humanity to our favorite anti-hero) being kidnapped. Yet, that was oddly the best thing that could've happened. If he and Kallen had stayed, not only would they both be wasted by Suzaku and especially Jeremiah, but then both of them would reduce The Black Knights to rubble anyway.\nOh, lordie. Suzaku Kururugi. We're not supposed to like him per se, but still, man do we really grow to hate the bastard by the end of this. He initially seems like a nice guy despite joining the Britannians to help change them (which, more often than not, is beyond ineffective, as shown here), after all, he managed to woo the benevolent Princess Euphemia, but then we get the truth. Remember the war from 7 years prior? His father, Genbu Kururugi died. It was him who did it, but everyone covered it up for the sake of Japan. This guy has basically tried to be the best guy ever in order to try to forgive himself for that mistake, and we genuinely feel his struggle to suppress it once it gets brought up again. Thing is, the boy's a total hypocrite, always slamming Zero for doing something that he himself is always doing: fighting a war in the name of peace. Luckily, that's why he's an antagonistic rival, as he's called out for this a lot and is meant to be seen in a negative light for his hypocrisy. He has this arc of trying to put it past him and eventually coming to accept that he is a murderer, and, while his arc doesn't end here, at least he acknowledges how far he is starting to go once Euphemia dies, even if he only becomes a blood-thirsty hypocrite. A lot of Knights such as this aptly named white knight were bloodthirsty hypocrites during the age of the mideval crusades, as portrayed in King Arthur.  Then again, Code Geass has a tone of references to King Arthur and mideval times as a whole, and I'll leave a link to a review from a good buddy of mine that delves into this way better than I ever could, down below.  People often accuse this stores of not really capitalizing on the moral rivalry between Lelouch and Suzaku, but ultimately, this was just a farce since this was the only really logical way to showcase both of their ideologies without really stopping to insulting or intelligences by glorifying a hypocrite, unlike say, Gundam SEED and Destiny with how they glorified Kira.\nThe Black Knights are overall pretty decent too. Fueled by his brother's death and her mother's subjugation and subsequent drug addiction, Kallen is ruthless towards the Britannian army, and she develops a bit as she understands her mother's pain and as she falls deeply in love with Zero. She is a badass and beautiful warrior with these two funny running gags of being put in awkward situations and her hating Britannians. Ohgi is a reasonable person who is generally much kinder than his compatriots, seeing as he saved Villetta, her memory not withstanding. This leads to a big problem as he needs to take care of her while making sure nobody finds out. This bites him in the ass. Tamaki is annoyingly dumb and aggressive, and he is often shot down because of it. Todoh is a badass general with the sweetest looking mech, but is one of the more plain people here. \nC.C. is a much more conniving and assholish woman, moreso than Lelouch himself, with her pissing him off a lot despite their contract. Another beautiful mistress (this series has a lot of them), and with the running gag of ordering Pizza (which makes it even funnier once the giant pizza she wanted was set flying into a tree. \"Pizza...\") and the surprisingly tragic side of her, she is one of the most engrossing characters in the show. An interesting thing to mention is the scene where she kisses Lelouch. Some people take this as her confessing love to him but given her character before and after and even the circumstances of the moment, it comes off as more of her purposely trying to motivate him the best way a sexy woman can motivate a straight teenage man, especially since she never shows any real affection for him.\nThe classmates aren't spectacular on their own, but the humor provided is genuinely charming. Rivalz adds nothing but that, so it makes sense to exploit that for all it's worth, in scenes where that kind of tone belongs. Milly is much more boisterous, bordering on obnoxious for certain characters due to her playful attitude and her always trying to get some dirt on Lelouch (as well as everything involved with the cat chase in episode 6), but she does have restraint. I've seen a lot of hate for Shirley, and while she isn't one of the better characters here, I don't see where the hate is coming from. Especially after she goes through so much emotional pain in a short amount of time due to Mao sadistically using her actions ands thoughts from episodes 11-13 to drive her to kill Lelouch. Even after getting her memory back after Lelouch erased it for her sake, she remained loyal to him 'til the end. With Nina, I can definitely see the hate. She is xenophobic (to distressing degrees on her end), and once Euphemia saves her, the obsession begins. She ends up humping table-kun in one of the most infamous and uncomfortable moments in the series, and once Euphemia dies, she flips out, going as far as to threaten to nuke the school in hatred for what Zero did to Euphie. I mean, when you have Lloyd worriedly saying \"OH, HELL!!\", something is wrong with you.\nSpeaking of Lloyd, he is an absolute blast! He steals every scene he's in with his emotionally detached and eccentric attitude. He often jokes about Suzaku's moral dilemmas, and any situation the Britannians are in. She regards Suzaku as a component for the Lancelot, and brushes off any attempts Cecile makes of informing him of his lack of social decency, so much so that she grabs him by the collar with cold fury when he jokes about Suzaku and his self contradiction in episode 19 in one of the funniest scenes in the show. His bewildered and jealous rage as his cohorts perfect the system he wanted to perfect is glorious, and so is lack of restraint. Cecile is his moral anchor but gets shut down every time in humorous dialogue from Lloyd. She does get a cool moment of freeing Suzaku in the finake, but isn't one of the more notable characters here.\nCharles is a despicable and callous mofo, despite not getting much screen time. No wonder Lelouch hates him. Clovis doesn't have much to him aside from being more of an actor type of prince, and making tons of paintings of the family. Euphemia is basically the benevolent figure of the family, but she's not afraid of kicking someone's ass if its for someone she cares about. Too bad Lelouch geass flips out and she is tearfully forced to kill the Japanese, leading to her death, which is one of the saddest deaths I've seen to date, especially coupled with the Japanese cursing her name while Suzaku lies by saying that her plan was a success. Cornelia is very protective of her sister, but is as callous to the Japanese as the rest of the family, sans Euphemia. As for Schneizel, he is much more composed and compassionate than the rest, which is proven to be true when he watches in horror as Euphemia kills the Japanese. Still, he makes as many dark calls as Lelouch, and given that Lelouch and Nunnally talk about him being the only one Lelouch never beat in chess, we know that he'll be a force to be reckoned with in season 2.\nJeremiah Gottwald, aka Orange Boy, becomes more eccentric as time goes on and his reputation is eradicated by Zero. He is a walking, talking ham, a total dank meme machine, and it follows all the way into season 2. Villetta isn't amazing, but I like how much happier and gentler she is after episode 13 due to the mind loss, which makes it more crazy when she reverts back due to her memory coming back. Diethard is mainly here with the Black Knights brcause he loves the theatrics involved with their schemes and wants to be there to film their revolution. Sayako, Lelouch's maid, is alright as well, but her standout moment is yet to come. And, that covers every single notable character in this show. Quite the crazy repertoire we got here. Still, it's pretty cool that such a large cast gives us some of the most memorable characters in anime history, for better or worse, since not many shows with large casts can do that, at least without their memorable characters being notably hated.\nART: 9/10\nStudio Sunrise was the main team in charge of production here. There are a few dips in character models and a few odd art moments in the first half, but that all but disappears in the second half. The Knightmare Frame mech designs are sweet as hell, and are all toy worthy; the Lancelot, Gawain, Guren Mk.II, and whatever Todoh has, all of them and other sick ass Knightmare Frames. The character designs were done by the mangaka group CLAMP, and, while these might turn some people off, I really like the style, especially when the mouths and facial expressions get to be so exaggeratedly expressive that it borders on funny. The fights are well done as well, especially with the Bebop-level shading done in the final few episodes. The OPs, namely 2 and 3 do have a lot of recycled animation, which sucks, but I like that 1 and 2 have 2 versions meaning that they change up the OP animation here and there. I especially love how in every action from the Knightmare axles violently skidding the ground to the weird projectile harpoons firing, they employ sparks to add to the realism of the mechs, which are probably the most realistic that a humanoid shaped combat mecha can get. This adds a lot of weight to every single action made by these Knightmares, adding so much to the combat of this show as each well-animated blow or axle drop hits even harder.\nSOUND: 9/10\nOP 1, \"COLORS\" by FLOW, is quite a catchy and memorable OP, which is why it has earned its status as one of the most popular OPs of all time. People rag on OP 2 \"Kaidou Funou\" by Jinn, a lot, but personally, I enjoy it. Not as much as OP 1, but still. OP 3, \"Hitomi no Tsubasa\" by Access, is quite a catchy sendoff OP to the season, despite the lack of animation present. ED 1 \"Yuukou Seishunka\" is one of Ali Project's better songs, and is pretty alright. ED 2, \"Mosaic Kakera\" by SunSet Swish, is a pretty catchy ED all things considered.The rest of the OST was done by Kentarou Nakagawa, and he does a great job, even if most if the standouts only appear in the last 5 episodes. Said standouts being: \"Previous notice\" (the next episode preview theme), \"0\", \"Cold Nobility\", \"Picaresque\", \"The Black Knights\", \"Innocent Days\", and \"Callin'\". I could still list a good few more tracks and I might even make a playlist blog for them since I love this gigantic OST so much, but I think you get the picture. It's slick and hype as hell, really working in favor with some of the cooler moments in the show, as well as numbing the pain of worse moments, which is always a bonus, a bonus that no doubt carries over to R2.\nThe dub is one of the best ever made, especially for the late 2000's. Johnny Yong Bosch, Steve Blum, Crispin Freeman, Yuri Lowenthal, Liam O'Brienm, and plenty of others do an amazing job with their roles, with these 5 men mentioned above as the standouts for their roles as Lelouch vi Brittania, Todoh, Jeremiah Gottwald, Suzaku Kururugi, and Lloyd Asplund respectively. Even the background voices are great. I mean, Patrick Seitz is here as a bunch of one off nobodies and he still is a joy to listen to. Nobody here does a bad job, even if some moments aren't as well acted as others. Still, nobody gives a bad performance here, not even remotely, and it culminates in an amazing dub with plenty of memorable and even quirky lines that we've been quoting for almost a decade now. When you can pull all that off sincerely, you have yourself a wonderful dub.\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\nMan, what a fun show! I can't help but gush over it, it's just so fucking cool; Gurren Lagann cool! Overall, I think episodes 4, 23, and 25 were the standout episodes of the show for me among many other already kickass episodes, delivering some of the franchise's most glorious moments that left me grinning as much as Diethard did in episode 4.The humor was always on point, leaving me laughing on multiple occasions. Even with the complaints I have about this show, not only was my enjoyment not often affected thanks to all of the epic ness surrounding everything, but even when they did, it's not like it was very severe unlike most shows I have huge qualms with. When you get right down to it, Code Geass is a very exciting and captivating show from beginning to end, episodes 9 and 22 not withstanding. When I can get that engrossed in such a flawed series, you know you've hooked me into something I'll never forget, which is probably why I still consider this show to be my favorite anime to date in terms of appreciation and experience.\nOVERALL: 9/10    RAW SCORE: 88/100  \nIf there was one word to describe this show, It would be charismatic. From its protagonist to its music and events, this show tries to woo you like no other would. Sure, it hits hard into the comedy and tragedy, but when it reels you in, it really reels you in. Despite its flaws, it wants you to have a good time. With superb audiovisual directing, all of its biggest moments are as glorious as can be, and the next episode previews are directed so well that they managed to advertise a comedy episode as one to be hyped for. It's not perfect, oh hell no, but it wows me with how it presents itself, like that one gentleman at prom night with a few holes in his suit, who wants to treat his special lady with a good time with his charismatic attitude and impressive moves. Well, it's been a long one, but the revolution ain't over yet. With all that said, I bid you adieu.\nLovaloo's Geass analysis and how King Arthur and mideval times in general both tie heavily into the themes and life blood of the show itself: https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=246809\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=27, ["text"]="\n                          \n    Let me preface this by saying this is the fourth time I've watched Code Geass, and it never fails to impress.  I'm also well aware of the many reviews attacking the show for its alleged defects, often going out of their way to tear it apart based upon questionable criticisms instead of offering a sincere assessment on the merits.  I can only surmise that the bulk of these are the product of the counterculture phenomenon: the series is so popular and mainstream that it must suck.  Obviously I disagree, and I'll do my best to explain why.\nCode Geass starts with a great,\n          \n        deceptively original premise.  The world is at war.  Its sole superpower, the Holy Britannian Empire, has recently conquered Japan using advanced weaponry known as the Knightmare Frame.  Lelouch, a well to do, perpetually aloof boy living in the Tokyo Settlement, escapes his otherwise dull life by beating nobles in high-stake chess games, until the day that he is caught up in a fight between the colonial government and pro-Japanese terrorists, meets a mysterious green-haired girl named C2, and is given the power of Geass (in his case, the power to order anyone to obey his command).  War, mechas, and special powers are nothing to sneer at, even if stories incorporating these elements are a dime a dozen.  Yet Code Geass stands out in its ability to infuse richness and depth into virtually every element and central character of the story.  The war isn't just about land - it's about political philosophy.  Britannia, by far the most powerful, nationalist, and aggressive of the world's political powers, is also the most morally deplorable, founded upon racial superiority, economic inequality, and the principle that the strong should devour the weak.  The European Union and Chinese Federation, by contrast, choose to grant equal rights or equal wealth to their citizens, but are consequently weak. \nNor is Lelouch some random guy who gets special powers and decides to become a terrorist.  Besides being one of the best and most complex male protagonists in the last decade, he is an outcast prince of Britannia who despises its philosophy and the Emperor because both deny the worth of his crippled sister Nunnally.  Through his alter ego, Zero, he seeks to destroy the world through virtually any means so that he may rebuild it anew.  Suzaku, Lelouch's best and yet worst friend and pilot of the invincible Lancelot, isn't just some trite rule follower, either.  He is driven by his own dark past to believe that no good can come to oneself or others from an end attained by wicked means.  C2 has her own complex history and a soul tempered by an existence outside of time.  In her most candid and beautiful moment, she explains that her real name is all she remembers, and so she goes by C2 to ensure that it may only be spoken with tenderness, honesty, and affection.  A number of characters beyond the main cast are also remarkably well-developed: Kallen, who leads a double-life as a Britannian student and terrorist and fights to give meaning to her brother's death and mother's life; the deliciously ruthless Cornelia, who presents a formidable challenge to Zero's plans; the maniacal Jeremiah Gottwald, aka Orange Boy, whose devotion to the Crown causes him to lose his very humanity; and Euphemia, the sweetest, kindest, and most tragic character a mecha anime has ever seen. \nBeyond incredible, dynamic characters, Code Geass offers a superb story with perfect pacing and an endless supply of suspense and emotion.  From the first episode, when Lelouch narrowly escapes death using his newfound Geass powers by ordering the Britannian soldiers to kill themselves, I was completely hooked, and things never let up.  While the plot is initially and ultimately about the conflict between the Black Knights and the Britannian government, there are some nice subplots that enrich the main story: Suzaku's rise within the Britannian military and incessant ability to thwart Lelouch's efforts; Shirley's internal struggles; C2's past; the origins of Geass; and the Emperor's obscure plans for the world.  Underlying the story are two philosophical questions, one common albeit well executed, the other quite novel - Can revolution be justified if it requires sacrificing the lives and happiness of others (i.e., can the ends justify the means), and if so, who should bear the blame for the consequences?  The conclusion is also one of the best of any anime.  True, it's the biggest cliffhanger ever and had I been watching during the initial broadcast I would have gone into a fit of rage, but it manages to create one of the most emotional moments I've ever seen, and it ensured viewers would be back for the second season.\nFortunately the studio realized it had a great story and went all out on the animation, soundtrack, and voice casting to make this a top-notch production.  The character designs in particular are stunning, with facial expressions that often bring them to life (see especially Cornelia when she goes mad).  The soundtrack is essentially as good as it gets without hiring Yoko Kanno, featuring a mesh of classical tracks with an imperial flavor (e.g., Noblesse Oblige), beautiful symphonies (e.g., Boyhood), jazzy trumpet pieces (e.g., Pessimistic Time), and a couple of amazing Hitomi tracks (e.g., Stories).  The voice cast is essentially as good as it gets (no qualifier), featuring Johnny Yong Bosch (Lelouch) in probably his best performance, Kate Higgins (C2), and an exceptional fit and performance by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn (Cornelia). \nAlright, so at this point I sound like a fanboy foaming at the mouth, which is partly accurate.  But I like to be fair, so I'll close with the few things I did not like about Code Geass.  First, and most critically, there are a few times when things line up too perfectly.  Eye contact, for instance, is occasionally an area where Lelouch takes a huge gamble and gets lucky.  Episode 22 also borders on unbelievable, but is ultimately acceptable because a foundation is established earlier on.  Second, events accelerate a bit too much in the final 3 episodes and one more episode would have been nice to spread things out.  Finally, I don't like Nina (mainly because of her voice) and I can't stand Tamaki.  \nObviously those are minor criticisms that had little effect on my opinion of the show, and try as I might, I can't think of any others.  Really I'm sure I could add more reasons that I love it, but this review has gone on too long already.  Put simply, Code Geass is a masterpiece, and at least for now, it's the gold standard by which I review new anime.\n        "},
			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=26, ["text"]="                          \n    This is a long, detailed review so congrats if you can make it to the end.\nStory 8:The series takes place in an alternate universe where Japan has been conquered by the “Holy Britannian Empire”, the world’s only superpower. Under Britannian rule, the native Japanese have been subjected to a cruel and oppressive foreign rule. At the heart of the conflict is the protagonist, Lelouch, who is a Britannian prince who hates the Empire. The story begins when he receives a special power from a mysterious girl. \nWhat I appreciated most about the story was the moral complexity and ambiguity. Nothing is clear cut and everyone\n          \n        (who survives) undergoes a significant character change. It’s one of those morally grey narratives where it’s hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys. Britannia is an evil empire, yes. I mean they ruthlessly execute Japanese civilians and their soldiers follow orders like Nazis, yet many of the series’ most likeable characters are Britannian students/citizens. The Japanese resistance on the other hand may stand for a noble, underdog cause, but they conduct terroristic bombings and execute Britannian hostages too. Ok, so who’s the “good guy”? If that’s an answer you need to have then this is not the anime for you.\nThe story is exciting and engaging and it definitely does a good job combining action with strategy and intrigue. \nCharacters 9: It’s rare and great when you have an anime that has exciting and well-developed characters along with a very cool plot. Often you have to choose between one or the other…or neither. Code Geass has both. The characters are complicated and don’t follow typical anime clichés.\nOne of the predominant themes that keeps surfacing is the challenge of fighting evil without becoming evil. \nI’m reminded of a famous quote from Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s Gulag Archipelago (which I was coincidentally reading at the time I watched this anime): \n“If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?”\n The protagonist, Lelouch, embodies this good/evil dichotomy. He is intelligent, self-righteous, ambitious, vicious and powerful. The viewer can’t help but respect him and his obsessive, driven personality. However, this admiration becomes progressively more uncomfortable for the viewer as Lelouch’s hands become bloodier and bloodier in his quest to eradicate the evil empire of Britannia. Can one fight evil without becoming corrupted? Is it wrong to kill in the name of a righteous cause? Are people guilty by association? What are the dangers of seeing the world in black and white? These are some of the questions that are explored in Lelouch’s journey and (in my humble opinion) allow the anime to transcend just being a cool story and, instead, give it some philosophical depth. \nWhile Lelouch is the centerpiece, he is surrounded by very interesting characters too. And while these co-mains and supporting characters serve to give Lelouch more complexity, they are also very interesting and unique in their own right.\nFor example, when CC is rude or unreasonable it’s not part of some cutesy tsundere flirtation scheme…no, no, sometimes she can just be a major bitch…which is delightful to watch. Then there’s Suzaku, who I disliked at first for being a one of those over-powered, one-dimensional, annoying, simple-minded, pure-hearted idealists that pop up in anime so frequently, but even he turned out to be more complicated and flawed than I gave him credit for. And of course there’s Shirley, Episode 1: just the cheerful, preppy bimbo; Episode ???— Think again, she’s complicated too. Haha, I guess a good way to sum it up is that everyone in this anime has issues, which makes them interesting. And it’s through these unique characters that we get to see the different facets of Lelouch.\nArt 9: the art is beautiful, from the action sequences to the futuristic/Victorian scenery to the characters themselves. The animation takes a very strange approach to depicting the human body. I noticed that most of the characters have very androgynous body frames and are usually tall and oddly slender. In faraway shots people look almost like well-drawn scarecrows. This isn’t good or bad but it’s unique. What’s not unique though is the absolutely shameless product placement. In an alternate universe where Britain rules the world, battles are fought using mechs and where magical powers shape the course of global events, only one thing remains constant…Pizza Hut. That’s right, kids eat Pizza Hut. CC eats it in 90% of the scenes she in and still manages to maintain that slender figure I was talking about earlier. And despite Pizza not even being Japanese or British, Pizza Hut still shows up on buildings, in parties, on desks and even as a password during a crucial moment. I was seriously waiting for the Mechs to start entering battles with NASCAR-style Pizza Hut logos slapped on their guns.  \nSound 8: Catchy intro but not my favorite. None of the other music stood out in a big way for me.\nCritiques: \nAt some point, every 17+ anime has to answer the simple question of how wrong is it to kill someone. Compare Elfen Lied and Psycho-Pass. Both are dark shows but Elfen Lied put very little moral weight on the masses of people Lucy slaughtered, and even portrayed her as a misunderstood and sympathetic character. Whereas, in Psycho-Pass, despite a great deal of violence and moral ambiguity, the death of a single anonymous person is still treated as something horrific, evil and thought-provoking. Code Geass is inconsistent and they kind of swing back and forth. Sometimes they’ll explore the psychological effects of a single death on different characters, but other times these same characters kill without so much as an afterthought and go on with their merry lives. I would have preferred more moral consistency. \nSatisfaction/Overall 9: I was very satisfied with the first season. I'm looking forward to season 2.\nBlood/gore: There is some. It’s not stylized or overdone but they are also not afraid to show death and violence. \nLove/Romance: Lelouch develops special connections with a couple of girls throughout the series but the focus isn’t on developing a particular romance. As I said earlier, different characters = different sides of Lelouch and he’s able to interact with each of these girls in a different way. Likewise, these girls each see something different in him. I know it sounds weird but we bypass, a lot (but not all) of the jealousy/love-triangle/harem stuff despite everyone going to the same school. In my opinion, this is largely because these girls see Lelouch’s obsession with achieving his goal (rather than each other) as their greatest rival.\nSex/nudity: While there’s a fair amount of fan service in the form of “whoops, I didn’t realize I was naked”, there were a few (usually non-graphic) ‘mature situations’ where I had to ask myself what the fuck did I just hear/see? Seriously Nina, wtf…"},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=26, ["text"]="\n                          \n    With striking character designs, adrenaline inducing pacing and epic battles, Code Geass is basically a versing in making exciting, highly watchable shounen anime.\nPlot-10/10\nMy highest score would undoubtedly have to be for the plot of Code Geass. It immediately gives an interesting premise: Japan has became a social darwinist state, ran by the xenophobic britannians who dub it \"Area 11\". The Britannians are shown to be cruel and racist: their actions in the first episode of the anime is enough to get us on the side of Lelouch. The anime, thankfully, does not divert too much from the original plot. There are only really two or\n          \n        three episodes that are not totally pivotal to the outcome of the anime, and these are important as they divulge some of the secrets of Lelouch's new found powers. The pacing is fantastic: for someone like me, who has a hatred of filler episodes, the plot was concise and steady, it did not diverge in to useless flashbacks or mini-arcs. Code Gass works just as well as a drama as it does as an action movie: the interactions between characters are just as interesting as the mecha scenes. In fact, Code Geass does not behave like a stereotypical gundam series at all: at times, I forgot that this was a giant robot anime-it is far more Death Note than Gundam Suite.\nCharacters-8/10\nMost of these points are solely for Lelouch-one of the most three dimensional anime characters I have seen for a long shot. Sure, he is supposed to be a genius, but he is a relatable one at that: he makes enough mistakes for the viewer to see him as a human being, rather than something invincible. Despite comparisons to Light Yagami, for me Lelouch does not tread in to \"despicable anti-hero\" territory: he is driven by his love of his family, and in fact, his empathy with others often prevents him from fulfilling his plans to their full extent. Lelouch is a true deconstruction of the \"infallible badass\" character: his flaws make him likeable and it is not hard to root for him as he dotes on Nunally.\nCode Geass has a massive cast, and due to this, many are pretty 1D. But the characters that are fleshed out properly make an interesting bunch: Karen is a total action girl from the start, Euphie makes for a realistic beautiful princess, with enough flaws to not fall into Mary sue category. Suzaku is believable as Lelouch's counterpart: He has a massive guilt complex, and turns out to be not all that he seems: he is basically a breakdown of the classic mecha pilot.\nArt-9/10\nClamp's character designs are gorgeous. I was initially a little bit thrown by the noodle like proportions of the cast, but give it time! Eventually your eyes will adjust to the anatomical weirdness. The characters were certainly all very different: the beautiful attention to detail in clothes, hair and eyes make this series a cosplayer or fanartist's dream. The striking differences in each member of the cast made it easy to tell who was who, essential in an anime that features so many people. \nThe backgrounds were pretty standard fare, as were the giant robots. But the obvious nod to Victorian style and architecture gave the series a feel unique to typical mecha and also fitted the essence of the ostentatious Britannian rulers.\nSound-8/10\nI watched the subbed version, so all this will refer to the original Japanese.\nNo real complaints here. Lelouch's voice actor was awesome, and his changes in tone were excellent in showing the differences between Lulu and Zero. I thought Nanally's voice was adorable. The differences in chosen pronouns were pretty interesting: Lelouch uses \"ore\", Suzaku uses \"boku\", Euphie talks using the extremely formal \"Watakushi\". It's practically worth learning a bit about Japanese pronouns before watching as these nunances make such a nice touch. The creepy gospel music that plays during fight scenes wasn't dissonant to the general atmosphere of the fights, and suited it quite nicely actually. The rest of the background music went unnoticed. \nThere are two different ops: the first one was a standard shounen op, the second seemed to be from the Blink 182 of Japan. I thought the ending songs were actually better: the first one is a real challenge for any karaoke fans, the second stays in the head all day.\nEnjoyment-9/10\nCode Geass is enjoyable as it doesn't pretend to be something that it's not: sure, it has a crazy plot, everyone has neon hair and school boys piloting giant robots doesn't even turn heads. But that's the fun in it! Anime is supposed to be pure escapism, something often forgotten by those craving more and more realistic plots. As soon as you let go of any pretensions, Code Geass becomes a very fun ride indeed: it is bright, with many twists and turns and leaves you with a feeling of satisfaction when it's finished.\n"},
			{["score"]=7, ["helpful"]=26, ["text"]="                          \n    **SPOILER FREE REVIEW OF BOTH SEASONS OF THE SHOW**\nThere is nothing that I enjoy more than a well-written, intellectually stimulating anime; they are by far my favorite kind of show to watch. Evangelion, for example, is one of my favorite anime of all time. Before watching Code Geass, I was told that it would fall into that same sort of boat and that it would entertain me while making me think simultaneously. While it certainly entertained me and I enjoyed it quite a bit, I would like to make it clear that this is not what I would call an intellectual anime, not even to\n          \n        the same extent as its oft-compared counterpart \"Death Note\". Let's be honest here; at its core, Code Geass is still a show about giant robots fighting each other in a battle where the biggest and best one wins (*cough, White Knight, *cough). It's overly theatrical, can be pretentious at times, and has a few inconsistencies with its plot… But I still love it for what it is.\nStory: 8/10\nSynopsis: A boy named Lelouch is secretly the long lost heir to the Holy Brittanian Empire; a planetary superpower who rules over inferior countries with tyranny and an iron fist using advanced robotic technology called \"Knightmares\". Lelouch was exiled from his homeland and sent to live in Japan, which has basically been turned into a Giant ghetto under the rule of the Empire who look down on the Japanese and treat them as sub-human. Lelouch holds a harsh grudge against his father, the King, who exiled him, and so he vows to destroy his father's mighty empire.\nHow much you enjoy the story-line of Code Geass really relies on how seriously you take it. To elaborate on that, here is an example of what I mean: In the very first episode, Lelouch receives the power of \"Geass\", a power that allows him to bind anyone to his will and gives him the power to order anyone to do anything he wants. With a power such as that, it is inevitable that a few plot-holes arise. There are a few shortcuts that Lelouch could have taken using his power which he should have been able to figure out since he is portrayed as such a genius, but Geass luckily is able to avoid any show-wrecking plotholes and keeps them all relatively minor.\nAnyway, the main strength of Geass' plot is that it simply knows how to get an audience invested in a story; it is written very, very well considering what they were going for. The writers were able to grip the audience from the very first episode and keep them on the edge of their seat for nearly the entire remainder of the show. \nCode Geass deserves a lot of credit for focusing far more on the strategy and tactics of mecha battles rather then the fighting itself, which is one of the show's most redeeming qualities. At least, that is the case for the first season. The second season gets away from its roots bit and starts to divulge to the \"Build a better robot! Beat the bad guys using brute force!\" kind of story which is far less interesting. For that reason, I would definitely say that the middle part of season 2 is the worst stretch of the storyline.\nHowever, it is certainly worth mentioning that Code Geass has an absolutely fantastic ending. Probably my favorite anime ending of all time. It can only be described using the far overused term, \"epic\". I wouldn't dare spoil it, but I truly wish that other anime would have the balls that Geass has in regards to not being afraid to risks in their storytelling.\nSo in conclusion, despite it's minor flaws, the big picture is that Code Geass' plot is impressively written and centered around a fantastic protagonist with supremely entertaining plot twists and an indescribably good ending. If you can look past the minor inconsistencies and the tendency for the show to over-exaggerate (which you should), you will have a blast watching Code Geass.\nArt: 8/10\nThe characters look great, the settings look great, and the action scenes are very well animated. For an anime released in 2006, these are some very quality visuals.\nSound: 8/10\nThe OST is definitely the best part about the sound, as it never fails to set the mood. It is used to over exaggerate not-so-exciting scenes a bit too often though. The openings and endings are alright, but none of them really stand out. The voice acting is above average in both the sub and the dub, so you can watch whichever you prefer.\nCharacters: 8/10\nThe characters in Code Geass are great overall, in my opinion. To the show's credit, they all have very specific traits that make them recognizable and distinct, but Geass can struggle with inconsistent character behavior at times as well as one or two characters that are just very poorly written. But for such a large cast, these things are bound to happen.\nLelouch vi Brittania, the protagonist, deserves mention for being a masterfully written, extremely complex character and one of the most notable anti-heroes in all of media; not just anime. You love him at times, you hate him at times, you are constantly intrigued with his motives, and you are always in awe of his actions. Lelouch is compared to Yagami Light from Death Note often because they are both geniuses who are constantly involved in a cat-and-mouse game and because it is unclear whether they are heroes or villains. However, I think the real reason Lelouch is such a fantastic character is the ending to the anime. Everything you didn't understand about him is elucidated, particularly his motivations. It is incredibly hard to decide throughout Code Geass whether Lelouch is a hero or a villain; has he gone mad with power or is he still a force for justice? Well, lets just say the last episode gives you your answer in an EPIC fashion . Lelouch is in the running for my favorite anime character of all time, and I am not alone in that regard.\nHowever, for every couple of great Code Geass characters, there is one who is not-so-great. CC , for example, is a character who is shrouded in mystery for a long time. She seems to add a lot to the anime at first with her level of intrigue, her unknown motivations, and her charm, but she receives little to no development  at any point in either season, and the little that she does receive is very shoddy. CC is giant wasted opportunity. Don't get me started on Nina either. *shudder\nThere are many more great characters to talk about, but I can't possibly go over all of them. In short, there are a few bad characters in Geass and there a few things about the good ones that don't make sense, but the majority of the cast is very, very well done and most importantly; memorable.\nOverall: 8/10\nIs Code Geass perfect? No, not by any means, but watching it is incredibly fun and you owe it to yourself as an anime fan to watch it all the way through, even if it's just to say that you have and don't like it. I was on the edge of my seat essentially the whole time, the characters were likable, and the story-line is well written for the most part. I highly recommend Code Geass to all ages.\n        "},

			{["score"]=5, ["helpful"]=26, ["text"]="\n                          \n    Code Geass. I don't really know what to say about it. On one side, It has a great story and Art. On the other side, nearly every character is a stereotype and not memorable at all. My biggest problem with Code Geass though, is the way it feels like 3 genres of animé thrown into a blender. Sometimes it's Action/Adventure and stuck to the plot, at other times It goes school comedy and harem. I would not really mind it, though it feels that only 40% of the episodes stick to the plot, and that's sure to annoy you. In fact, when I finished it,\n          \n        first thing that came to mind was how mediocre it was. I don't know why people keep comparing this mecha-wreck it to Death Note. I clearly recommend you pass on this\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=26, ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    First, for the sake of those who don't like reading much, I'll try to summarize what I can say about the anime in general.\nWhile may sound exaggerating, I would say this anime excels in almost everything. Even though the idea on which the anime based is pretty average and feels like a replica of other series, I assure you that everything about Code Geass is actually more unique and special than you think. \nThe simple idea of \"a boy receiving powers and executing revenge\" was taken to new heights in this epic anime. The plot of this series is most likely the most intelligent, unpredictable\n          \n        and fast-paced you'll ever see in your life. Predicting the plot of this anime isn't hard – it's impossible!\nIt moves so fast and has so many twists, that at some point you'll surely give up about predicting it and will simply enjoy it. \nThe characters in the anime, differently from most famous shonen series like Naruto, feel realistic. Most anime try to offer unique characters with many strange and interesting features. But when you look closely, you should notice that those characters feel unrealistic because they have awfully extreme characteristics, which you won't find in real people. In Code Geass, the characters are much more balanced and feel much more real, while still being very unique and different from each other. Another strong point about characters is their development. You will usually see how different characters deal with though decisions, and may eventually even change the side they are fighting for.\nThe animation of the series isn't something I can say much about. Personally, I like it. With that said, it's not my \"perfect\" style of art, and yet I have to admit it's a unique one. Rather than simply being \"good\" or \"bad', I think it's more about your taste. If it fits your taste – you like it, and if it doesn't – you don't. \nThe voice acting is really strong, especially for the main character – Lelouch. Since the anime focuses a lot about Lelouch's thoughts and decisions, the voice acting plays an important role in delivering the watcher his feelings and emotions. I think it was done beautifully in this anime. I could really feel how heavy each and every one of his decisions was, as well as how he felt before and after making the decision.\nThe music played a very important role as well, and like the voice acting – it fulfilled well its duty. Putting aside the action and tense moments, in which the music was great, I would rather focus on the tragic and dramatic moments. In these very plot-wise important moments, the music was simply perfect. Seeing the same moments without the music will make these moments simply \"another forgetful part of the plot\". But with the music, these very moments will most likely be the ones you'll remember the best after finishing watching the series.\n\n\nNow, for those who wish to read a more deep analysis about the series...\n\nPlot: The basic idea, which you most likely already read about somewhere, is \"Lelouch receives special power from a mysterious girl, and decides to use it in order destroy the Britannian Empire, both for revenge for his mother's death and to make a peaceful world for his sister\". You will most likely also see similar words over and over when watching the beginning of each episode. It's hard to believe there are many people who read such description and say \"this anime gonna be epic!\". I doubt if there are any at all. And I can't blame them, because it really sounds like a pretty average and simple idea. But the strength of Code Geass isn't hidden in this basic idea, but rather in the way its plot was executed. A basic plot pattern for the idea will be something like this: \"Lelouch and his organization fight against the evil commanders of the Britannian Empire and defeat them. At some point, the evil \"final boss\" arrives and Lelouch defeats him as well. Happy ending. Credits. Bye bye\"\nThat's what I believe most people would expect from this anime, and I was no exception. At the beginning, it really feels like it's going to follow this plain pattern. But very soon, after watching a few episodes, you'll realize that Code Geass's plot is nothing as simple as that. To start with, there is no even      \"Good vs. Evil\" in this series. You can't simply classify the characters and the different organizations in the series as either \"good\" or \"evil\". If I had to pick, I would rather say that the main character himself is actually \"evil\". But the most important thing about the plot, is that there are many things which make the plot very complicated. The main character, Lelouch, has more to do than just \"fight against the empire\". He also has to make sure he hides his identity, act normally in front of his sister and friends, and most of all – to be a strong and reliable leader in order to make people believe in him and follow his orders. If you think these are trivial matters which has nothing to do with the plot – you are gravely mistaken. Each and every one of them affects the plot strongly at some point, and shows you that the plot won't go the way you thought it will. \nThe plot itself is very fast paced. You may not notice this at first, as it feels like things moving a bit slow at the beginning. But once you get to the main parts, you'll be flying trough the episodes, and be warned – you may not be able to stop. For me, the plot was the biggest source of entertainment in this anime. It just keeps on going and never stops to take a break. With each passing episode, my curiosity about \"what will happen next\" only grew bigger and bigger. I'll admit it – I got addicted to the plot of this series, and to the series as a whole.\n\nCharacters: Alongside with the great plot of this series, stands the amazing cast of characters. While the anime focuses a lot on the plot and on moving the story fast, it never forgets about character development. This anime has many characters, like most anime. What makes it different, and better in my opinion, is the balance of the characters. You won't see \"an idiot who shouts the whole day\" or \"a girl which hits everybody when she's angry\" type of characters. Every character has its own unique features, but in the same time they are all \"humans\". Which means that no matter what personality a character has, it'll never act in extreme or unrealistic way. Such balanced characters are easier to understand and to become attached to. \nAnother strong aspect of the characters is their \"state of mind\". You often see how different characters must make hard and heavy decisions, which will affect them or their surroundings in different ways. The main focus is on the main character, Lelouch, but many other characters also make important decisions in their life, like Lelouch's childhood friend – Suzaku. Every character has its own past, beliefs, wishes and values. Together, they affect the decisions of the characters, and usually even put them one against another. If you look at the battles in this anime, then you'll see they are mostly based on each person's beliefs. These aren't battles between \"good\" and \"evil\", but rather between what each character \"believes is right\". This adds a lot to the series, and doesn't allow you easily judge a character as \"good\" or \"evil\". Some people may say Lelouch is \"good\", while some may say he's \"evil\". Personally, I belong to the latter type. \nBut just like I said – they are humans. Every human sometime loses his way and falls into confusion and despair. You can see it perfectly in this anime. Many characters tend to become confused of what is \"right\" and what is \"wrong\" at some point. One event can totally change the character's personality, and to shake its beliefs and values. Some characters eventually even change the side they support and fight for. Your enemy in the beginning, may end up as your ally in the end and vice versa. If you ask what are the things that make this anime unpredictable, then this, without a doubt, is one of them.\n\nAnimation: Since the character design is done by Clamp, it's not strange to see how similar the art style between Code Geass and Clamp's manga, like X. The characters usually look tall and slim. That's how I always described Clamp's art style, and I think this description pretty much fit Code Geass. I'm a big Clamp fan. Not because of the art style, but because of their great ideas. This art style is pretty much unique to Clamp and you can either like it or not, depends on your own taste. Thus, it's hard for me to say that the art style is either \"good\" or bad\". Even though it's not my \"perfect\" type of art style, I still liked it a lot. I think that in term of quality, this anime was done well – no matter whatever you like the art style or not.\n\nSound: Since the characters are put trough different situation, the voice acting plays a very important role in this anime. If it's done well, then the watcher can understand well how complicated or tense the situations are. If done badly, then everything about the anime will feel shallow and boring.  \nI say it was done well. Very well.\nNotably is Lelouch's voice acting. No matter what the situation was, it was easy to understand it well thanks to the voice acting. Especially when Lelouch was lost or was making hard decisions, I could really understand how difficult and heavy these decisions were. Also, since Lelouch has more than one \"identity\", it was important that he'll feel different in every environment. He really felt like a fearless leader when he was on the battle field, but also as a carefree student when he was at school.\n\nMusic: It's always important to have a great music. Thanks to music, many events become better and more memorable. While the anime had great music during action scenes, I would rather focus on the music during sad and dramatic moments. In these very important moments, the music was perfect, beautiful and irreplaceable. It made those few moments the most memorable ones about the series. Even seeing them again, with this perfect music, will make you enjoy them almost as much as the first time. Without this perfect music, the same scenes just won't feel as great as they did.  \n\nEnjoyment: No matter how many things I say I liked about this anime, what really made it my favorite one is: that I really enjoyed it; and to enjoy is the most important, right?\nIt almost didn't have any boring parts. It was always active, and was moving forward without taking a break. It was unpredictable to a degree I have never seen before in a series, and I LOVE unpredictable things. Basically, the anime was very thrilling for me. It's like riding a roller coaster – once you start, you can't quit until it ends; but you don't regret it, because every moment was epic and thrilling.\n\nOverall: I recommend this anime to everyone. No matter what you think about it, and no matter whatever you think you won't like it – just try it. I was quite sure myself I won't like it. For me it was \"Robots? Who the hell is going to like an anime with big robots?\"\nThat was the reason it took me so much time to actually try this anime. But when I tried, I realized how stupid I was. It doesn't matter whatever there are robots or cliché base idea. What really matters is how well it was done, and how much you enjoyed it. "},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=21, ["text"]="\n                          \n    How many Code Geass reviews are there? I know, way too many. I think I have something a little different to say abut the show though, so bear with me. This functions as a spoiler-free review of both seasons of Code Geass.\nI'm a huge Code Geass fan. I've described it before as the crack cocaine of anime because there reached a point where if the series had been the same length as One Piece it would have ruined my life. My first run-through I was truly addicted. Now I'm well aware that the show is wildly popular already. I'm pretty sure I've seen Lelouch Lamprouge\n          \n        on more \"favorite character\" lists than anyone else. Any top list without Code Geass will undoubtedly be assaulted by enraged fans demanding why this worldwide phenomenon isn't #1 on everything. It almost seems as though Lelouch has used the power of the king on millions of people worldwide to make them swear undying loyalty to his show. Despite this, the show does take a lot of flack from more scrutinizing critics for its plot contrivances, unexplained magic powers, absurdly over-dramatic characters, ridiculous robot sequences, and the escalation of all of these things in the show's second season. If you're the kind of person that values thematic soundness or plot cohesiveness over all else, that places an emphasis on realism over cartoon mania, feel free to sink your teeth into Code Geass. It's not Utena and it's not Eva: as I see it, Geass has two major goals:\n1. To provide insight into the true nature of revolutionary leaders and what it entails to change the world, and to challenge its viewers to pursue an equally grand change.\n2. To entertain the fuck out of its viewers.\nI'm going to address the first one first. One of the things that makes Code Geass so compelling is Lelouch. Not in the sense that he's fun, though he is that, but in the sense that he is one of the most accurate reflections of the leader of a revolution or similar organization existing in fiction. People like Napoleon or Martin Luther King Jr. or even Ghandi are often drastically simplified by historical texts. People often take one of two sides: they side with the ideals of the person, or the criticize them for not being a perfect reflection of them or having alternative motives. In truth, these people are far more complex than that. Yes, they have ideals, and yes, they pursue them, but they are also human beings: they falter, doubt themselves, lose their way, have personal reasons for wanting to change a larger system. They do not behave in fully one-sided or rational ways, they are inconsistent, flawed, and confused. This is Lelouch. Lelouch breaks down the non-existent boundary between \"everyday people\" and people like Martin Luther King Jr, demonstrating that Lelouch is just as human as they are. Yes, he is an exceptionally intelligent person, but it doesn't take some genetic fluke or divine incarnation to change the world: it takes passion, determination, allies, timing: things that supposedly everyday people can have if they choose to embrace them. Lelouch initially strives to create the ideal world for Nunally, but realizes that he also legitimately wants to change the world because it's what he personally believes in as well. He claims to use people as pawns (such as Rolo) but he constantly demonstrates that he is not emotionally disconnected from them and can even alter his actions to selfishly protect those he cares about. He's neither a saint nor a martyr, and he's not asexual either (Lelouch semi-frequently demonstrates his hormonal urges, and whilst usually able to control them is not always the embodiment of chaste.) Lelouch shows that it takes more than just one brilliant mind to make a difference: all of Lelouch's allies are essential to his cause, furthering the point that just because you aren't Lelouch himself doesn't mean that you can't be an equally important part of the cause. Kallen is a far more talented nightmare pilot than Lelouch, and without her his tactics would be moot in the face of far-too superior forces. Diethard ensures that Lelouch's achievements do not go unnoticed: without publicity, his victories would be of minimal importance. Zero is an idea: he's not a person. The idea is pure, driven, resolute, refined. The people behind the idea are not. As individuals, they are messy, convoluted beings. But together they balance and complement each other and they come together to create the idea.\nCode Geass doesn't come up with any solutions to war or oppression or imperialism. From a political science aspect it's a trainwreck and its resolutions are completely unbelievable. But from a people aspect, it's informed and understanding. It's inspiring. It demands more from its audience, asking them how they want to change the world and what they can do to make that happen.\nNow, let's move on to part two.\nCode Geass is entertaining. What exactly do I mean by that? As far as I see it, there are three main elements that make Code Geass such a huge heap of fun to watch.\n#1. THE CHARACTERS\nCode Geass has an absolutely enormous cast. In the fifth opening they actually showcase all the ones that aren't dead yet and it takes up an entire chorus. Each and every one of these characters are about as colorful and over-the-top as possible. They're loud, expressive people. They love to give speeches, profess their emotions, espouse their ideals, engage in battles of philosophy, and move/pose in dramatic fashions. From Lelouch to Suzaku to Shirley to Kallen to Lloyd, everyone is memorable. Thanks to this it's an extremely engaging cast since you can remember everyone and a lot about them. These characters are extreme, and it makes them pop like a 3-D picture book. It's more than this, though: despite being absurd, the characters are also actually really good! They all get a lot of screentime, and this is extremely beneficial because we get to see how much most of them make sense: their motivations, their growth, changes, decisions and words all fall into place in a way that is extremely satisfying.\n#2. EMOTIONAL RESONANCE\nIf there's one thing I hate, it's stories trying to garner emotional investment through tragedy. You shouldn't have to make something horrible happen to your characters in order for me to care about them. Code Geass has plenty of tragedy but never ONCE does it rely on it. It packs an emotional punch because its characters actually grow and change drastically yet subtly, making the viewer feel as though they actually know them. This is because that's what it's like to be around actual people. They grow and change, and you don't always notice it at first but when you look back you realize it. It's because it's so effective at creating this bond between you and the characters that it doesn't need to rely on tragedy. Merely seeing the characters you care about in perilous situations creates intense investment, because the show also proves that it is not unwilling to kill them if that's what makes sense. This is the type of story where you don't care about characters because the die, you fear that they will die in the first place. One of the reasons that this is so effective is because Code Geass has a tangible sense of grounded conflict: there are tangible stakes in each battle, it is understood why the various sides are fighting, and the possibility of a variety of different outcomes feels very real. One thing that will forever stick with me is when a single poorly-timed joke from Lelouch results in Euphemia's horrific demise. It makes the show feel as though it's not glossing over the details: any small moment or decision could legitimately result in drastic repercussions.\n#3. THE ABSURDITY\nThis is the real kicker. This is where Code Geass truly shines. The show manages to smoothly transition between being completely serious and not seeming to give a f*ck. It's like what Akame Ga Kill was going for, but actually done right. It's not even two sides of the same coin: they're completely entwined. What I mean by absurdity should be pretty obvious: Pizza Hut product placement. Lucrative bombastic speeches by Lelouch. Nonsensical conversations about mech abilities that are never explained (super energy beam cannons! Increase to 200%! Activate the rearview legacy thrusters of doom!). Unexplained magic powers. The fact that no matter what, everything always comes back to the goddamn high school. Entire episodes dedicated to chasing a cat. This works so well because never ONCE does the show have the characters draw attention to it. There's no stupid anime humor. All the characters are always completely serious, and this contrasts against the nonsense of the world they live in PERFECTLY. A lot of people complain about the amount of mech mumbo-jumbo in the second season, but I thought that it fit perfectly. The second season had some of the show's most intense and serious moments, it seems only natural to juxtapose those against a backdrop of INSANITY. What the hell is the 'Mordred' and why does it shoot death lasers from its chest?? Why can all these robots suddenly fly?? Now there's nukes, energy shields, people that can stop time, see the future, and even a collective unconscious. This is like Gurren Lagann, people, except instead of having women as housewives and teachers it has them as nuclear physicists and front-line tanks. This is the kind of over-the-top nonsense I expected from a genre with as much potential as anime, but instead we get dumb slice-of-life shows that think they're funny. Code Geass absolutely nails down fun, often at its own expense, and that's something I completely respect it for.\nNow take that surreal absurdity, add emotional attachment and add amazing characters. Hilarious, shocking, creative, fast-paced, tear-inducing, epic, and just the right amount of over the top. That's Code Geass. That's what makes it so much goddamn fun. It's not some pseudo-intellectual nihilistic bullshit like Death Note, it's not idiotic slapstick comedy, it's dumb fun that also knows how to be good. It's both intelligent and stupid, and it absolutely works.\nLet's go back for a moment though, to purpose #1.\nThis is the part where I have no idea what the creators were intending. This is pure speculation. However, regardless of intentions, Code Geass does something that more shows could definitely aspire to emulate.\nIt has an impact.\nThrough its addicting nature and emotional staying power, Code Geass might be one of the easiest shows to get obsessed with. It's massively appealing, affecting millions of fans worldwide and permeating their hearts and souls. So naturally, they're going to listen to what it has to say. It's not the most complex message, but it's an important one nonetheless. The main point is, as I discussed earlier, that it has one. Because whatever the message of a show like Code Geass is going to be, people are going to hear it LOUD AND CLEAR. Take Revolutionary Girl Utena, for example. Brilliant commentary on the nature of sexism and social expectations in society, phenomenal use of symbolism, excellent insight into adolescence and the obsession with permanence and eternity created by a fear of death. Virtually non-existent fan base. Due to its repetitive and grinding nature, slow progression, abstract presentation and confusing execution, Utena is only going to reach a very small and dedicated audience. It's not going to make an impact on a wide population, it's not going to turn into any sort of gospel of the masses, it's not going to get its point across to anyone other than a select few. Which is a real shame, because it has a lot of important things to say. But, if Utena had adopted the same tactics as Code Geass: seeking to ENTERTAIN as well as make a point, striving to engage its viewers on a fun, intelligent AND thematic level, I GUARANTEE that we would be looking at a very different reception. That version of Revolutionary Girl Utena COULD bring about the world revolution, because people would listen. Code Geass makes people listen, and then it has something to say. That is the value of entertainment: what can be done with it. That's why I think Code Geass is so great. Because it is entertaining. Because it did manage to entertain me more than any other show to date. And because it was able to do something with that. Sure, the themes are incomplete and basic, but they're also important. Code Geass isn't as refined a revolution as Utena, but it's the one that's more likely to actually happen. \n        "},

During that time, I had no idea what it was or that it was even an anime. I soon started hearing more and more people talking about it and then read about it in my December 2007 edition of Newtype USA. I decided to check it out, since I had only heard good things about it. I went into watching the show having high expectations, and Code Geass did not let me down...\nStory- Code Geass' story is incredibly complex- not so much in a psychological or abstract way, but because there is\n          \n        always about fifty things going on at once, with over twenty characters to keep track of. This makes the show incredibly engaging and exciting to watch as you become entranced in its multifaceted storyline. The story line moves at an incredibly fast pace as well. There are no long gaps of staring people down *cough*Naruto*cough* and there are minimal scenes containing subject matter that is irrelevant to the plot. Even though this is a good thing for the most part (no boring scenes=win), the plot sometimes moves too fast for one to fully comprehend, giving it a somewhat rushed feeling. Nonetheless, Code Geass manages to turn a seemingly simplistic mehca plot revolving around a rebellion into a jam-packed roller coaster ride filled with a little bit of everything- political intrigue, comedy, adventure, suspense, action, drama, and even some ecchi- making for an eclectic plethora of different anime genres in one show. \nArt- Some excellent work by CLAMP here, although their artwork is usually quite high-quality. While toned-down colours may have been more suitable for Code Geass' intricate and somewhat dark plot, I felt that the vivid colours that were used throughout the anime added life and energy to the story. Animation was fairly decent as well. The fight scenes between the mechas could have been more detailed at times, but I'm not complaining. Everything was pretty slick and tight- it made for an entrancing display of exciting fight scenes, gorgeous settings, and unique character designs (I'm partial to C.C. <3)\nSound- Top-notch. Code Geass incorporates some wonderfully unique background music during a number of episodes that fits very nicely with the plot. These songs sometimes included some interesting female vocals as well which I enjoyed hearing during some of Geass' most intense action scenes. It made for some excellent juxtaposition between fast-paced action and relaxing/calm vocals. Sound effects were very appropriate to the story and none seemed to interrupt the flow of each episode. Opening and ending songs were outstanding as well. There were a variety of different genres of music involved in the show's opening and ending themes from the dissonant 'Kaidoku Funō' (2nd opening) to the more poppy 'Colors' (1st opening) to the trance-influenced 'Hitomi No Tsubasa' (opening for episode 24). Great range of musical genres and all are a pleasure to listen to.\nCharacter- There were a variety of well-developed characters in Code Geass. A few of them include Lelouch, a strategic mastermind who has sworn to enact revenge upon his irrational/totalitarianistic father; Suzaku, a kind-hearted boy who joined the army in order to promote peace in area 11 (Japan); and C.C., a very mysterious girl whose origins and motives are unknown. These are only 3 characters who grow and develop during the show. Countless other characters (including relateively minor characters) also encounter hardships, interact with others, and form unique bonds during the course of the anime. The fact that Code Geass manages to give adequate attention to such a wide array of characters in the course of a mere 25 episodes is quite impressive. One can relate to a good number of the characters in one form or another as well- whether it be Leouch's protective nature toward his sister or C.C.'s will to remain aloof and isolated from others out of fear of idscrimination or rejection- making them more relevant and realistic in the eyes of the viewer. \nEnjoyment- I quite enjoyed watching Code Geass. The storyline was detailed, well thought-out and incorporated some truly remarkable plots into the plot as well. Each episode left me wanting more; it was a rollar-coaster ride I couldn't help but want to ride again and again, and the line-up to wait for another seat on the ride was my computer that loaded each episode too slowly for the fast pace I wished to keep. Where does Code Geass fall short of a 10 then? For the most part, it's originality. In all honesty, we have seen this plotline many other times in other mecha series- one that kept coming to mind was Gundam Seed in particular- and the fact that a supernatural ability was thrown into the plot was strongly redolent of Death Note. Code Geass's plot line also left little room for the viewer to form his or her own theories or ideas of what actually or may have happened throughout the storyline. There was little room for viewer interpretation/extrapolation- something that actively engages me while I watch anime and also something that makes it all the more exciting to discuss with others. \nOverall- Code Geass was quite entertaining to watch and was definitely worth my time in the end. If you are looking for a thrilling anime that gets your adreneline pumping andleaves you with little room to catch your breath, look no further than Code Geass.  I look forward to seeing how R2 advances with the plot when I watch it in the future."},
			{["score"]=7, ["helpful"]=25, ["text"]="                          \n    To start off this review I should probably say right from the start that I'm not a huge mecha-fan, so don't come hunting me down with pitchforks and torches if I somehow offend some of you hardcore fans.\nRight then, Code Geass, a mecha-series taking place in Japan(Area 11), where else? Let's start this going over everything that I didn't like about the series, so we can save the good stuff for the end. First of all, this isn't a spoiler and you'll see this in the first episode, but mecha-machines with jetpowered inline-skates somehow doesn't really cut it for me... Secondly, some of the characters\n          \n        in the series are really annoying, and I mean truly, honest-to-whatever-deity-you-praise annoying. We got the idealistic goody-two-shoes who wants to save everyone, the weak, confused and uncertain nuisance and some others who are just, or go, blatantly and frustratingly insane in an unamusing way. Also, some of the weapons are quite 'over the top', but I suppose that's common for this type of genre.\nNow, on to the stuff that wasn't bad! First of all, you got to love the main character no matter what, truly the main reason to watch the series is simply to see him act and think. There's also the fact that the story plotwise is engaging and interesting, aswell as dealing with many fun things, such as racism and patriotism (don't get me wrong, I don't support any of those things). The humor in the show is also quite enjoyable at times, especially the shamless, comedic gaggery that has absolutely no plot-significance, like the cat-biting jokes. The artwork is stylish and well done and the sound is of good quality. I can't say too much about the music, there wasn't anything that caught my intention like in some other shows, but then again none of the music bothered me, so it was alright.\nSo what's the summary of all this then? Well, if you like robots that war with eachother, people making up schemes and some humor mixed up somewhat then you'll probably want to watch this show. However, it wouldn't surprise me if you end up hating half of the characters and would be very happy to see them launched out of a cannon into the sun. And if the creators of the show intended to get me sucked in and force me to sit around on my butt waiting for the next season then mission bloody accomplished I suppose. Overall, it's not a bad series and there are moments of true brilliance, but some things could have been left out, or removed entirely, to make it alot better. \n        "},

Most people will disagree with me on this subject, but I think Code Geass is in fact more thought provoking than Death Note. Don't get me wrong, I loved Death Note and I always will. However, Code Geass gave me something that Death note just couldn't...\nI had actually watched Code Geass about 2 years ago, and I was really glad that I did. Recently I decided to re-watch Code Geass, and in doing so I gained a new appreciation for\n          \n        it. I saw this quote floating around the internet, \"If Death Note is chess, then Code Geass is Checkers,\" and to some degree, I agree. As far as outwitting and being outwitted goes, I think we can all agree that Death Note is superior. What Code Geass does do, I feel, better than Death Note, is explaining the mentality of the show. \"Why did the main character do this?\" \"What is his drive for killing all these people?\" \"Is this just? In fact, what is just anyways?\" In Death Note I feel the main protagonists reasoning for killing all the people he did is... far fetched, and poorly explained. Code Geass didn't do that much better a job, but I feel getting revenge on the people who killed your mother, while at the same time creating a safe environment for your crippled sister is a bit more believable. \nAs far as character goes, I wish I could score it at an eleven (no pun intended). Maybe it's just me, but a character that is strong willed and actually able to do something for him/herself is way more attractive then the usual \"worthless sacks of shit\" that seem to dominate anime and manga today. The characters in this story would be totally perfect, but for some reason the creators felt the urge to put the most annoying, worthless, and downright pitiful character I have ever had the displeasure of watching. If you find yourself wanting to break \"Nina\"'s neck, don't worry buddy, I'm here with you.\nOne of the only (and biggest) complaints I had regarding code geass was, yes, the art. I'm not saying the art is horrible or anything- in fact- it's far from it. That is, if this were a shoujo manga or something. The heads are big, the colors are way too bright, and everyone looks way too... nice? As far as story goes, this should be one ho dank, depressing anime. The main character kills his blood brother before the first few episodes are done, for gods sake! I might just be ranting over here by myself, but in my opinion they could have chose a much better art style.\nHowever, don't let that discourage you from watching a great anime. After the first episode, you'll stop noticing and start code geass'n. Oh, also I noticed that a lot of people put this off because they hate the Mecha aspect of it, which I can understand. Honestly I don't get the whole Mecha fad, but it works out well for this anime. If you had any doubts about whether this is worth your time, trust me, it is.\n        "},
			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=24, ["text"]="                          \n    (BACKLOG)\nYou know, I really was about to give up on the mech genre for awhile. I would be lying if I said giant robots beating the crap out of each-other till one of them falls over to a singing orchestra doesn't appeal to me, but what I've seen hasn't impressed me too much. Gurren Laggan had the excuse of not being supposed to be good, but I.S Infinite Stratos and Evangelion had pretty much sucked the tolerance of out of me with the pace of a tortoise running a marathon, so thanks a lot Code Geass for being actual being good! I won't lie, it\n          \n        has flaws big enough to fly an apache helicopter through, but its story and characters are solid to keep me limping around the junkyard of mech anime in hope of finding something half as good until I fall over and suffocate on the discarded OP's... \n     Code Geass has a cast large to populate some European countries, but for now let's talk about Lelouch Lamperouge, a main character smarter than any teenager has any right to be. So when a mysterious woman grants him the power to give a command that his subject must obey, he does the typical thing anyone would do in that situation, and starts to take over the world under the alias \"Zero\", but not before telling an entire army squad to off themselves. He may seem like an cocky, emotionless git at the beginning but once you learn his motivation you really begin to understand him, and as the pressure of leadership piles on him, you see his confident demeanor start to crack. He really was an entertaining character, partly because he could produce some epic inspirational speeches when he wanted to, and partly because his character is complicated enough to drive the story forward, even if he could be a little annoying to watch occasionally. Suzaku Kururugi is Lelouch's childhood friend, but now is a soldier for Brittania. What makes it interesting it that even though he and Lelouch have essentially the same goals, they go about in completely different ways, which not only creates good tension, it also makes you question Lelouch and whether he's doing the right thing. Another purpose for his character I think was to let the viewer into the Brittanian Empire, so that the \"generic evil empire\" stamp avoids them. It lets you see that even some royalty aren't sure if they're doing the right thing, and this gives  good contrast for the show. \n     My biggest problem with the show is that its tone is more shaky than laundry dryer on a treadmill. Imagine someone sneaks into your house in the middle of the night and takes all the labels of your soup jars; you would be confused if you aren't one of those people that didn't fall off their bicycle as a child, and that's how I felt about the show's tone. Code Geass has a completely unnecessary high-school setting(which seems to be a requirement for anime these days) so after a heart-pounding mech fight, the show's a freakin' slice-of-life; love triangles intact. The show also has an extremely dark moment near the end, and while it pleasantly shocked me, it just seemed out of place. \n   Animation is decent enough, and even shines during some of the mech fights, but when nothing interesting is happening, it's painfully average. I understand that choice, but I don't want to be bored while the characters talk about postal stamps either! The sound fits the show, but fits like I fit into my skinny jeans, with rips and pain on both sides. I hardly ever acknowledged the background music, and even the OP's weren't that amazing, so all in all, a \"meh\" sound wise.\n     Code Geass is an intelligent anime, with good action, colorful characters, and nice pace, but it can't seem decide what it wants to be in the end. It flicks through ideas but never settles on one, and never impressed me animation wise. However, I still have the watch the second series, and this is all building to towards soe kin dof grand conclusion. Code Geass is worth your time, no doubt about it, but I'm not going out of my way to get others to see it. But wait I'm writing a positive review on it. So does that means I'm contradicting myself? You know, it's time to stop padding this review out. \n     Final Verdict: 8/10 "},

No! it is absolutely NOT like gundam! So if you think that, i would say 'watch another mech anime damnit!' but i dunt have the time here. This is the top anime of 2007 after all. And nothing\n          \n        says product placement like a pizza hut sign every episode.\nIn the terms of characters:\nYou want someone that's bad ass? CG's got it\nYou want someone that can survive a bullet to the head? CG's got it\nYou want someone with a insane sense of justice? CG's got it\nEach character holds the story up in some way, even the supporting ones. You end up hating some along the way ( i can guarantee you will hate at least 2 of them) and quite a few of the support character plays some huge role either as a stepping stone or a wall in Lelouch's quest for udder world domination. As for the character art...well its nice to see Clamp is still doing the stretched limbs, but at least their faces look cool...so clamp fans should watch it for the character art i guess.\nThe story for this anime just blows me away. Each time there seems to be some solid ground to stand on, something happens that makes that ground appear over your head. It just makes the story do a complete 180 degree turn. The more you watch the more you are impressed by it. Do not expect to be able to predict the ending of this anime, you'll be greatly surprised. Please do not watch if you are younger than 14...there is one scene that is bad for younger viewers.\nThe biggest turnoff for me on this anime would be the freakin 4 month wait between episodes 23 and 24/25 which were aired in a 1 hr special. Of course if you havent watched it yet...i say DAMN YOU!! as you did not feel the pain season running watchers like me felt. When you see the end of episode 23, think of your reaction to it, then think how you would react if ep 24 would not air until a date later this year. We had no idea when the next ep was gonna air except that it was gonna be in the summer.\nAll in all, if you are bored and dont have any anime to watch right now, give Code Geass a shot, the first episode will get you hooked right off the bat.\n        "},

You'd think this anime had a lot to offer, but you'd be sorely wrong.\nCode Geass is NOT a masterpiece, it is NOT a great anime, and isn't much of a good one at all. \nIt does NOT deserve 20th, nor does it deserve 5th for popularity. Why?\nThe plotline was promising, but its execution was terrible.\nThe visuals were the only okay thing in this anime, so it's a pass. \nThe continuity and pace were good, so I won't complain as its pace let me finish quite a lot of episodes.\nThe\n          \n        script. Absolute garbage. This ruined the plotline entirely; what was a promising story turned into episodes full of mindless exchanging of words. The script and implementation of the plotline left so many plotholes and unanswered questions you'd have people scratching their heads in confusion. It's also extremely cringey.\nThe music was quite subtle. I don't pay much attention to the audio, but it doesn't fit in well with the visuals. \nAs for the characters, you can hardly connect to them and they are very much shallow, lacking in depth in almost every aspect. Lelouche is best described as Light without intelligence, intuition or psychological depth. Lelouche is, I daresay, just lucky and driven by ambition (which, might I add, he fails to fulfil).\nNow, the biggest difference between Code Geass and Death Note is its entertainment value. Death Note was, very much, perfect. It was fast paced, the plotline was true to the manga and its execution was well done.\nThe visuals are more realistic than the godforsaken imagery that happens in Code Geass. The script was probably the best thing about the anime, and the music fit the mood accordingly. It left you wanting more after every episode; it left a legacy in its name and gave rise to L, my favourite character of all time.\nI tried to like Code Geass, I really did. Anyone who's seen more than a few animes should know how to spot a good one by now and Code Geass is not one of them. It's extremely overhyped, overrated and honestly quite terrible. I wouldn't be stressing the low quality of this anime if it wasn't for its positive critical acclaim and its rivalry with Death Note. I would have just given it a 2/10, as usual. But as it was so hyped and critically acclaimed, I felt I had to say something.\nIf you compare Code Geass and Death Note, you'll notice something peculiar. You'd think,\"Why am I comparing two pieces of work with obvious differences in quality?\"\nThat's right. Whoever decided to rank Code Geass above Death Note isn't doing their job right. Very sorry for parroting on about Death Note in a Code Geass review, but its comparison was taken so seriously I felt the need to straighten things out.\nOverall, Code Geass is not a good anime.\nTo compare it to Death Note is a direct insult.\n        "},

It combines the brilliance of Death Note with the mecha action in Gundum. Its basically about a boy, Lelouch, who obtains a sacred power to manipulate people, the Geass. He plans to take over the Britannian Empire.\nThe characters are very interesting. For example, CC. The pizza loving green haired heroine of Code Geass. Her past is shrouded in darkness. Her love for pizza adds a lot of humor. CC is easily a fan favorite along w/ Kallen Stadtfeld, the 2nd heroine. Shes tough and is Lelouch's main love interest. Another character of\n          \n        interest is Suzaku. Suzaku is deeply hated by many for getting in Lelouch's way. He's a japanese boy but joined Britannia to change it from the inside. My fav characters are CC and Kallen.\nCode Geass is best watched when all the episodes are released (and they are) due to cliffhangers. Make sure you have nothing to do because from episode 1-25 you'll be hooked.\nAs I said, there is mecha combat. Combat takes place in Knightmare frames. Many people believe the mecha genre is over used. Luckily, Code Geass manages to easily balance out mech fights and the stories that happen before each fight.\nCode Geass nvr lets me down. The balance of story, combat, and character development.\nPeople say Death Note and Code Geass are similar, and they're right. I personally believe Code Geass is dominent.

			{["score"]=3, ["helpful"]=23, ["text"]="                          \n    There are several popular anime whose success is difficult to understand, but perhaps none more so than Code Geass. This anime has been called a masterpiece by various sources, often using such adjectives as \"deep\". This strikes me as a bit odd, because if there's one thing that I think the show lacks, it's intelligence. \nThe premise seems reminiscent of Death Note, setting up an allegedly intelligent male high school student against incredible odds while armed with nothing but his wit and an incredibly potent superpower. In the case of Code Geass, however, the power the protagonist is given is too useful and lacking in\n          \n        any particular weaknesses to allow the kind of entertaining intellectual competition that was present in Death Note. Perhaps to try and compensate for this, the series contains several battles between armies of mecha, but the action in these is actually somewhat dull, and they quickly become repetitive and predictable. \nThese problems are fairly minor compared to some of Code Geass' other issues though. For one, the characters are archetypical and uninteresting, although that problem becomes more apparent in the next season than in this one. Some of them are quite grating as well, a trait for which Suzaku, one of the most important characters in the series, deserves special mention. The plot is a bigger problem than the characters are. It starts off tolerable enough, with the premise looking like it might deliver an enjoyable conflict between Lelouch and his opposition, but it kind of collapses toward the end of the season. About twenty episodes in, an event occurs that makes it look like there will be an end to all hostilities and Lelouch is unwilling to stop it. This could actually have served as a possible ending to the series, but instead it is resolved with one of the most contrived and nonsensical occurrences I've ever witnessed in anime. The next few episodes seem to waste a bit of time almost, and then it ends with a cliffhanger ending that could also have possibly served as an ending to the series but is also resolved by an utterly nonsensical chain of events that makes several supposedly intelligent characters embarrass themselves so that there can be a second season.\nThe art and sound are less worrying. The art style is kind of strange and not visually appealing, but it also isn't terrible. The music is actually somewhat enjoyable and the voice acting is competent. There are a few other things that work somewhat as well. It's kind of enjoyable to watch the fight scenes early on and there are some conflicts that Lelouch gets out of using reasonable tactics rather than something impossible or a deus ex machina. There's a few episodes early on that are fairly solid, and Lelouch is tolerable as a protagonist.\nSo that's Code Geass. A poorly written anime with a messy plot and bad characters. Its creators clearly thought that they were more clever than I think they are, and evidently a lot of people agree with them. The bright side is that this season has a few strengths and is certainly not as terrible as the second season is.\n        "},

Coupled with supernatural aspects and usage of advanced technology, it looks like this anime will take you in for a good ride. \nUnfortunately, from my point of view, it ended up to be a complete drag filled with fanservice, ridiculous plot lines and shallow, underdeveloped characters. And don't forget the completely irrelevant mecha which was added just for the sake of adding it.\n\nStory: A boy receives supernatural powers which have the potential of making him omnipotent. He also has a defined goal: creating a\n          \n        peaceful world for his sister. He is also supposed to be the master strategist...however, instead of using his Geass he goes on and starts the mecha war for no particular reason. With the power given to him he could've just waltzed into the government building and crowned himself as the new leader. End of story. No, the master strategist insisted on cool mecha wars. That is the main problem in the story: the mysterious power completely loses its meaning in the context of events portrayed. The whole thing could've rotated around the rebellion without any kind of magic powers and you wouldn't even notice. It's like they casted it out of the series and only used it in order to create ridiculous plot twists (Euphie's story) which ended up to be laughable. Filled with useless tidbits, plot holes,cliches, ridiculous plot twists the story gets a 4/10.\n\nArt: While smooth, it had a fair share of still shot-camera pans, closeups and sometimes the anatomy of characters would get so ridiculous it puts slenderman to shame. I don't think any of this is justifiable with \"style\". 6/10\n\nSound: Average as it gets. The bg music was unremarkable but it did serve its purpose. 5/10\n\nCharacters: Flat and unlively, poorly written and completely one-dimensional.I don't even feel like going into details there. The cast was pretty big, yet none of them actually stood out. 4/10\n\nEnjoyment: I really tried to enjoy the series, unfortunately, the obvious flaws stood out way too much. I failed to find it entertaining. 4/10\n\nOverall: Average. If you're able to get past the flaws and just enjoy it for the animation, character design and action, then you might enjoy this show. If you're looking for a rich and interesting plot with lively, loveable characters, steer clear. 5/10\n        "},

Then with the pressure of having to serve more dishes, it turns to something it shouldn't have. It decided to offer foods not remotely related to their specialty food. It began to sell burgers, pasta, sushi, and curry. It became such a jumbled mess that the original specialty food was lost. Though it retained its popularity, it was no longer for the original reason. This, is how I see Code Geass.\nCode Geass started with a plot that centered around the character Lelouch and his desire\n          \n        for revenge against his corrupt father. With his mastery in strategy, he leads the rebels against government forces with the use of large machines. This, is a promising start.\nHowever, as the plot progresses, you can see that the story was not carefully crafted beforehand. It seems as though as time passes, new ideas are thrown into the mix and we are taken further and further away from the core of the story. And as the story becomes necessarily complex (Using simple ideas and forcibly mutating them to seem complex), they struggle to explain or conclude each part.\nTo not spoil the show, the end is basically \"things look like they went wrong, but it was my plan all along!\" This is so cliche and the easy way out in trying to make an ending for the out-of-control story that they no longer had any idea what they were doing with. (see spoiler review below)\nCode Geass is good for some amusement, but don't expect a master piece.\n<<SPOILER REVIEW>> (a more in-depth review, but with slight spoilers)\nI'm going to go back to discuss the ending. Throughout the show, we slowly start to see Lelouch's descent into power madness and corruption. These are the same traits we know his father to have. We see him struggle with the idea that he is becoming like his father...and then we're told at the end that it was all a plot and he did it on purpose... It just cheapens the whole inner struggle. I just find this to be silly.\n        "},

A country called Britannia has taken over a large amount of the world, and recently Japan too. Lelouch, after getting involved in an accident, obtains a power called Geass, and uses it to try to overthrow Britannia.\nArt - 8/10\nThis is probably a bit biased on my opinion, but I personally didn't like those super tall, super skinny characters. I mean, they looked\n          \n        sick, but I thought it could have been better. I did however like the designs of the mechas. I haven't watched any gundam or stuff like that, but the designs of each Mecha were pretty good in my opinion.\nSound - 10/10\nThe voice actors of Code Geass were very pleasant to listen too, (Altough I haven't watched the dub myself, the sub was quite well done) and so were the OPs and EDs. (especially JIBUN WO!) The soundtrack itself is better than most if not all the anime I have watched. \nCharacter - 10/10\nMany of the characters in Code Geass, (Especially Lelouch) had unique personalities and uh.. interesting, I guess *Cough**Cough*Nina-*Cough* Many of the characters you think would be generic develop and become enjoyable to watch and some not so enjoyable. But hey, at least they aren't generic, amirite? NinaxTablekun tho...( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\nEnjoyment - 10/10\nCode Geass is one of my favorite anime of all time, and that's why I decided to dedicate my first review on it. My rating here is most likely biased, but the reason why I enjoyed the hell outta Code Geass had to be the unique 'everything' about this show. Now, if I said more I would be spoiling, but Code Geass really portrays modern problems in society very well, and the way Code Geass made these problems in real life seem so entertaining and captivating leaves me bewildered. The ending of Code Geass really got me thinking too, unlike most anime. Is Lelouch alive or dead? Lets find out in R3.\nOverall - 10/10\nTo be exact, I would give it a 9.78 out of 10.0. Code Geass was an unbelievably well done anime in its time, and one of the few anime that will be sitting on my favorites page. Code Geass blends in many genres such as Mecha, Drama, School Life, and Superpowers, and does amazingly well at it. If you're looking for a good show involving Mecha, or Superpowers, Code Geass would be an excellent choice. ALL HAIL LELOUCH!\n        "},

			{["score"]=3, ["helpful"]=13, ["text"]="                          \n    ***SPOILERS***\nBefore I start, I implore you to read the review first before trying to chop my head off. If there is ANYTHING I say in this review that isn't 100% accurate, feel free to let me know. Also, I have not watched the second season nor plan to for a long while because of how appalling season one was.\nNow, since this is a very negative review, there will be spoilers as I said before because it would be impossible to address the major flaws in this series without revealing large parts of the plot, so let's get into this.\nThe largest and most impossible to ignore\n          \n        flaw with this show is filler. I am truly baffled as to how a show can have this much critical success when well over 50% of the show is filler. How the fuck can you even pack THIS much filler into a 25 episode anime? And don't come at me with this \"it's not filler, it's slow paced\" bullshit; it's filler.\nSince I'm going to assume you've already watched this anime before reading this review because of the spoilers warning I gave earlier, I'm going to skip giving a backstory since you all should already know the plot. The story is about our protagonist Lelouch trying to reclaim Japan from the Holy Empire of Brittania as Zero, assisted by the \"Geass\" given to him by C.C., a power that allows Lelouch to bend anyone to his will once he has made eye-contact with him/her. Unfortunately, the plot elements that contribute to this main plotline are less than 50% of the episodes. \nAlready at episode 6 we have a filler episode that contributes absolutely nothing to the main story, \"The Stolen Mask\". It is an episode about Lelouch trying to recover his Zero mask from a cat who stole it, yes, that takes up an entire episode.\nThe entire Mao arc also contributed absolutely nothing to the main plot. It is a completely pointless side-story that takes up about 4 episodes, the most impactful thing to come out of that pointless side-story is Lelouch using his Geass on Shirley to get her to forget ever knowing about Zero. The worst part is that this happens during our protagonists first encounter with Mao, then this meaningless side story of Mao continues on for another three episodes. Can someone explain to me how the kidnapping and recovery of Nunnally contributed ANYTHING to the main story? What was accomplished by the end of the Mao arc? A character (Shirley) with awful characterization that didn't give me a reason to care about her as a character lost her memory of Lelouch. Oh my, soak up four episodes with this shit, fuck freeing Japan from the grips of the Holy Empire.\nThe parts of the show where this bullshit (aka blatant filler) isn't going on, are (for the most part) just side-stories of x group has captured x area, Zero and friends will free the people of x area. I can't call these parts of the show filler though, because they do have some correlation with the main plot, however these are simply just side-stories. \nThe show starts showing some semblance of coherence around episode 18 after Suzaku is knighted by Euphemia. Unfortunately, three episodes later we have another POINTLESS filler episode \"The School Festival Declaration\" where everyone builds a giant pizza. Are you fucking kidding me? Four episodes away from the end of the series and it's fucking \"let's build a pizza\" day.\nI'm getting a headache writing this..on the topic of pizza though, there was something particularly cringe-worthy about the shameless Pizza Hut product placement.\nSigh, regardless, continuing on from let's build a pizza day, the show again shows a bit of coherence for three episodes, then ends on a cliffhanger.\nOverall - This anime was recommended to me because all I had been watching up until this was psychological, dark, dementia type anime like Lain, NHK, Koi Kaze etc, and this was my break from those types of shows, so I had absolutely no bias while coming into the show, all i was expecting was something decent so my review is purely objective.\nThis was truly one of the most fatiguing and frustrating anime experiences I've ever had. The only reason I didn't give this a 1 is because the art and sound were fairly good. This show is compared to Death Note a lot but I don't see the comparison whatsoever. Death Note, while not flawless, has a coherent plot. Geass is a clusterfuck of filler and side-stories with poor characterization. I couldn't find myself able to give a shit about any of the characters, the characterization was that bad. HOW THE FUCK IS THIS SO POPULAR? You know what I shouldn't be surprised because garbage like Ghoul are among the most popular, and that pile of shit was actually better than Geass, even though it's like comparing dog shit to cow shit. \nAnyway, I'm going off on a tangent now because writing this really annoyed me.\n3/10, do yourself a favor and don't watch it."},
			{["score"]=3, ["helpful"]=22, ["text"]="                          \n    Well, here I am, writing my first-ever anime review. I'm certainly no anime expert, as I tend to be very picky about what I watch and won't invest my time into a show unless I feel fairly confident that I'm going to really get something out of it. So, after reading countless rave reviews of Code Geass, I finally decided that I had to see what all the hoopla was about. It's worth noting that Death Note is my favorite anime--hell, possibly my favorite show period--of all time. It's a show that I hold dear. Naturally, I had to check out the show that constantly\n          \n        gets compared to my beloved Death Note, and while I doubted from the start that I would enjoy it on the same level, I had very high hopes that CG would at least take me on a riveting and stimulating ride.\nBoy, was I wrong. Look--I tend to go along with the notion that things don't get extremely popular unless there's a good reason, whether that thing suits my personal tastes or not. But now, after struggling through sixteen episodes of this show, I can honestly say that I have no idea how this show became at all popular in the first place, much less considered a rival to Death Note. That is, in my personal opinion, a complete insult to DN. I could go on for hours about the reasons why that is, but I'll sum it all up with this: the beauty of DN is in its subtlety, and how rooted in reality the concepts and events are despite the supernatural themes of it all. CG, on the other hand, wouldn't know subtlety if it ran up and spat in its face. From the first episode, the series comes off as spastic, frantic, and downright desperate to convince you that you're being entertained. While DN has a clear point and sticks to it; CG has no point. There; I've addressed the whole DN/CG comparison. Moving on.\nThis is the first show that I have ever made it past the second episode of and then didn't complete. How did that happen? By me clinging to the hope that the series would make a turn-around at some point and start impressing me, proving me that my first impressions had been wrong. What I got instead was a slow, steady spiral into absurdity that eventually became so unbearable that I had to abandon a series for the first time. Since spoilers are discouraged, I'll instead have a list at the bottom detailing the worst examples from my list of ridiculous, inexplicable, plot-holey moments that I managed to get through. I'll say this though, since it shouldn't count as a spoiler: the thing that finally broke me was the clapping guy. I almost turned off my Xbox after his first episode, but I was willing to press onward since it looked like his role had been concluded. When he turned up again, I just couldn't handle any more. Ironically, this guy had one of the more interesting backstories, and his was a premise that I think, in different hands, could've become something pretty compelling. It's a bad sign when the most obnoxious character in the whole show is also the only one that manages to pique my interest even 1%. The completionist in me wanted to know how the story ended (or didn't, as the case turned out to be) so I read the summaries of the remaining episodes, half hoping that I would read something mind-blowing that would make me kick myself for not sticking with it. I didn't. It should go without saying that I will not be watching the second season.\nAnyway, I won't get too deep into a discussion of the art, soundtrack, etc. since it's been echoed a million times on this site already. All I'll say is that the female characters looked totally generic, and the two leading males, Lelouch and Suzaku, were shameless Gary Stus. It's no coincidence that the last episode I watched included Suzaku turning into a Spiderman-Flash chimera and outrunning/round-housing a machine gun. Aye-yay-yay. To the art's credit, Lelouch was very, very cute, and being able to stare at him may have subconsciously been what carried me (partially) through the series.\nI'll conclude with my list of ridiculousness, but I want to point something out, too. My extremely harsh review of CG may make me seem like the type that simply doesn't think any anime is good enough, but that's not true. I'm usually not that tough of a critic, and I tend to give cut shows a lot of slack. All of my favorite series have their flaws, even the ones I give 10s. I suppose the difference is that those other series managed to entertain me and get into my heart and/or soul and/or mind despite their shortcomings. CG, on the other hand, tried my patience and fortitude like no other series I've ever seen. To the millions who loved it and got a lot out of it, I'm glad for you, but I really can't understand it. To each their own, I suppose.\n****SPOILER ALERT****\nWhere did Lelouch get that helmet? Did he buy it? Are the high-tech customized villain gear stores in this alternate reality, ones that can link with your brain and reveal only your left eye whenever you will it so? Some may consider this nit-picking, but these sort of things bother me, especially in series that try to be somewhat realisitic.\nThe whole resolution to Lelouch and Shirley's...whatever it was. So I'm supposed to buy that all of their friends, not to mention the entire school, are cool with playing along with Shirley not recognizing him and knowing nothing about him? For like, ever? I would love for someone to look me dead in the eye and tell me with a straight face that that whole plotline wasn't completely idiotic.\nIn the same vein, the fact that no one ever tried to pin Lelouch down about his suspicious behavior, as well as how conveniently MIA he was each and every time something big with the Black Knights happened, really bothered me. Coupled with the fact that Zero has his exact height, build, and practically the same voice, and you've got yourself a supporting cast that's dumb as rocks in order to protect the \"story\" from falling apart after episode 4.\nThere are other little things I could get into, but it would quickly become redundant, and this review has gotten too long already. Perhaps shockingly, however, I will answer \"yes\" to the \"would you recommend this\" question, with one stipulation. I would recommend this to someone who has never seen any other anime before, so that I could then show them some decent series and be able to use CG as a baseline. As in, \"see how great that was? SO much better and more sensible than how they did it in Code Geass.\"\n        "},

			{["score"]=4, ["helpful"]=12, ["text"]="                          \n    Code Geass is a bad show, why?. \nWell, for start the character they are flags, Its unique attribute is to be \"smart\" and even is. Light, for example, at least knew how to bring a situation or make plans instead Lelouch is disgusting character that manages all by chance and end of the day, does not even have a real evolution.\nAnother problem I have with the program is its design. Seriously, it's horrible, you know I hate with all my heart to elderly degenerate CLAMP. But, beyond that is my main problem with the show and its artists that displeases me ... The design is\n          \n        definitely bad, the heads are small, the characters are 3 meters, arms and legs are long, and Pokeballs eyes seem, are disproportionate, and at the end of the day, the mechas ... are pretty good, I remember shows like Neon Genesis Evangelion and although I do not like them, admit they are pretty bad ass.\nBut after all, my main problem with this show is its script. The strategies are full of deus ex machinas that has not been presented. Without going any further, in the second episode, Lelouch gets a fucking army of robots to their friends when they never said they were there. Also as I said, situations happen because the script requires it, in the second episode seems that Lelouch will die, oh no wait, a lady falls from the sky and will save, in the first look set to kill Lelouch ah not expected. If the girl with no personality magically doing it with his magic .... Are you serious ?. So the situation is not resolved, and if you're going to do, has the power of a bitch girl at least.\nHopefully, the technical work and mobility of the characters is very well done and robots unlike humans in the series. They have a very masculine design\n4/10 Very Bad\nIn conclusion, is it Code Geass recommend? ... There really is very poorly written and does not serve to casualfag material.\n        "},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=14, ["text"]="\n                          \n    I'm not a fan of mechas. I despise mechas with all my heart. This is why I avoided Code Geass for a long time even though it became mainstream. This is also why I hate Gundam shows with a passion. I decided to give this show a try and next thing I know, I was hooked. \n\n[Story]: (9.2/10)\nCode Geass takes place in an alternate modern day timeline where the world is split between three superpowers: The Holy Britannian Empire, The Chinese Federation, and the European Union. On August 10, 2010, the Holy Britannian Empire set its sight to Japan and invaded Japan within one month\n          \n        with their use of new mobile humanoid armor vehicles dubbed Knightmare Frames. Japan has been stripped of its right and identity, now re-named by the Britannians \"Area 11\".\nThe story, in my opinion, is magnificent. Well, it could have been a perfect masterpiece if it wasn't for the last few episodes where they decided to cram in more plot twists and left the viewers with more plot holes that will most likely be answered in the second season and of course, the season finale cliffhanger. I didn't see it as a bad thing but I also didn't see it as a good thing either. I'm the kind of guy who watches a show and expects everything to be answered in the season alone. This is why I don't like plot holes and season finale cliffhangers. Anyways, This are literally the only flaws I found within Code Geass. Everything else is perfect.\nBack to the story, I love it. I love how the conflicts unravel between the superpower countries, I just love the strategies that are being planned by the characters and see them play out, and etc. \nThe politics in the show are almost realistic and they've done a great job of displaying the character's tactics. This clearly shows that the staff of Code Geass knew their politics very well and they also knew how leadership situation plays out. The show also has a lot of plot twists and most of them are executed perfectly. Some of them are minor plot twists and most of them are shocking plot twists that will leave you at awe and will affect the overall plot. Man, the plot twists are ready to bite's Lelouch's ass when it's needed to. \nThe pacing is perfect. It doesn't move too fast and it doesn't move too slow either. It explains the situation that's going on around and if it leaves a few plot holes, the show will answer it in the later episodes. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Art/Animation]: (8/10)\nThe Animation for it's time is great. When was this show made? 2006? 2007? Whatever, the animation looks beautiful, the environment looks great for its time and the mecha's design are gorgeous. Especially the Lancelot and the Guren Mark II. You know, for a 2006 anime, the mecha fighting scenes are very fluid. There's no still frames and everything is flowing smoothly. However, the biggest issue I have in terms of CG's animation is the character design. The characters tend to be inhumanly tall, inhumanly slender, and inhumanly pretty, like they took an instant-growth pill because they were a bunch of elves in their previous lives or something. I got used to the character designs after 5 episodes but I still get bothered by it from time to time. For the love of god, I hope that CLAMP doesn't do the character design for the next season. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Sound]: (8/10)\nThe soundtrack, in my opinion, is great. The background theme that plays during the battle scenes are awesome and it fits so well. There is one issue though. The music used in dramatic scenes. I'm probably the only one thinking that here but it doesn't fit. Just play some goddamn theme instead of some guy singing in the background which felt out of place. There are 3 OP theme songs and 2 ED theme songs. \nThe 1st OP is \"COLORS\" by FLOW, the 2nd OP is \"Kaidoku Funou\" by Jinn and the 3rd OP is \"Hitomi no Tsubasa\" by Access. My opinions on the OP theme songs? The 1st OP is one of the best opening soundtrack I've ever heard. The 2nd OP is the worst opening soundtrack I've ever heard. I just skipped the 2nd opening before they switched to the 3rd opening which is a lot better than the 2nd opening. Why couldn't the 3rd opening be the 2nd opening? The singer in the 2nd opening is annoying as hell. Even Justin Bieber is better than Jinn. Now my opinions on the ED theme songs. The 1st ED theme song is great and the 2nd ED theme song is, once again, sung by an annoying singer who can't even sing. \nI watched the show in English Dub so I'm going to review the English VA. In my opinion, the English Voices fits the show very well. I mean, why would a Britannian speak perfect Japanese? Why is one of the Chinese Federation members speaking perfect Japanese? Anyways, most of them did a great job except Suzaku's VA. He sounds somewhat monotonic in some scenes. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Characters]: (10/10)\nEasily a perfect score from me. Why? Because most of the characters are well written, fully developed, and most of them are Three.Fucking.Dimensional. Take notes, future potential writers. CG shows that it's not hard to give your character some life, give him/her some goddamn personality (looking at you Touma), make him/her not a useless character, and etc. Now, the actual character's review.\nLelouch Lamperouge or you can call him Lelouch vi Britannia which I highly prefer calling, is the main protagonist of the show and a student of the Ashford Academy High School. One day, he got a mysterious ability called \"Geass\" from a girl named C2 which allows him to command other people whatever he wants. However, there are restrictions and side effects. Lelouch just became one my new favorite characters and currently one of the best protagonist I have ever seen. Why? Because he's strategically smart, his plans are not dumb and is well thought out, he has flaws just like the rest of the human beings, he doesn't whine when his plans don't go to plan, he's a well developed and a three dimensional main protagonist, and I can literally list more but this is getting way too long. \nC.C or what the Eng. Dub calls her, C2 which I also highly prefer calling her, is a mysterious girl who gave Lelouch the \"Geass\" and allied up with him to protect his life. C2 is now also one of my new favorite characters because she's a developed character, she has a personality, she's not annoying and she likes eating huge amounts of pizza. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Enjoyment]: (10/10)\nEven though I hate mechas, I easily enjoyed Code Geass as a whole because of the engaging and well thought out story, likable characters, and it balances dialogues and action which prevented me from getting bored.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[OVERALL]: (9.5/10)\nCode Geass is one of the best shows I've seen yet. Besides the plot holes and the season finale cliffhanger, I seriously love the story, the politics behind the show, Lelouch, and the action scenes doesn't drag out too long instead of some random explosions with no meaning behind it.

			{["score"]=5, ["helpful"]=20, ["text"]="                          \n    It's been a while since I watched this, but I felt like I should weigh in against the mountain of praise.  \nCode Geass is an exercise in wasted potential.  The basic idea of the show could have been interesting with the right handling, but not like this.  \nI never sat through more than a couple of episodes at a time.  I was constantly annoyed by the fact that the show expects viewers to accept whatever Lelouch does as brilliant, instead of thinking for themselves.  In particular, there is one part that had me thinking \"Why is he doing this? \n          \n        He has access to military hardware and personel.  He has a thousand easy ways to solve this problem without being anywhere near it.  This is positively moronic.\"  If he was a chess player, he'd be the kind that plays only with his queen, and that can only go so far.  If he was really that brilliant he'd make masterful use of all his pieces instead.  \nWhat's more, the overall feel of the show is really not that different from every other show made for teenage audience.  Maybe I've tried a few thousand more titles than the people who like this thing, but seriously, it's the usual circus.  \"Look how (insert hyperbole here) this is!\" all day long.  It takes more than that to hold my interest.  "},

Make no mistake, there are still all the typical mecha elements present, but Code Geass is by no means to be lumped with them - the thrill is in watching the bold planning and execution of Lelouch, the Emperor of Brittania, and others as they play out a high-stakes game of strategy and tactics with war machines.\n          \n        Furthermore, those who enjoy trying to figure out the plans and tactics used before they are revealed will have an absolute field-day with this one - trying to predict just how each battle (and the war as a whole) will play out is no easy task - the thrill of the ever-changing plot is real. \n        "},
			{["score"]=7, ["helpful"]=20, ["text"]="                          \n    Take the Death Note concept and execute it a bit less well, take the high school comedy genre and execute it as well as the genre really allows (that is to say, clichéd beyond saving), make the critical addition of hot mecha action, and you have Code Geass. Except that doesn’t do it justice, because what makes Code Geass enjoyable and unique is exactly this awkward smorgasbord. Geass is a shounen that mostly doesn’t take itself seriously, accomplishing a satisfying balance between the darker political mindgames and the light-hearted school life. That is all the producers set out to accomplish in season 1 (of 2)\n          \n        and to this regard they have succeeded heroically.\nWhile Code Geass is only the starting block for the larger scale events of Code Geass R2, it certainly does not hold back, delivering from the get go the twists and turns that a political drama demands. It appears at first to be nothing more than a classic mecha/highschool anime with a few ideas of its own thrown in, but I found myself engrossed when, at times, it twisted the light-hearted and over the top theme of the show completely on its head. When it needs to, Geass delivers a genuinely intriguing and shocking battle of wits between our anti-hero Zero, the secret identity of Lelouch, and the might of the British Empire. Yes you read that right by the way, the British Empire has taken over Japan in Code Geass, which is impossible and awesome in equal measures.\nThere is a very important feature to Code Geass that stands out: That of Lelouch’s power, Geass, which guarantees him absolute obedience of anyone he should wish to use it on. The exact nature of this power though is kept purposefully vague in the first season, playing a more significant part in R2. This has its benefit and disadvantages in my mind, but suffice to say that the context surrounding this Geass power is certainly not forgotten in season 1, and is addressed sufficiently well enough for the audience to appreciate its strengths and weaknesses. \nThe first and last few minutes of each episode are where Geass stumbles the most. Colors is one of the best ops ever, plain fact. It is truly unfortunate then that one of anime’s best ops stands next to the gold award winner for one the worst op I have subjected my ears to. Further to this, the second op makes the unfortunate compromise of reusing a significant portion of clips from the first op video. I recommend just playing the first op over the video of the second op – you won’t be able to tell the difference, and your ears will thank you for it. \nThere is a general both-good-and-bad theme going on in this review, and this extends right down to the animation quality. Character models are blown vastly out of proportion, and although I got used to it, it still stuck out as a sore thumb. Otherwise though, the animation is pleasant and colourful for a 2006 anime, a stark contrast to the black and white palette of Death Note (which curiously aired the same year as Geass. That would have been a fun year to watch anime). Mecha fights are enjoyable if uninspired, but then I would never expect a mecha fight to be anything more than clichéd. The ultra-powerful Lancelot mech is the saving light to Geass’ fights, with the help of Suzaku in the Lancelot’s cockpit, who is both Lelouch’s best friend and most hated enemy, this one man army card is played as well as it could be. The contrast between Suzaku’s innate mecha ability and Lelouch’s careful planning is the heart and soul of any scene with a mech in it. \nI think I sound as though I’m damning the show, but that is certainly not the message I want to be getting across. Code Geass is a fun and inventive take on the psychological mecha genre best exemplified by shows like Evangelion, although in contrast to Eva, Code Geass took the initiative to place a much larger focus on the high-school side of things, too large a focus for me. Lelouch though is a genuinely fantastic protagonist throughout, on par or superior to the likes of Yagami Light, and Code Geass does not hide the fact that its protagonist is not really the hero we expect him to be. By the end of season 1, what started as the story of a simple high school student given a strange power has become a battle for the future of a nation, with the same school boy at the centre of it all. It saddens me a bit to admit it, but it would be impossible to picture Code Geass without the light-hearted moments to counter the moments of exciting high-stakes drama.\nRecommendations: Death Note. Both shows thrive of the confrontation between friends who are unknowingly each other’s enemies. Geass has Lelouch and Suzaku, and Death Note was at its best during the direct confrontations between Kira/Light and L."},

I felt perverted. After seeing this, I decided to go back to my normal habits, in watching anime that isn't... well... porn.\nStory: 10/10\nLelouch Lamperouge or... if I said anymore it'd be a spoiler. Lelouch Lamperouge  is a high school kid, that gets into the wrong situation and ends up being tangled up with terrorists. Police and shit get the wrong idea\n          \n        and think that Lelouch is the terrorist, and are about to kill him. Just before dying, Lelouch makes a contract with a mysterious girl named \"C.C\" which gives him the power to make anyone obey absolutely any order. The power is called... you guessed it. Geass. You didn't guess it? Well... not my problem, then... So, Lelouch decides to make the world a better place for his younger sister Nunnally, and kill all the mother-fucking Brittanians. Doing so with his so-called Geass power.\nArt: 8/10\nThe art style, animation style, whatever you want to call it, is awesome, but for some reason I don't give it a 10. Eh, I don't understand my own logic, but there's just something missing, maybe because it was made in 2006? I don't know, I might just be being racist, but, eh, just a couple of things missing I just can't quite lay my finger on it.\nSound: 10/10\nThe soundtrack is amazing and I would advise anyone to listen to it... or not, just listen to it while watching the anime, because, you know, the music plays in the background in the scenes. I was going to be high, and give the sound a 9/10, but I thought \"Wait a minute! I didn't smoke pot today! I'm not going to be high!\" so I gave it a 10.\nCharacter: 9/10\nSome characters I don't like, so I gave it a 9/10, but the characters that I don't like I seem to like at times, because they're being normal. I don't know. C.C, Lelouch and Kallen are top tier, I don't know about Suzaku, he kinda gets on my nerves.\nOverall: 10/10\nThis anime made me stop being a pervert and start watching normal anime again. I am now watching the second season, and after that I'm going to go look for some more normal anime.\nThings to not take seriously: The quote about smoking pot. I don't smoke pot, or smoke at all. And, you do take the hentai part seriously, that shit seriously happened.\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=14, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I had put off Code Geass for such a long time despite hearing many good things about it. To me, that whole mecha thing always feels like a ripoff of Gundam. In addition, i had heard from a few friends that \"it's like death note\" or \"it's death note with robots\" & while this comparison is an easy conclusion, when you get down to it, they're pretty different but that's obvious considering their different stores. \nAnyway, the STORY; \nGreat story. One of the best i have ever come across. It's not especially unique but entirely entertaining and well thought out, never rushed & always keeping\n          \n        you on the edge. It's fairly unpredictable or at least, not a cliche story. The story progresses well with each episode, and has a perfect blend of comedy, action, psychology, idealism & so on & so on. Only problem I had was that after each episode,(or many) instead of leaving off directly with what had just happened at the end of the previous episode, it takes you to some unknown point in the future and so sometimes, it can be confusing as i was. There were a few times i asked myself what the fuck was going on but it was brief so maybe it is worth mentioning. There are lots of tiny sub plots and interesting developments that all relate to the overall story scheme and so in short, there is no objective fault with the story. \nArt: \nI hate clamps art style. So if you don't like it then you can't really do anything about it. I never liked it but the anime is so good it doesn't matter at all. Their skinny lanky bodies put me off but it's not animated badly, it's just a style so i rated it a 7/10 just because i dislike the style, but overall, great animation, especially with the mecha robot suit things(they have names but there's too many to count to list) & they give special attention to the main character and so his artwork from facial features, movements, etc is especially great. \nsound: \nAgain, if you don't like the opening/ending or music than what can you do? \nI liked the first opening by FLOW, as I like the band FLOW & it seemed appropriate. The other two, i didn't like at all, nor did i like any of the ending & the sound for this show isn't particularly great anyway. It's definitely not memorable except for maybe the first opening and none of the background music was especially memorable or outstanding, probably average to ok at best.  But none of it hinders the anime nor does it ever feel out of place. If you pay attention to the sound the entire time, you'll probably come to the conclusion that \"It's okay\" & that \"They could have done better\". \nCharacters: \nThere a shitload of characters, and though so many are one dimensional & unchanging, they are there for a decent amount of episodes, and serve some function. The main character, Lelouch, is so fantastically presented and dealt with that despite his choices, which let's be honest, in the very general term of the word, \"Bad\". But existentially, no right or wrong blah blah blah . The mindset he has, the choices he makes, his ideals, his life, his family, his opinions, they are all very real and unlike death note's Light(as the two animes are compared) he is much more likable. The other characters such as Suzuku and Euphemia and C.C all have great development as well, though suzuku's ideals are cliche as fuck which made me dislike him most of the time but eventually, through developments in the story, he becomes much more understandable at the least. Euphemia is cliche in many regards but really, that whole cliche thing isn't too bad because regardless, there are people who think like that(you'll know exactly what when you watch the anime) & code geass gives every character a fresh look & so their ideals are the only things truly cliche, not so much the characters themselves. Each have a decent unique story & past. C.C is very unique but mostly because her story & past are only ever briefly touched upon & never really explained which i imagine will be in the next season. Some characters appear out of nowhere which is confusing & are seemingly very important but again, i probably have to wait until next season. Overall, great characters, and even the minor ones are fresh, as is their story. \nEnjoyment & conclusion:\nAs with anything it comes down to your own satisfaction. I loved this anime and have found no objective faults, and only subjective faults i have are with the artwork. It is a great anime with a fresh new plot, great unique characters and an amazing story that always makes you want to watch the next episode. There is no real right & wrong and the show presents it as such with characters on all sides with pasts, opinions, family, loved ones, etc. \nI high recommend this anime & to any of the people who click, \"i did not find this helpful\" I can't possibly understand why so fuck you in advance.  \n        "},
			{["score"]=1, ["helpful"]=19, ["text"]="                          \n    This show is just all around bad for me. I want to like it, but there's nothing to like.\nThe story was amusing; I loved the idea of large scale kingdoms fighting each other using rl setting(s), but they lost me when they introduced mecha. That was a huge blunder to what I was hoping for with this show.\nLelouch is an interesting character, but I quickly lost interest in him and this show over time. He sort of fell into the generic anti hero trope for me.\nThe art and sound are great but it's not enough reason to watch a show. It's like eating an apple\n          \n        just because it looks good and even though it tastes like ass, you still eat it anyway. \nI had high hopes for this show, but they blew it. They had the perfect plot concept, an (almost) perfect MC, but they managed to ruin it within a few episodes.\nThe only reason why I bothered watching more than half of this show's episodes is because JYB voices Lelouch, and I have a inexplicable bias towards him. But, as I said, art and sound isn't enough reason to watch a show.\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=19, ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Story: I really enjoyed how this storyline rolls out, it's just like deathnote, the first episode pulls you right into what's going on and the second one fuels your interest. The rest of the episodes expand on the simple plot and twist and turns it, but all along the way you have a good idea of what's going on. \nThough as much as the storyline can resemble Deathnote, I managed to dig out a bunch more themes. This is very much like a mix of Deathnote's 'I want to change the world to my liking' plus Full Metal Alchemist's 'What is a human capable of\n          \n        doing?' It's extremely psychological and introduces people to a different way of thinking.\nArt: Overall the art is fine, though I'm not really picky with art. Sometimes Leloouch's blocky hair made me a bit unsure, but those are just sometimes.\nSound: I don't recal much music in the episodes, just the little mood adders, those were really good. \nCharacter: Yes, there is a bunch of character developement. Lelouch slowly becomes more evil (like Light from Deathnote) yet he still manages to cling to his human emotions to his sister and friends. And C.C. also has some changes, though the seris she becomes more open to Lelouch (though it does seem like he's manipulating her). My favourite character developement is on Suzaku, when he changes from a loving, nice boy to a killer because of what Zero does to him (not spoiling hopefully). The rest of the characters also undergo some little changes, but I'm not going to get into them.\nOverall: I just finished this anime yesterday and now I can't wait until the Second season comes out next year (Spring 2008). For anyone who loves a good mix of different genres, Code Geass has everything. Also for those who finished Deathnote and is undergoing obessions and such, WATCH CODE GEASS!\n        "},

The story is    an overwhelming drama that poses unanswerable moral and philosophical questions. But those do not make it downright heavy because it's all balanced out by touches of student life here and there, little stories of friendship and trust not to mention romance. Everything is all good and amazing especially that one big twisted ending.\nThe bad stuff: Very twisted ending. Every episode takes your breath away that you cannot wait for the next episode. \n"},
			{["score"]=4, ["helpful"]=6, ["text"]="NOTE: This review applies to the first 2 seasons of Code Geass.  I do not plan to watch and review Season 3.\nThe Positive Side: Code Geass takes place in an alternate future, wherein Britannia (Great Britain with mechs and Nazis, basically) has conquered Japan.  Lelouch, an exiled Britannian Prince, seeks to topple the Britannian tyranny to avenge his mother and create a kinder world for his blind younger sister, Nunelly.  He is aided by a mysterious power called Geass, which allows him to give irresistible orders and bend other people to his will.\nCode Geass has an intriguing premise and some very strong\n          \n        portrayals of war, racism, colonialism and cultural disenfranchisement.  One of my favorite details of the setting is that under Britannian rule, Japan and the Japanese people have been stripped of their name, and live under the designation, “Area 11.”  It’s a brilliant detail that shows the lengths to which Britannia goes to destroy Japan’s sense of identity.\nThrough the first season, Code Geass exhibits strong characterization on all sides of its conflict.   Lelouch’s friend and archrival, Suzaku, opposes him throughout the first season, and while we are inclined to root for Lelouch, given the horrific atrocities of the Britanian’s, it easy to understand why Suzaku is on the other side, and hard to blame him or dislike him.  Another excellent addition to the supporting cast is Kallen Kozuki, a daring young freedom fighter and half-Japanese Britannian student who joins up with Lelouch’s rebellion on behalf of her abused and down-trodden Japanese mother.  The brilliance of Kallen is that she is able to maintain a kind of purity of character when Lelouch begins to slip morally ambiguous behavior.  While Lelouch embodies the duality of war—noble intentions with seemingly unavoidable, evil methods—Kallen embodies the courageous patriot, and as long she remains in the focus of the narrative, she ensures we have someone to root for.\nWar is an immense and difficult topic to handle in anime, and it’s rare to find a Shonen series that doesn’t reduce it to a conflict between obvious heroes and uniformly sadistic and irredeemable villains.  Code Geass refuses this simplification, and for that at least, it deserves a little respect.\nThe Negative Side: Like its protagonist, Code Geass starts off full of promise and blazing ambition, but loses its path, and ultimately, seems to forget what it was trying to achieve in the first place.  Code Geass should have been one of the greatest anime ever made, but its faults are so numerous and distracting that it’s often irritating to watch, and ultimately, very hard to take seriously.\nLet’s begin with the artwork.  While the mecha are well-drawn and have intriguing designs, and most of the action is very fluid, the artists flounder any time they’re required to draw a person.  Nearly every member of the cast is suffering from Terminal Anorexia, Chihuahua Head Syndrome and Early Onset Yaoi Hands.  Even the girls have yaoi hands.  There’s a few martial artists and soldiers in the cast, but the quality of the mecha fights makes every fight not involving a mecha look even more ridiculous.  Everyone moves like they’re filled with helium instead of blood.  Supposedly human characters leap five times their height, defy gravity and inertia and spontaneously spin with nothing to draw traction from but thin air.  If this was explicitly a supernatural martial arts anime like Ranma ½ or Fist of the North Star, I’d have no problem with this kind of silliness, but Geass’s efforts to feel grounded and real are shattered in nearly every hand-to-hand fight.\nEven more irritating is Geass’s insistence on cramming fan-service into scenes where it has no business being.  There’s a moment late n the first season where Kallen and Suzaku become mysteriously stranded on a tropical Island.  Kallen, in a complete defiance of the concept of logical priorities, decides this is the perfect time to take a shower.  Suzaku stumbles on Kallen while she’s naked and bathing in a waterfall.  Kallen immediately recognizes Suzaku as an enemy, draws her knife and charges him.\nThis should have been one of the tensest and most dramatic scenes in the series.  Kallen and Suzaku have both been built as sympathetic and complex characters, and without a moment’s warning, both are thrust into mortal danger.  In that moment, I was afraid that one of them was surely going to die, and I was unsure of who I was rooting for.  Sadly, the animator’s insistence of baring Kallen’s breasts, coupled with Suzaku’s subsequent take-down (which puts Kallen in a position far too reminiscent of being raped) ruins the tone of the scene.  Instead of witnessing two noble characters in a struggle for their beliefs and their survival, we witness a display of the creator’s own bad taste.  The fanservice is almost invariably of the creepy variety, either nonconsensual ‘accidents’ or used as a point of shaming the girls.  Roughly half the battle-scenes are ruined by pointless close-ups of the girls’ breasts and rear-ends.  There are moments when Code Geass feels like it was created as a guide on how not to use fan-service.\nDespite the writers’ knack for characterization, Code Geass degrades its strongest women to a disgusting degree.  Kallen, a fearless revolutionary who has been fighting against Britannia even longer than Lelouch, is forced to wear playboy bunny suit, to her own shame and humiliation.  She is later captured and strapped to a table with what is quite obviously bondage gear, forced to wear a dress that exposes a solid fifty percent of her breasts, and is nearly raped by one of her captors.  C.C. spends most of the series as a stoic, mysterious ally with her own agenda and desires, and is one of the only characters in the series who calls out Lelouch on his stupidity and immoral hypocrisy.  Following a convenient memory lapse in Season 2, C.C. is reduced to a cringing slave-girl, perpetually terrified of being beaten and eagerly subordinating herself to Lelouch, even when asked to remove her clothes.\nCode Geass often uses chess motifs to support its themes of clever planning and manipulation.  This would probably be a lot more effective if anyone who worked on the show had ever learned the rules of chess.  Every time a characters busts out a chess board, you can count on hilariously stupid and illegal moves.  At one point, a character moves his king into check.  Amusingly, his opponent is horrified.\nSpeaking of clever planning… despite the fact that Code Geass puts focus on tactical intelligence, many of Lelouch’s decisions are mind-blowingly stupid.  He walks into obvious traps even he knows they are traps, and is unnecessarily hostile and paranoid towards people who ought to be his allies.  Britannia is not exempt from this, as we see in Season 2, when they dismiss the idea of multiple countries working together in a military campaign laughable, and claim that the result would be ‘an unruly mob’.\n…Hey, Britannians?  Remember that whole “World War 2” thing?  You know, the one that both Britain and Japan fought in?  Turns out countries can actually work together pretty well when they have a common enemy.\nDespite the strength of the characters, the dialogue is frequently hammy and ridiculous.  Sometimes this is justified by Lelouch’s fondness for theatrics, but sometimes, it’s just plain stupid.  There is no context in which the words, “Attention, people of Japan.  Could you all just die, please?” will not be ridiculous.  \nI really wish I could separate seasons 1 and 2, because season 1 is vastly better, but unfortunately, season 1 ends on a total cliff-hanger that demands I take both seasons as halves of the same story.\nCode Geass’s death blow comes near the end of Season 2.  I will refrain from giving spoilers here, but  will say that the strong characterization given to the main characters is wasted, as they seem to forget their own defining motivations.  When characters stop behaving in a way that makes sense for who and what they are, it’s simply not possible to believe in them the way we believe in all the characters we love most dearly.  Where there were once compelling and complex characters, there are now puppets, spouting nonsensical monologues about vague ideals and coldly marching through whatever actions the writers thrust upon them.  No matter how many convoluted schemes or dramatic twists Code Geass hurls at you, the entire effort ends up feeling hollow and pointless. \nFinal Verdict:  Code Geass is riddled with obnoxious faults in taste and style, but beneath these faults, there’s artistic ambition, moral insight and a cast of memorable and exciting characters.   It’s truly a pity this show was less than it could have been.  If you’re curious as to why this anime is so highly rated, feel free to check it out.  Otherwise… I, INKSPIDER VI BRITANNIA, COMMAND YOU… to go watch something better."},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=18, ["text"]="\n                          \n    I'm stepping out of my dark corner in order to write a review for the only anime I feel I can. This is also my first review so I'll try my best not to be too sloppy.\nStory - 9/10\nNow before I have people who praise this anime hate on me for not giving it a 10/10 for the story listen to this, this anime has a second season. This second season is the only reason I give the story a 9 as I feel that for those who don't know about the second season would be quite disappointed. (I know I was it took me\n          \n        a week to find R2). The basics of the plot is the year is 2010 and the Holy Britannia have control over 2/3 of the world and has just taken over Japan, dubbing it Area 11 and the Japanese, 'Eleveners'. Enter Lelouch the once 11th Prince of Britannia who was cast to Japan with his sister Nunnally by their father King of Britannia 'Charles Vi Britannia'. \nArt - 8/10\nThe only reason  gave the art style an 8 is because it really matters on the person watching its preference. Personally I am more-so inclined to watch an anime with a moe-esque characters and scenery, i.e Non Non Biyori. But for an anime that started almost 10 years ago and ran for slightly under a year it has high quality designs and has little things that make it what it is. Such as Lelouchs' eye when he uses Geass and Zeros' mask having an eye slot.\nSound 10/10\nThis is where I can really get into Code Geass, the voices, the music, the OP's and ED's are all so magnificent that I can listen to them now and still enjoy them the same as the first time I heard them, (Notably Stories and Madder Sky, from R2). I chose to watch the dub when I first watched Code Geass and I have since rewatched the dub and watched the sub once and am genuinely pleased to say they are both extraordinary, Johnny Yong Bosch did an incredible job portraying Lelouch and I recommend both sub and dub to people thinking about watching the show, as they both hold up to standard. Back to the soundtrack, without the soundtrack Code Geass wouldn't be half the show it is, it has 45 tracks (from what I gather) and each one of them are used so well that it adds a form of involvement into the show that some anime do not have. It has to have one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard even if you don't want to watch the show I recommend looking into it's soundtrack.\nCharacters - 9/10\nThe only problem I have with the characters is some of them feel a bit forced not so much in a bad way but there's still that presence. Not to mention Nina Einstein the craziest motherf**cker I have ever seen in anime, and I've seen Mirai Nikki. I can't say to much about the characters with out feeling like I'm spoiling stuff, but the characters you need to focus on, i.e Lelouch are done almost to perfection and push the show that little bit further forwards.\nPersonal Enjoyment - 10/10 \nNow even tho I have bickered on bits and pieces Code Geass and it's sequel have to be one of my all time favourite anime and I am quite pleased I didn't spoil any of it, it has been likened to Death Note quite alot and seeming that I have accidentally one way or another spoiled the hell out of that, I would have to agree. Given I feel like Code Geass just has that special something that makes it unique. I would buy this anime without hesitation, and have recommended it to my friends more times than I can account for, the way the music resonates and the characters and story develops are beyond my words and it does something that many anime try for and alot fall short on. It makes you think, about morals, about humanity, about social problems that plague us today such as racism. \nOverall -\nWith all that said and done I give Code Geass R1 a overall of 8.94 out of 10 as without it's second season it would not be near the anime it is today. The fact that even today 9 years after it's making you can go to videos to do with it one YouTube and just see 'ALL HAIL LELOUCH' shows how much of a cultural milestone it is and how much of an affect it has had on the community, I recommend this anime only if your willing to think about what is going on in front of your eyes and are willing to put full attention into it whist you watch each episode.\n\nI hope that I did well enough to garner some people into watching this show and I also hope that this review was up to scratch.\n        "},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=18, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Code Geass is a series that many people love. While it is an older anime compared to today's standards, there are many things to like about it.  It is a mix of many genres: mecha, psychological thriller, a little bit of romance, and action just to name a few. It is an anime with an engaging story, and characters that hopefully will stand the test of time. \nStory (10/10): The story of Code Geass will capture your attention right from the get-go.The action of mech combat, the warfare strategies of the protagonist, and the complex narrative will sure to satisfy many anime fans. \nArt\n          \n        (8/10): While this anime was made almost 10 years ago, it still holds up art-wise. The mech combat still looks great, and the animation is very fluid. However, there may be a few who can be turned-off by the art style of the characters. Their elongated bodies and arms take a little to get used to. But, some find the character designs positively unique. \nSound (10/10): The music in Code Geass can be seen as one of the best points of the anime. There is a great blend of genres of music, and it keeps the tension high when need be and also lowers tension at the opportune moments. The first opening, Colors by FLOW, is especially memorable. The voice actors also do a terrific job portraying the characters. \nCharacters (10/10): There are many characters in the series. The main protagonist, Lelouch vi Britannia, is compared to Light from Death Note by some people. While they both have similarities, they are also very different. Lelouch is a little more positive in terms of personality. He is a strategical genius and watching his plans take action are fun to watch. The secondary protagonist, Suzaku, is also a very interesting character. He can be seen as the opposite of Lelouch. Watching his plan to change the world in a more diplomatic way is commendable. Other notable characters include Kallen (a leader of  Lelouch's rebellion), Nunally (Lelouch's sister), Eupemia (a princess of Britannia), and Lloyd (the creator of Suzaku's mech, the Lancealot). As you can see, there are many unique characters in this series. It can be easy to find one to relate with.\nEnjoyment (10/10): This anime is probably my favorite anime of all time. With its engaging storyline, memorable characters, and great music, it left me begging for more. I am sure that many anime fans will love this series. However, some might find the character designs a little odd at first. Others will find the character designs unique. If you haven't given it a try yet (why haven't you?), check out Code Geass!\n        "},
			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=7, ["text"]="                          \n    I usually break my reviews in points, but I think Code Geass will require something very different.\nI wasn't amazed by art or sound. Sound had nothing special IMO, neither opening nor ending marked me, voice acting was good but not stellar and music was generally forgettable. Art looked pretty good but some faults like those really wierd looking triangle eyes really didn't make it all look so good.\nNot that it matters much because almost everything about Code Geass is in its story.\nAnd it's good. Really good. Really really good. Then it kinda falls. Then it's good again. Then it falls. Then good, then falls. Then\n          \n        good. Then the end.\nBefore I explain my exact issues with Code Geass, I need to say that true masterpieces are always head and shoulders above mediocrity. Always. If you take what I consider to be THE masterpieces of this decade and the last decade, namely the One Punch Man manga(forget the anime) and Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex(both seasons), even at their worst, when GitS goes into filler episodes for its underdevelopped side characters or when OPM delves into a little too much side characters' side stories, they are still very much above mediocrity and never brought boredom or disinterest.\nCode Geass, by this standard, isn't a masterpiece.\nNow it is still an overall very good anime and it's absolutely worth watching. It goes into agressive politics and war policies very well. It starts off great with two \"opposite twins\" characters, Suzaku and Lelouch, one being the paragon of morality, the other being the paragon of success. And for a long time, you think that Code Geass will be an ideological battle between those two, mixed with intrigue, love and war, mystery, lots of attaching characters, and a ton of evil laughs at all of Lelouch's schemes and surprises.\nIt is that for a long time, but then things happen that turn it all in a wholly different direction. It's hard for me to keep this review spoiler-free, so from now on I'll mark at every paragraph if it has spoilers.\nThe first thing is that the opposition between Suzaku and Lelouch eventually fades. Suzaku stops being a moral paragon over time and becomes a hateful killer by the end of the series, thus renouncing his archetype. It's a good thing for his character, it makes him grow from a naive boy into a violent boy, but even then this character isn't so interesting. Suzaku as the naive hero who wants to do good by trying to make peace with the enemy who despises him isn't a lot of fun. I doubt a lot of people like him. And he generally isn't worth writing home about. He's here as an opponent to Lelouch, and without Lelouch, forget him.\nBut since he stops being the naive boy, he just stops being all that important. He just becomes a plot tool, a dangerous foe Lelouch has to look out for.\n(spoilers)\nAs for Lelouch, his growth is far more interesting, and if Suzaku abandons his archetype, Lelouch does so too, but in a very different way. Suzaku goes from naive hero to warring brute. Lelouch however shifts after some events from anti-hero, so a hero with villainous methods, to an outright villain. Now just to be clear, I'm fine with villains. A villain can be tremendously enjoyable to watch and I'm fine with a battle of villains as the main theme. The problem is, it sort of throws away everything we'd been taught with Lelouch. He was half scheming backstabber, half hero, someone hated by all who'd do anything for his goals, but who would also try and reach for something greater and better than his opponents. A conqueror more than a villain. But by the end of the series and the last big twist in season 1, Lelouch is literally nothing more than a villain. Which kind of begs the question, did they really want to build him as an anti-hero? What was the point if he was just going to turn into a villain from actions he isn't responsible for?\nWith that, I am compelled to point the biggest problem with Code Geass past its fairly shoddy art and sound: the lack of vision.\nCode Geass several times shows that it doesn't have the vision, or more precisely the writing, to go the full length of its ideas. At several times, the story goes into the very tragic, into berserk-tier stuff even. If Berserk did one thing beautifully when it comes to its main villain, it's show his true intent with extreme precision. Griffith in Berserk is kind, gentle, intelligent, selfless, beautiful, daring, exciting, charismatic, a master in all things and in every way a Lord and a Hero. But his goal requires extreme, monstrous sacrifices, and he'll go about giving those sacrifices no matter what. Code Geass goes that route at some point as well, except while Berserk clearly put Griffith in villain's seat and made him an unapologetic, hated monster, Code Geass just doesn't have that vision.\n(spoilers)\nThe complete spoilers here is the arc of Shirley. When Shirley's father dies at the battle of Narita, Shirley goes under shock and emotional breakdown, goes to Lelouch for emotional comfort, and steals a kiss from him while crying her eyes out. It's a perfect circle: Lelouch as Zero ordered the avalanche on Narita which crushed Shirley's father. The father was also a kind and fair man who always treated his family with love and care and never harmed anyone, he was simply a soldier and was at his post. And Lelouch is the subject of Shirley's affection since a long time and now she needs him. \nThis perfect circle brings about a ton of subjects at the same time. It makes Lelouch question his actions and brings him in doubt. It makes him feel extremely guilty twofold because Shirley should hate him and because he has feelings for her too(something which is never properly shown in the anime but that we're told about eventually). Shirley starts looking for Zero's real identity to get her revenge, while he has to keep on pressing with the corpse-piling even harder. If he doesn't succeed in his conquest, all the dead will have been for nothing.\nAnd how does that perfect circle end? In the course of only 3 episodes, Shirley finds out who he is, tries to kill him but fails, and he uses the Geass to make her forget everything about him, Zero and her father. \nWhat I had expected to be a long-running set of intrigue is solved in only 3 episodes with Lelouch essentially using a Deus Ex Machina to solve the emotional conundrum. He's literally throwing the ball out of the field and going \"meh, can't play, it's out\", can't feel guilty or fight Shirley.\nThis is what I meant earlier when I talked about masterpieces and lack of vision. Code Geass had a perfect circle, the Gentle Dead, the Tragic Vengeful, and the Evil Hero. Then instead of going all the way to the end and putting Lelouch in front of the terrible choice of killing Shirley, dying, or managing to stay hidden forever, we just Deus Ex Machina out of it and we move on.\nIt's disappointing.\nIt's even more disappointing for the last arc, too.\nThe last arc features something that literally brought this anime from an overall 9 to a 8. Code Geass would've still been great if not for THAT awful part. What happens can only be described as the plot equivalent of someone stumbling into a rock on the mountains SO HARD that the rock starts an avalanche that kills 50000 people. Yes it looks stupid, and yes it took me out of the anime very very badly.\n(spoilers)\nWhat really happens is that Zero/Lelouch is essentially beaten by Princess Euphemia. He admits defeat and accepts her conditions. Then SUDDENLY the Geass starts going haywire, EXACTLY when they're alone with no witnesses, EXACTLY when they're about to make a semblance of peace and give some independence to the Japanese, EXACTLY when Lelouch says \"I could have you kill all Japanese if I wanted to\".\nI liked Code Geass a lot despite its weaknesses up to now. Several times I felt like it wasn't making that much sense or wasn't that fun, but it always managed to eventually give me a satisfying enough explanation later on, and it always made me want to keep watching.\nBut that part? That really hurt. It felt like shit scenario if I've ever seen one. I think Code Geass, being an anime-only product, with no manga, or novel of any kind behind it, may have lacked the important point of view of a writer who's only in it for the story and dialogue. That kind of focus often helps to build much more sensible and deep stories, and I'm not saying that Code Geass isn't deep, but it sometimes lacks sense or believability, and that part around the end really got to me in the worst way. I was disappointed, annoyed almost, and felt like it came out of nowhere. Never before was the Geass mentioned as \"faulty\".\nIt's also bad for reasons beyond plot: this is the second time where the responsability wasn't on Lelouch. With Shirley's arc they essentially threw the ball out of the park. The question to \"what do you do in that situation\" was never answered. Just Deus Ex'd out. With the ending arc however, the question was never even asked. Lelouch didn't do anything, the Geass did it himself. Where are my deep questions about power, responsability, and the great choices of meagre peace or great war? What of the huge symbolism of killing the people who are essentially the good and gentle ones? What is the meaning of Lelouch's actions when he was essentially put before the fact and didn't really choose anything?\nIn ideology-driven stories, the most fascinating is observing the distance between dream and reality, between the promise and the realisation. What Lelouch becomes, how he fails his original idea, is a slow growth for the most part, but the key, defining element that changes him entirely doesn't happen because he chose it, nor because of his ideology. It just happens because the scenario demanded it.\nAnd that was a huge letdown.\nIt's still a very good anime, with deep intrigue and lots of flaws that are brushed over by the main themes and ideas thrown in there. It's enjoyable both at the beginning by appreciating the two main guys' points of view and thinking them over, and by the end for all the fighting between very opposite friends. It has a surprising, enjoyable and well-thought twist at almost every episode. Its characters are relatable and admirable in lots of ways, and almost everyone including the side folk pitch in with their own flavor of relatable, admirable or hateable personalities.\nBut it's not great. It Deus Ex Machinas out of bad situations, it disappoints, it sometimes just isn't that interesting with all the unwarranted school stuff and teenager crap inbetween a generally very serious and thought-out political intrigue story.\nAbsolutely worth watching. Definitely not worth worshipping.\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=18, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I had originally watched part of the first episode of this series with little expectations, as other mecha series such as Gundam Seed had left an impression on me. One might call this a mecha anime, but the reason you'll love it is so much more than that.\nStory: This story is without a doubt the greatest thing I've ever experienced. The concept of all the secrecy and involvement of Lelouch's friends is very interesting, and it's not very often you find a very popular anime about rebellion against a kingdom in a modern world that is taking over everywhere. My realization of how wonderful the\n          \n        story is handled came along towards the end.\nArt: I'm not much one to take into account an anime series' animation style, but it is indeed very good looking.\nSound: Again, I don't really compare musical scores to different anime series, but some of this series' ending and opening themes were particularly good.\nCharacter: Now this is another reason that makes it so amazing, the character development. It's rather amazing to look back at the first episode and see how much it's all changed. The interaction between the characters because of the story elements is truly different, and I have yet to see anything that is better at this. There is one part of the series involving Lelouch using the Geass on someone, and it was just so non-stereotypical in the way the events turn out it amazed me.\nEnjoyment: This series is very enjoyable, mostly because of the story. The endings of individual episodes were also more enjoyable than most other series, as there were a lot of cliff hanger endings that left me awake until two in the morning just because I NEEDED to know what happened. This series really just had a lasting effect of amazing. Every time I've tried to describe the ending to my friends, honestly, the only words that come to me are 'amazing' and 'wow'. This series definitely must be watched by anyone.\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=18, ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I have to say, that Code Geass is one of  the few animes that I can watch over and over again, in jap or dub, and not get bored of it. It still gives me goosbumps everytime I watch it. Even though I know what's going to happen. When I first came across this anime, I wasn't at all interested because it was a mecha show. But, I decided to give it a shot.  While watching Code Geass, I started to fall in love with the story line and the characters.  Also, while watching this anime, I may have become bipolor, due\n          \n        to the fact that for one minute I was yelling at my computer, then was laughing and crying the next. \nThe one thing that I love about this anime, is the character development. As the story progress you become really attach to the characters, as there are many friendships, relationships and betrayal that happens to them. And you see how they change from beginning to end.  \nThe Art in this anime is futuristic and high detail, and doesn't at all looks dull. The opening and closing theme songs are very catchy to sing or hum along to and they place the perfect background audio for specific parts in the anime that makes you want to pay attention. Like in a horror movie.\nIf you've seen Death Note, then the idea between the main characters are the same. Wanting the rid the world of evil. But, the way that Lelouch (*main character*) proceed with the idea is what makes this anime better than D.N. Lelouch exudes a sense of authority while holding a hidden contempt for authority and has a brilliant mind. The guy is smarter than you, knows it and will wait patiently until the exact moment to pummel you down to the ground. What sets Lelouch apart from the dozen other geniuses is his down to earth nature. He may be willing to toy with human lives, but when it comes to his friends and family, he unwittingly shows a more vulnerable side that is distinctly human.\nSo, to wrap up this review, obviously I give this anime a 10 out of 10. Even if you're not the type of person who like mecha shows, I recommend you give this anime a try. I promise you won't be disappointed.\n        "},
			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=7, ["text"]="                          \n    How do you keep that figure if all you ever eat is pizza? Please enlighten me, Coco Chanel.\nStory:\nIt’s Death Note with terrorists. Just kidding, it’s nothing like Death Note at all. Former Britannian prince Lelouch tries to get revenge for his mother’s death by destroying the empire with his terrorist organization. Of course it’s not that simple, not at all. Code Geass is a story about idealism, politics, betrayal and mendacity. How far can you go to reach your goals before you sell out your principals? How far WILL you go? Does the end really justify the means? Is your own ideology worth more than\n          \n        others? Oops, that’s a lot of questions. But Code Geass is not as heavy as other works (like the recently reviewed Ghost in the Shell) and manages to tell a compelling story that doesn’t need you to think too deeply into it (if you don’t want to). This is one of the few anime that manages to serve both sides. Are you interested in ideological conflicts or do you just want to see some cool mecha fights? Why not both? Buy now and get a pizza for free! But as good as Geass is with these things, it isn’t without flaws. There are some interesting plot twists, but they often happen because of coincidences, that can test your suspension of disbelief. When a gust of wind can lead up to the deaths of hundreds, that’s a lot to swallow. A problem of its initial run, that doesn’t exist anymore, was the fact that the story was divided into two separate seasons, even though it was meant to be an ongoing one. At the end of season one, basically nothing is concluded and it ends on a huge cliffhanger. Today of course, you can just watch both back to back, but when it first aired, that must have driven people nuts.\n9/10\nArt:\nThe first thing I noticed was the odd character design. Everybody seems to be incredibly thin, especially the males. Well, it’s a CLAMP anime after all (at least the character design is), so if you’ve seen some of their works before, you will not be too surprised. Besides this, which is more a question of taste than a quality attribute, Geass looks very good. The animation is smooth and the mecha fights are flashy. This show has aged a lot better than many others of its era.\n8/10\nSound:\nLet’s start with the openings and endings. The first opening is very memorable, though it isn’t my personal favourite. The second is pretty bad, but the third is very good again. It’s the most fitting as well. The first ending is horrible, simply horrible. I didn’t think Ali Project could “top” their terrible Another opening, but this is even worse. I hate it (yes, I know that Geass is older, but I watched Another first). The second one was much better, though still not my cup of tea. The voice acting was solid, some of them pretty good. Jun Fukuyama does a nice job with Lelouchs maniacal monologues, but the crazy laugh does not really hit. Mamoru Miyano did that better in Death Note. Oops, now I did a comparison after all. My bad.\n6/10\nCharacters:\n Code Geass is full of characters. Okay, that’s a weird sentence, but really, there are tons of em. Our protagonist is Lelouch, an incredibly cocky guy, who acquires a neat supernatural power that lets him command anybody to do whatever he tells them to do. With this he decides to start a revolution (hence the name of the series) to destroy Britannia. His high intelligence gets him far, but he still makes mistakes along the way due to him believing in his own invulnerability. Despite having somewhat good intentions, he clearly loses sight along the way, though it’s up to the viewer to decide when exactly he crosses that line into villainy. Or is he still a hero to you? His counterpart is a a guy called Suzaku, who despite being the subject of racism and oppression fights for the regime that hates him so much. I don’t get him, what exactly does he try to accomplish? He says he wants to change Britannia from within, but how on Earth is that going to play out? He is easily the biggest hypocrite in the entire show. For example, he keeps saying how he doesn’t want to fight or hurt anybody, yet he is an elite soldier, constantly killing rebels. What a joke. He is supposed to be the other side of the coin of Lelouch, but there is nothing likeable or heroic or logical about Suzaku. They wasted a perfect opportunity to present an equally questionable character on the other side of the battlefield and have us choose who is in the right or not. With Suzaku, it’s at least very obvious who’s in the wrong.\nThe rebels are divided into different factions, some more traditionalistic, some more terrorists than rebels. The main focus is on Lelouchs group called the Black Knights. These people aren’t very heroic at first, being driven entirely by hatred towards the Britannians, making them no better than their oppressors. Lelouch turns them into a group of “justice warriors”, which most of them seem to enjoy, either because of the fame or because they really wanted to be like that in the first place and just didn’t know how to do it. Kallen is such a person. A determined and able fighter, who develops a devotion towards her leader like a father figure. She is your typical hot-blooded amazon, but unlike others of her kind, she is able to think before acting. The royal family was raised into power-hungry and narcissistic maniacs, who do anything to keep their power and have no qualms to terrorize civilians. As we get to know through the few scenes with the king, that is exactly how he wants them to be and only few managed to withstand this inhuman upbringing, namely Lelouch, his little sister and Euphemia. Euphy is kind of like a personification of blind idealism. Much like Suzaku, she wants to change the system without resorting to violence, but unlike him, she is in a position where this is at least somewhat possible. She reminds me a lot of Princess Diana and how the world saw her as the down-to-earth, humanitarian member of the snobbish, cold British royal family. While there are multiple characters that are clearly evil, she seems to be the only one who is purely good.\nAlmost done. Finally, we have the student council. They are a heavy contrast to the dark and serious theme of Code Geass and could be ripped right out of any random slice of life anime. Despite them being somewhat of forced comic relief, I felt that they add well into the show. After all, Lelouch is trying to live a double life and one of that is that of a normal student. The fact that one of them has an obvious crush on him makes things a lot less easy for our genius, which I thought was a nice idea. Shirley is also one of the few anime girls who doesn’t try to deny her feelings at all costs, which was very refreshing. Now, have I forgotten somebody? Oh, right, that immortal girl who eats pizza all day and doesn’t really help Lelouch despite helping him a lot. CC is a big X factor and her true intentions as well as her background are always left vague. A very interesting character, who will probably become a lot more important in the second half of this anime.\n8/10\nEnjoyment:\nCode Geass does a very good job at staying away from clichés and genre standards that so many other other anime fall victim to. The world building, the story progress and the forming of conflicts between multiple factions, characters and ideologies were done incredibly well. On top of that, the pacing is wonderful. There is always something going on, but you never feel knocked over by it. Sometimes it feels a little constructed, but if you can look past that, Code Geass is an incredibly entertaining anime that you can easily binge if you want to.\n9/10\nOverall:\n8.0/10\n        "},

I get it. You guys just love Code Geass!\n*Sigh* Even before I started to watch a lot of anime like I do nowadays about a year ago, I knew about Code Geass. It's just one of those great 00's Animes like Death Note (that actually were emitted at the same time), Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann, Samurai Champloo, Full Metal Alchemist,\n          \n        Ergo Proxy, Welcome to the NHK, etc. And well... I thinks I was expecting more.\nIf there's one word that would describe Code Geass for me that would be: Melodramatic. Honestly, I have seen \"Telenovelas\" less dramatic that this series. I have only watched the first episode of Season 2, but in Season 1 they pretty much forced a lot to feel something, without a proper construction.\nOne of the things that I expected the most were brilliant plans by Zero, similar to the ones from Kira in Death Note... And well for me that never happens, the only time that I can see a plan similar to Kira is the one to (Spoiler) save her sister Nunnally from Mao. (End Spoiler) And it's just amazing how they ruin everything so fast, I mean, the construction itself by the end-half the season is quite good, and it has some amazing scenes, but oh my god do they ruin every scene in the end at the worst way possible. For example, the fact that (Spoiler) Shirley knows about Zero, the way the arc ended while it was quite good, the way they continued the story was just mediocre. While I can see how the strategy worked for Lelouch at the beginning by convincing everyone, the fact that they never ask a thing to her it's just shockingly stupid. (End Spoiler) Something that I loved from Death Note was that with these types of situations, Light tried his best to get out of them while taking a risk to get more involved in it, a bigger lie to cover a lie and so on, in Code Geass this never happens. Another really good scene is when (Spoiler) Zero kills Euphemia, this scene is actually really good, but by God does the production of it it's stupid, I mean seriously a fucking sentence that he didn't wanted to say and boom, everything fucked up. I cringed and watch the following scene in little jumps because I was ashamed of watching this. In the end, when Zero kills her, he says that she was probably his first love... Are you fucking serious!? We never had a romantic scene between you, not even as kids, I believe Shirley was more your first fu***** first love. (End spoiler). While you can see some decent military tactics, at least 3 times Lelouch is saved by luck *cof* *cof* C.C. *cof* *cof*. Which comes the next point.\nThere are actually some pretty good characters and construction of them, such as C.C., Mao and Shirley, but they are wasted by the end or how they act in the end and doesn’t let them appreciate them. The episodes where Mao appears are for me the best ones that this series have. But again, the strategies from Lelouch are not quite good, for example (Spoiler) If Mao could read the mind… What happens if you think in another language? Apparently Lelouch is good in English and they’re speaking Japanese, what would have happen? Or any other language. Other thing is in the last game of chess… If everything reduced to the weight of the pieces why not simply put yourself in the balance to deactivate the bomb? Because as far as I know, if he got the balance to be in his favor because of the weight, he would deactivate the bomb, and yes, it might have not work out, but I’m just surprised that this obvious option was never mentioned (End Spoiler). Yet, the romance is relatively good in this series, not anything exceptional but certainly not bad.\nI consider an insult (at least in this first season) to compare Lelouch and Light, it’s pretty obvious that in getting information and doing a plan with it, Light is WAY better than Lelouch, otherwise, Lelouch would have known in short time that Suzaku was the pilot of Lancelot.\nAnyway, CodeGeass has a relatively good construction, and some great scenes, but these scenes don’t last too much because of the execution that they follow and plot armor Lelouch has. This is why I consider Code Geass to be tolerable, not bad, but certainly not good.\nI really hope it gets better in Season 2, and by the scores it appearently is.\n        "},

The arts and sound degree of the anime are next to brilliant, with a good incorporation of \"Insert Songs\" and great animations.\nSTORY: The way in which Britannia is\n          \n        portrayed, is nothing short of an Empire of the roman times, effortlessly landing, attacking and claiming land. Set in the Year 2010 a.t.b, or \"Ascension Throne Britannia,\" when the Holy Britannian Empire waged war and conquered Japan. With this, Japan is now a formal colony of the settlement now known as \"Area Eleven\" and it's people referred to as \"Elevens.\" Starting 7 years after this invasion with Lelouch Lamperouge, is Ex-Prince of Britannia, but he relinquished his name, title and right to succeed the throne after he saw the true face of the Empire and it's biter indiference. The story moves at a steady pace at most times, constantly showing a \"war,\" whether it be with Britannia, with himself or his friends and family. At the best of times, you are gaining answers to questions that arise in the mere first seconds of the series, at the worst, you find yourself asking new questions but that is all part of the draw for Code Geass. It is that, \"Now why is that\" & \"Who did this,\" that really makes for a thinking anime. Mind you, there are no times when your are bombarded by answers, nor are you given a huge heap of questions to think about. They are all delivered in due time. \nARTWORK/ANIMATION: Sunshine has always made for great animation, showing what the cutting-edge of Anime Animations are capable of. Code Geass is no exception to this rule, with many great designs and background artwork. I would like to pay special attention to the \"Knightmare\" frames however, as they earn extra-special credit from me because of all of the eye-candy that follows them wherever they go. Their animation seems so fluent, that it almost looks like they could exist. Another extra-special credit is in the special CG effects. I will use the Hadron-Cannon as an example because even though it is not a drawing as such, it's light and shimmer effects make for a dangerous-looking beam.\nSOUND/MUSIC: The sound effects of this series, are so-so. At times, they are realistic and lively but at other times, they are really repetitive. The quality of these sounds, regardless of the repetitiveness, is perfect. When someone is walking, it sounds like they are walking right-beside you. When a Knightmare frame is attacking, it sounds lively, and large. The Insert-Songs work well. They do fit really nicely with the entire theme of the Anime. For example, when Lelouch is thinking really solemnly, this sort of solo Trumpeter accompanied by Cellos is heard, making for the music to not be overwhelming. My favorite insert-song is the one heard at almost all Britannia-related parties and speeches. It is a majestic-sounding song sung by a choir of men. With this, you get the sense of \"Britannia, it's a large, big, majestic, overwhelming Empire.\" The Voice-Acting and casting was also perfect. Jun Fukuyama played an excellent part as Lelouch and in using one, quieter voice for his school friends and then this big, deep voice for when he is \"Zero\" is simply inspired. And then there's C.C who was played by Yukana Nogami, even her voice suits C.C's solemn character. Overall, great sound selection.\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL: I really did enjoy this anime. It had just the right mix of serious, meaningful elements with a comedy backdrop (At times.) With this combination, it surely wasn't going to go wrong and I'm glad it didn't, because it was just soooo enjoyable. People will watch this anime for times to come and still think \"Wow, I wonder if that would occur if such an event had taken place.\" Although mind-you, I'm sure that there wouldn't be any Geass...\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=16, ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I've never thought I would enjoy Code Geass so much. At first I said that this military-robot thing would never suit my taste, but unlike my expectations it was totally awesome. What I really loved were the characters, especially Lelouch. Now when it comes to Lelouch, either you love him or you hate him. I particularly love him. He's one hell of a badass who's always one step ahead the others. Although he played the role of the villain in the most part of the series, in the end he turned out to be truly good and this is the reason why Code Geass is\n          \n        awesome.\nSpeaking a little about the graphics, they are really good. You can actually see a lot of details, there's also a large variety of both lively and dark colours, so I really don't have anything to complain about. The voices of the characters suit them perfectly as if they are real and the background sound is more than ok.\nDespite the non-stop action, the drama is another important component of the anime. The emotions you feel (from love to hatred, happiness to sadness etc) and idk, the whole \"with great power comes great responsibility\" thing is constantly present in each episode and I guess it's there to remind us that we all started from the bottom.\nI enjoyed this anime to the fullest. Everything. War tactics, mixed feelings, power over friends. Everything. Leloouch is pure genius and I need to say that thanks to this character the anime is so great.\n        "},

I'll get straight to the points:\nADDICTIVENESS- 10.  It's hard to stop watching the show, it does a good job of compelling you to watch the next episode.  That's not enough to make the show good, but it's something.\nSTORY - 3 The similarity with death note is the characters have different philosophies, but what they want is ultimately a good world, a good thing (they just have different ideas of how to get there).  Unfortunately, I think the twists in this story go\n          \n        way to far, and the main character does atrocious things for selfish reasons.  We see characters twisted by their trauma, sometimes in an almost elfen leid kind of way.  \nCHARACTERS -3.  There are some pretty fleshed out characters,  but this is a show that takes things too far and gives us characters to hate.  At first, you can kind of understand him and where he's coming from, but he takes things too far and doesn't consider alternatives.  If you like to have a character you can hate, then Lelouch you.  The rest of us will be repulsed.\nMusic - 10.  The way they used music is one of the best things about the show.  Excellent job.\nArt - 10.  I'm not overly critical of art - it was good and enjoyable.\nOverall enjoyment - 0.  You end up hating or feeling detached from almost every major character.  There's nothing enjoyable about that.  There are no morals to be learned, and ultimately nothing to redeem the downhill this show takes.\n        "},

			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=11, ["text"]="\n                          \n    When I first watched this season of Code Geass, I said, \"There is no way that season 2 could be better.\" I was wrong, and that is the main reason that this anime did not get higher than a 9. I initially thought that this anime was flawless, but then I heard the second opening and watched the second season. The character development and cast is fantastic. Lelouch, the main character, is enjoyable and his friends and partners, The Black Knights, are memorable as well. The story is compelling and nerve wracking. While watching this anime, you will feel several emotions: joy, sadness, anger, and\n          \n        even fear at times, all up until the major cliffhanger at the end that will have you begging for the next season (which I watched immediately after). However, all of these things are overshadowed by the second season. The near perfect story is actually perfected for R2 and new, even more memorable characters are introduced. It was just impossible for me to give them both the same rating. However this does not draw away from the enjoyment factor, as it is equally as gripping, and after all it is necessary if season 2 were to make any sense. To me, those are the most important details, but Code Geass has some missteps in art and sound. The character models took me a while to get used to, and the Knightmares looked like they came straight from Cowboy Bebop which came out in the 90s. However, the hadron cannon and the Geass power both looked good and I became accustomed to the weird character models after a while. The sound was great in the show, and the first opening is one of my favorites, but the second opening and the repetitive sounds really bothered me. The second opening is terrible and I found myself skipping it and then listening to the first one just to make up for how hurt my head was from the annoying voice. As for the repetitive sounds, every time Lelouch would use his Geass, the same track would play. EVERY time, and he uses it a lot. A similar thing happens when C.C is on the screen. Overall, this anime is very good and should definitely be watched. I would call this a must watch even for the sole purpose of watching season 2, but aside from that, it is still a great anime.\n        "},
			{["score"]=6, ["helpful"]=6, ["text"]="                          \n    First off, this anime ends horribly. People talk about anime suddenly ending with no resolution. Sometimes they overreact – Deadman Wonderland and Attack on Titan end an arc but keep the big story unfinished. It’s frustrating, since the arcs are integral to a bigger story and don’t stand on their own. Code Geass, however, simply ends. Worse, it ends on a cliffhanger. I know there’s a second season, but you don’t separate seasons (Or episodes, or books) for the sake of it. You separate them because they’re different stories. This one’s unfinished and this is a huge blow.\nMore news at 11.\nAt first, it’s tempting to\n          \n        view the anime as exploration of Japan under Western influence. World War II wasn’t so long ago, and we all heard about how the Japanese are poor victims. This story is false, and bones have a way of digging themselves out. Japan was an aggressor in WWII and responsible for some true horrors. So seeing a story in which they are oppressed can be bizarre – you have to wonder whether in the world of Code Geass they found the bones in Shinjiku. The big Western oppressor this time is the UK, whose main contribution to the world after WWII was Big Beat and Dubstep.\nIt’s not about politics. The Geass is a physical manifestation of power. The creators wisely chose to never talk about how it actually works. There’s no D&D-esque magic system behind it, only a few limits to help us understand power better. A Geass is limited, because power comes in different forms. A Geass can also be used once, but can consume you.\nPower doesn’t just come in isolation. Something drives power. The user wants to achieve something with that power. We hear about how some people just want to feel powerful, but why do they want to feel powerful? Powerful is ability and security. Power cannot be an end. If it is an end, it is only because power is the means to get many ends. Power never stands alone.\nHere’s your main problem with the anime. Power here stands alone. Excluding Euphie, the story is an ordinary one about oppressed people rising against their overseers, but so what? What does the British empire stand for? What do the Japanese stand for? You cannot just kill the tyrant but have to replace it with something. A person once said that anarchy is a ‘tyranny of people with guns’. Since humans are pack animals, leaders come by naturally and can be good for us. Leaders work differently, though even when they seem similar. Both the Nazis and the Japanese did unethical human experiments, but for different ends.\nThe series is soaked by the theme of power. The position of every character is established quickly, and is an important part of everyone’s lives. Notice how Rivalz is obviously inferior to Lelouch, how no woman swoon over him and he’s mostly just there. During high school scenes, we follow the most powerful people – the student council whose head is the daughter of the principle. Lelouch is a person who lost his position of power and that’s the same story for Jeremiah. Cornelia’s and Euphemia’s relationship isn’t just about protecting the little sister – one is clearly more powerful than the other.\nIt’s a fantastic stage to test what drives power and they squash it. The two sides fighting stand for nothing. Many stories use the typical Hitler-esque tyrant, which is cliched but at least something. Here, the British Empire only protect its own existence without ever answering why it exists in the first place. The Japanese want to free themselves, but they only free themselves into a vague ‘equality’ thing.\nThen again, it’s not a story of simple evil vs. simple good. Many scenes show us the Britinnians, their lives and how they’re actual human beings. The inclusion of school life comedy is brilliant. It shows us there are people behind the oppressors who might be used to their lives of privilege, but they’re still people. When everything falls apart, there’s no sadism but empathy towards the upper class.\nIf the creators can write vibrant scenes about everyday life, why can’t they imbue their characters with motives and ideologies? Relationships with the same structure work differently. Both Lelouch and Cornelia protect their little sisters, but Lelouch is the soft warm protector whereas Cornelia is the condescending one. A small character arc involving Jeremiah – a clear villain and an asshole – shows us the pain of falling from a position of power. Even while the series sides with Lelouch, it doesn’t shy away from how his power can hurt his enemies.\nThe ‘Grand Purpose’ is integral to any piece of art. Everything connects to it, and it makes the flaws more understandable. Without the grand purpose, there is nothing to review. Even shows whose only purpose is to show big boobs have this purpose. Often, average shows swing between two such purpose and commit. Code Geass doesn’t even swing between purposes but simply doesn’t have one. It goes through the motions, provides good storytelling that leads nowhere.\nCredit must go to the designers. The series sports one of the best character design I’ve seen. As pure beauty few anime match it. In fact, the characters are so beautiful that it feels like a plot point. Everyone radiates sex appeal, but somehow no one has sex with anyone. The overly-slender bodies do contrast with this. They’re not just thin but long, but every face is plastic-surgery perfect. Every stare is full of confidence with sensual lips. Even the voice-actors give a sexual smugness to it all. CC and Milly always sound teasing, like they’re just about to invite you to their rooms. It’s nice, but sometimes bizarre.\nIt’s also fairly expressive. Notice the contrast in design between Lelouch and Suzaku. Suzaku has a softer, cuter look with the curly hair. Lelouch has sharp eyes, black hair that falls in spikes. These designs amplifies their personalities. Rivalz is being stuck with a goofy blue hairdo. The decision to give characters similar but different hair colors is meaningful. Euphy’s pink is brighter than Cornelia’s purple, just like their personality.\nThe gigantic robots don’t fare so well. The action scenes are a constant thorn in the anime. Although there are emotional moments in those scenes, they take the chess game technique to the extreme. They become more about Lelouch’s genius rather than the characters. Imagine JoJo but with giant robots. JoJo was nice, but its storytelling was built for shallow stories driven by excitement. Here, the storytelling always aims for something deeper. If the robots had a cool look to them, then fine. The designers went full lazy and just had gigantic hulks of metal with arms and legs. None of the imagination that fuels the character design (A character who appears for a barely a minute looks better than most anime characters) reaches them.\nContrast this anime with Future Diary. It’s another overly ambitious anime with so much going on it couldn’t flesh it all out. When Future Diary tackles an idea, it does so with full conviction. It may need more length, but when it’s about comedy it’s all about comedy. When it’s horror, it’s all horror. More importantly, Future Diary wasn’t about build-up but about arcs. Each arc had its own style. All of the elements in Geass aren’t spread evenly but crammed together into one gigantic arc that builds up to a huge climax. There is very little resolution in this anime. Some may enjoy the cliffhangers, the ‘what’ll happen next?’ but that’s boring. The most exciting anime are those that are exciting because what’s happening, in the present tense. They’ll keep you coming back.\nCode Geass fails only because what it set out to do is be the best anime ever. It’s overall a good show with a dynamic story and a wide cast, each with their own point of view. Although it slips often to cheap thriller mode, the characters’ personality dominate it more than conventions. Even if it’s not the best anime ever, most creators can’t even attempt something this ambitious.\n3 sexy homosapiens out of 5\n        "},
			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=6, ["text"]="                          \n    Code Geass I feel had the potential to be a truly great Anime, but sadly fell just short of that mark.   \nStory: 8.5 \n My best description of the show is that it is a mix of Death Note (smart main character, morally ambiguous path to achieve his goals and its emphasis on battles of wits situations) and Gurren Lagann (mostly for the mech suits and the ever increasing amount of side characters on both sides of the conflict). The story and it's flow are surprisingly methodical, with interesting twists and reveals as the show progresses. It really takes its time in a\n          \n        good way to flesh out all its characters and their motivations throughout, while also introducing new developments and characters seamlessly (for the most part). Surprisingly, my biggest complaint with the story is that it does get bogged down a bit with less interesting side plots involving certain side characters that feel a little tired by the end of the show. Also when the show delves more into the Geass side stories I feel they detract from the plot, and are rather uninteresting due to some reveals which really lessens the uniqueness of the power. The more comedic episodes I feel are not only out of place in this anime due to its tone and mood, but also serve to detract from the plot as well, even though the humor for the most part is pretty good. \nCharacters: 9\nThis is where the anime really shines. For how big the cast becomes it does a very good job on developing them and providing their motivations. There isn't really any character I felt were poorly done (at worst some can be a bit bland), which is very surprising. Lelouch himself isn't your bland stereotypical main character, he feels like a real person and the way they handle his development throughout the series is rather  impressive. Of course, as with every anime there will be your stereotypical types (mostly Lelouch's school friends) but they for the most part are handled well enough that it doesn't really get bug me at all. Speaking on this season alone, the villains and antagonists are good to great depending, with the main antagonist being a very good foil to Lelouch due to their difference of points of view and life experience. \nArt and Sound : 8\nI'm not really an expert when it comes to this sort of stuff, so take whatever I say here with a grain of salt. The anime looks and sounds very good, I enjoy the character models and the fight scenes are very nicely animated. I really enjoy the first op and the music throughout the series,  which made every big battle even more epic.\nEnjoyment and Overall rating: 8.5\nThe show at times can be a blast to watch, with great cliff hangers forcing you to watch a bit more then you were planning to that day. Unfortunately due to the frequency of the mech fights and how long the season is, they do begin to become a bit tedious and repetitive in terms of circumstance and end result which does hurt my enjoyment a bit. Overall, Code Geass has a great story with great and interesting characters throughout. Repetitive fights, out of place comedy and distracting side plots keep the show from receiving a 9 rating. I still highly recommend it. This is my first ever review so I hope it was helpful!  "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=11, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    You know that meme \"Lie down, Try not to cry, Cry a lot\"? Ah, that's how I felt in the end of the second season of this anime. I mean while watching, I cried. I watched it tomorrow again and I cried again. I even watched it in German dub and cried. German dub, you know how ridiculous that sounds. I waited a long time for a \"Masterpiece \" anime like this, and finally I was able to rate a show as a 10/10 on MAL. May I present you the best anime I've seen so far. CODE GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion.\n Plot and\n          \n        Story Line\nGuys, I guarantee you this will be the best anime story you'll ever watch. It doesn't lack in any aspect of a good anime. The story is intriguing, the plot is smooth and the main story line is just perfect. Also it didn't lack in good background stories at all. Goro Taniguchi, the Original Creator of Code Geass, has an ingenuity I've never seen in my life before. And I wanna say thanks for giving us this anime. I have to admit that I was rather sceptical whether I'd like it or not, but thank God I did. Now let's see what the story actually looks like.\nWell, in 2010 the Holy Empire of Britannia began a campaign of conquest, with Japan as its target. Because of the advanced armour technology of Britannia, Japan was soon taken over and its pride, rights and identity were gone. Now its called Area 11 and its citizens, the Elevens, are forced on a harsh life while the Britannian aristocracy lives and opulent and luxuriant life. One of the aristocrats is Lelouch Lamperouge that lives together with his little sister Nunnally. What nobody knows about them, they both are an exiled Prince and Princess of Britannia. His life as a normal High School student ends after he meets C.C. by accident. A rather strange girl that gives him the Power of the King. The Geass. With the power of dominance over any person Lelouch starts his fight against Britannia with the wish to bring down Britannia from the inside. I won't tell you the reason he did that, I want you to find it out on your own while watching. \nThere are a few acpects of the show regarding the story that have to be mentioned.\nFirst of all, THE ACTION. The whole Code Geass story is basicly a revolution so of curse there will be a lot of action. I was sceptical in the beginning whether I will like those robot like human-armor but after watching I few episodes I fell in love. True I saw those in Guilty Crown too but I didn't pay that much atention on them. The battles are epic, interesting and although Lelouch is such a master-mind he wasn't winning all the time. \nSecond thing, THE PLOT TWISTS. This made me crazy. I mean, so many things happened in this anime that I thought were impossibe to happen. Aaaagh! One plot twist happened in the end, and that's the thing that made me cry. Me, cry. I've never cried before. Not even in Angle Beats. But I did cry here. Hat down for that.\nThirdly, THE EMOTIONALITY. Whether it is a romance, or sibling/friend love, hatred, excitement, sadness, obedience, patriotism...Everything is there and it's manifested to the very maximum. You should see that emotion breakouts, it really gives you goose bumps. I am not kidding.\nForth, and last thing. Tell me one thing that anime makers usually get wrong. Well, mostly it is theSECOND HALF, or even the whole SECOND SEASON. I was so scared that this would happen to Code Geass, but...It did not. The second season was even better than the first one and episode for episode the story got more and more interesting. \nCode Geass is an example of how an anime should be. Interesting, catchy, with a smooth story yet having some surprises prepared. But please anime makers, don't do the Guilty Crown thing. Just don't. \nCharacters\nThis anime's characters are maybe one of the best I have seen. They are so unique and there are not a lot cliche personalities that you see in other anime. What I mostly liked about the main characters are their flaws. The imperfection of their personality. It gave the show a little extra and a fresh scent. Here are the four of the main characters for you:\nLELOUCH: His main problem was that he wanted to acheive his goal trough the goal of others. A mastermind I've never seen before. I envied him on his care for Nunnally and cleverness of curse. A very rational character with clear goals not affraid of taking risks. The only thing I don't get is how I can hate and love Lelouch at the same time. I really cant say. That's why, as a character, brilliant.\nKALLEN kinda reminds me of Touka from Tokyo Ghoul. A strong, independent, badass woman that knows what she is fighting for. I, my self, am a great patriot, and that's the common characteristic we share. She became one of my \"idol-characters\" after watching this anime. And with great extent, one of my favorite characters ever.\nSUZAKU: Although he looks like the cutest character of all, I hated him. How could you fight your own people? I don't get it. He was not scared of Britannia, he was just too naive. I know I can't blame you for that. But I certanly can for betraying your best friend. Not cool at all.\nAnd in the end...I am sorry for saying this, but this woman is a bit*h. C.C. is so self-centerd and evil, I mean making a contract with someone without telling him the outcome. Come on! Too bad she fell in love and regretted what she has done. It's a bit too late in the end, but she managed it somehow with Lelouch's help. Still, I have to admit, I loved her. Her personality fitted just right in all those happenings.\nAnimation and Style\nAaaam...again, there is not much to talk about animation. It is very good, no flaws. When it comes to the animation style I must say that it is a bit different. I mean you can see it on the character looks. Still it is not bad at all, and why not be a bit unique. One more thing I need to mention here are the sound and music. Both opening and ending songs are great an the music inside the anime is brilliant. I really enjoyed it.\nConclusion\nI can't believe this review beacame so long, but an anime like Code Geass maybe deserves even a longer one. The thing is that this show is perfect in every aspect possible. Story, plot, characters, emotions, action, animation, style, music...Every Single Thing is perfect! If you haven't watched Code Geass, go! Right Now! It's an order! I loved Code Geass, and I haven't met a single person yet that doesn't. I'd really like to know if there is a single person that doesn't like this anime. Let me know if you know someone. \nIn short, Code Geass is truly a MASTERPIECE!\nYour AnimeGirl \n        "},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=11, ["text"]="                          \n    Critic’s Log – August 10, 2015. Review #96: Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion.\n7 years have passed since I first watched this particular anime, this was a fond memory of my high school days. Well, it is time that I review this series at last. This is CODE GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion!\n\nThe Empire of Britannia has invaded Japan using giant robot weapons known as the Knightmare Frames. Japan is now referred to as Area 11, and its people are called “Elevens”. A Britannian , Lelouch, vowed to his Japanese friend Suzaku that he would one day destroy Britannia. Years later, Lelouch is in high\n          \n        school, but regularly skips out of school to go play chess and gamble on himself. One day, he gets himself caught in the mix with terrorists who've stolen a military secret who happens to be a young girl, and she gives Lelouch the power of Geass, which makes anyone obey any order.\n\nCode Geass ran from October of 2006 until July of 2007 and this is a Sunrise production and the animation is not half bad in this anime. There are some little flubs such as miniscule use of recycled animation, some odd effects, but the animation still holds up. It may not be on par with the animation quality of Death Note, but the animation quality in Code Geass still holds up today. The openings look fine, the closings are nice to look at, and the Knightmares’ design are unique. Speaking of unique, the character design is done by a well-known Manga group known as CLAMP (known for titles such as Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle, xxxHolic, X, Magic Knight Rayearth, and Cardcaptor Sakura). Some may not like the character designs because the characters in Code Geass look like anorexic figures. I actually never had a problem since the character design was unique in the series. By the way, Code Geass is not the only series with this distinct style. Some of CLAMP’s other works have that so-called “Anorexic” design. I should point out that CLAMP had no involvement in writing the plot, all they did was the character designs. Now if there is one issue with the animation, it would be the product placement of Pizza Hut. I am aware that Pizza Hut sponsored the show but it is a little distracting when product placement is used in the way Code Geass shows it. Now if you reside in America and have watched it on DVD or something, you might not get what I mean. For those that are not aware. The American release took out the Pizza Hut sign whenever it was shown in the series to likely prevent legal issues. Look on the bright side, at least Coca-Cola didn’t add to this… You know… Coca-Cola Zero. Anyway, The animation’s excellent.\n\nThe music by Hitomi Kuroishi and Kotaro Nakagawa is worth noting, No matter what they did before and since. Code Geass will be their high note. They may have been involved in titles like Gun x Sword and Planetes, but Code Geass’ soundtrack is often energetic, light, and epic. The soundtrack is used well but it does have some moments where it is used on bad timing. What I mean is that there are some scenes that the viewer can tell that something is going to go down and a scene that sounds calm and carefree is not really the best time to use in a scene that is building up to a big sequence. The soundtrack is well-done, but it has some odd placements at times. As for openings, the first one which is “COLORS” by FLOW is probably the most memorable in the series because of its catchy tune. “Kaidoku Funo” by Jinn took me a while to adjust but it is also catchy but I liked the first opening more. Now this anime had a third opening but it was only used in the last two episodes. “Hitomi no Tsubasa” by Access sounds cool but vocal-wise… it’s okay, I don’t have much to say on this opening. As for closings. “Yukyo Seishunwa” by Ali Project is catchy, but I actually like the second closing “Mosaic Kakera” by SunSet Swish. I should note that the last episode of this season originally had the first opening theme “Colors” as its ending theme but if you reside in America, The closing theme in the last episode would be Mosaic Kakera. I don’t know why this is the case but I would assume because the epilogue doesn’t really add much. The epilogue was contained in the DVD release but as an extra and it was never dubbed. Oh well.\nNow we get to voice acting. Starting with the original Japanese cast. Jun Fukuyama got a lot of praise for this role and I cannot deny that this was a big role for him. He did win best Male lead in the first Seiyu Awards in 2007. Even though his performance was award-winning, I still remember Jun Fukuyama best as Lelouch. Takahiro Sakurai may have hundreds of roles and I never found him to be a bad seiyu but I found his performance overacted at times. Yukana is great as C.C. (pronounced C2). Ami Koshimizu is fine as Kallen. As for the English Dub. Johnny Yong Bosch took me a while to get used to. This is due to how much I did enjoy Jun Fukuyama’s performance but Johnny Yong Bosch might not sit well with everybody at first. He is a good voice actor, don’t get me wrong. Johnny Yong Bosch sounded like he took a couple episodes to really get into the role, he does improve much greatly as the series progresses. As for Suzaku Kururugi, he is voiced by Yuri Lowenthal in the dub and he is terrific here. I enjoyed his part in the show. Karen Strassman does fine with Kallen, as for C.C., Kate Higgins may not be as pitch-perfect as Yukana but for the Dub alone, Kate Higgins is great. Amy Kincaid doesn’t do much voice acting but she captured Shirley’s character well, just as well as Fumiko Orikasa. Now the Dub of Code Geass has a lot of big names in Dubbed Anime. Code Geass’ dub included names like Kirk Thornton, Laura Bailey, Liam O’Brien, Michael Lindsay, Stephanie Sheh, Michelle Ruff, Peter Spellos, Sam Regal, Steve Staley, Travis Willingham, Troy Baker, Crispin Freeman, and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn. They even got Steve Blum in the dub. Truly, this cast did make it an awesome dub… However there are a few exceptions. Michael McConnohie is a good voice actor and his performance is good but it was not as epic as Norio Wakamoto. I got to be honest. I enjoyed Charles zi Britannia’s Japanese Voice more than his English voice. There is one performance that I did not fully enjoy, and it was Rebecca Forstadt as Nunnally. Kaori Nazuka was great but Rebecca Forstadt sounded like she had a mocking-like tone of voice and I know that was not the intention but the voice never did sit well with me. The person responsible for Code Geass’ dub was the late Kevin Seymour, the man responsible for dubs such as the Ghost in the Shell film, The Pioneer Dub of AKIRA, and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, which are terrific dubs in their own right. Both versions are good, but they both have 1 role I didn’t like. The English voice of Nunnally and the Japanese voice of Jeremiah Gottwald, let’s face it. Crispin Freeman fits the role much more than Ken Narita. That being said, both versions are watchable.\nWhen characters are concerned, it is interesting to see how Lelouch and Suzaku were playing out and they are fine here, Kallen is okay, C.C. is a good for the show’s mystery. For the Japanese side, they are given a more sympathetic side because of the anime’s premise. That is fine and all, as for the Britannian side, some are rewarding to watch, some are not. Shirley is fine, so is Euphy, Lloyd is silly, Cornelia is fascinating, Jeremiah Gottwald is cool, and I am about to flip the tables for some of you because I actually don’t hate Nina… Well, during this season that is. If there is some characters I don’t like. Viletta and Diethard are the two I did not like. Why Viletta? I can’t say but I did not like how she played out in the midway point. As for Diethard, he was a stereotypical Media man. The characters are mostly played out fine, some nitpicking here and there but I didn’t have much to complain about the cast of characters here.\nAs for the plot, I would like to say that I enjoyed 85% of the plot, there are some areas I absolutely hated in this anime but first, I need to address Goro Taniguchi’s directing. There is some flash-forwarding used in this anime and they are sometimes used after an episode cliffhanger. I really did not like it after the second time, it really cheapens the cliffhangers. The humor was fine, except for Stage 6. There is one character I did not mention that I did not like, but let’s just say Stage 16 was unnecessary. Another unnecessary episode was Stage 21 because it focused on Students making a giant pizza. Now I don’t want to ruin a big plot point but I would like to at least mention Stage 22. There is one thing that got overlooked considering how it was caused. I will leave it at that. I did enjoy most of the plot but there are some questionable directing moments. For example, How the hell did Kallen and Suzaku not recognize Lelouch’s voice when Lelouch assumes his secret identity? What I enjoyed greatly was the tactics that were shown in this series. I don’t want to give away much but I will say Code Geass was an engaging series, it was worth my time, and I do recommend checking this out if you have been living under a rock because this is one of the animes that still gets talked about today. However, I got more Code Geass to talk about but it will have to be said in my review of Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2.\nCode Geass was available by Bandai Entertainment, it went out of print till it got rescued by Funimation. They have not re-released Code Geass at this time but I am hopeful for not only a re-release, but a Blu-ray release would be nice too. Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2 is also available in the same situation that the first season is under. The two OVA “Special Editions” were never licensed and trust me, they are condensed versions of the two seasons. The Code Geass light novels were available by Bandai Visual and my guess is that they are out of print. The Code Geass video game “Lost Colors” for the PS2 and PSP never made it out of Japan. The light novel “Red Tracks” was never released outside Japan as well. The Code Geass R2 light novels never gotten an English release, The Code Geass Manga as well as other mangas called “Suzaku of the Counterattack” and “Nightmare of Nunnally” were available by Bandai Entertainment but are now out of print. Two mangas called “Tales of an Alternate Shogunate”, “Renya of Darkness” and “Oz The Reflection” were never released outside Japan. An OVA called “Nunnally in Wonderland” was also never licensed. The OVA series “Code Geass: Akito the Exiled” has been picked up by Funimation, and the manga “Oz the Reflection O2” has not been licensed.\n\nCode Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion is an anime with good animation, unique character designs, a nice soundtrack, some standout characters, and a plot that could have had some points directed better. In the long run, I really enjoyed this series (flaws and all) and I did view it as an excellent series and the end of this season did make me want to watch its second season immediately. It also has a good cast on both the Japanese version and the English Dub. You can’t go wrong with either version. Give this series a try if you haven’t seen it after all these years.\n\nI give Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion a 9 out of 10.\nI hereby command you…to leave a comment if you wish.\n        "},

It's pretty crazy at times, there's a little campiness here and there, and it is definitely hilarious. The hilarity is magnified by the fabulous characters like Lelouch.\nIt experiences a few of the same mood swings that Valvrave has. There several times in the series where the episodes will be absolutely mind-screwing crazy and slowly rip you to pieces. The plot goes along with this by being pretty insane and over-the-top on more than one occasion. It is mostly covered for by the overt awesomeness that the series exhibits though.\nThe main character is a complete aversion of the usual hero character because he exhibits far more traits of an anti-hero. This was an entertaining exploitation of this plot device because his jerkness completely blindsides you sometimes. It mixed up the formula and I liked it.\nThis is good for someone looking for a series that bleeds craziness and awesomeness into a mecha show at the same time. This means that if you liked Valvrave the Liberator, you'll probably like this. It digs a bit deeper than Valvrave and the ending is better. Generally speaking, everything in Code Geass comes across more seriously (but more flamboyantly) than it did in Valvrave.\n        "},
			{["score"]=5, ["helpful"]=15, ["text"]="                          \n    *MINOR SPOILERS WITHIN*\nI'm not really sure why Code Geass is so positively rated. There are definitely some good parts, however the show has so many pitfalls that they completely cancel out any good qualities. The first thing that I really didn't like about it was the plot structure. Many people compare this show to Death Note, and side by side, Code Geass absolutely pales in comparison. On average each individual episode did very little to forward Lelouch's goal of taking down the Brittanian Empire. The majority of the episodes felt either like filler, or they would follow a predictable formula like this: Lelouch plans something\n          \n        sneaky, he totally destroys the empire's forces, then right as they are about to win Suzeku rolls in and undoes absolutely everything. Seriously, this happens over and over for the entire first season. Then in the middle of the season Mao shows up, with absolutely no explanation and starts causing Lelouch to do an even more pitiful job then he is already doing of forwarding the rebellion. The season finale was absolute rubbish as well. It did nothing at all to conclude the plot of the first season and left such an inordinate number of cliffhangers that it just felt like a cheap gimmick to trick you into watching the second season. After the first four or five episodes out of twenty five in R1, it felt like nothing significant to the plot really happened at all besides minor character development.\nBesides the plot, I really hated the fan-service in this anime as well. Any show that has to rely on huge boobs or pantie shots to garner the attention of the audience is not one worth watching. There were two nude scenes with Kallen, one where Euphemia takes off her clothes for literally no reason, and a scene where Nina is straight up masturbating to pictures of Euphemia. All these scenes did very little if anything to add to the plot, and in some cases detracted from it. \nCode Geass does have very good action and does a great job of creating suspense. I admit that when I watched this show it had me hooked for the first season. In retrospect however, there are just so many problems with what could have been an absolutely amazing anime that it completely counters everything that this show does well.\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=15, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I was going to bring one season of anime to watch on my iPod on my vacation, and I chose Code Geass. Boy, did I make the right choice.\nFor those of you who know Death Note, you can consider Code Geass the same except less based around tactics and more based around character development. Also, Code Geass has a much brighter, lighter feel to it, wheras Death Note feels very dark most of the time. That said, I'll break this down for ya:\nSTORY: 8/10\nBasically, Lelouch the main character is a 17 year old boy who has always disliked the Brittanian empire that conquered Japan long\n          \n        ago, naming it 'Area 11'. As such, native Japanese people were nicknamed 'Elevens' by the Brittanians, who discriminated and continue to oppress the Japanese. Lelouch finally gets what he needs to get started, and begins to rebel against Brittania. \nNot horribly inventive, but still engaging. What I love about the story personally is  that it seems like no character was forced to do something to steer the plot in the desired directions. Every character does what he/she feels, and the plot develops itself. Very natural feeling. Also no fillers (w00t!)\nART: 9/10\nThe art is great; love the eye styles (I'm big on eyestyles, in case you didn't know) and the character designs are unique and refresing. There is a bit of recycled panoramas, but I usually dont have a problem with that; it doesnt really negatively affect the anime.\nSOUND: 9/10\nThe OPs/EDs are fantastic, with songs by Access and FLOW (my favs) and they REALLY made me love the music. As for the in-anime sound effects, nothing really struck me as astounding, but the sound in general is very good (Very good is an 8/10... oh well, the OPs and EDs are too good)\nCHARACTER: 10/10\nThe reason I have a 10 in this section is because there is a character (or more) for everyone to love. Like Death Note, Code Geass becomes a battle of morals, and every character has a different opinion on what should happen. Unique designs, great voice acting, very memorable characters.\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\nThe plot always keeps you engaged. I love the fact that you dont always know what is going to happen next, so it keeps you on the edge of your seat. No huge flashback episodes either (which I personally hate; wasting a whole episode for a flashback is like a filler to me...). You'll root for certain characters, laugh, maybe cry? Who knows, its a whole different experience for me.\nOVERALL: 10/10\nAll of these elements slapped together make a very memorable anime that I will remember for a while. The sequel to this season is great as well, be sure to check that out. Hard for me to say anymore; go give this one a watch!\n        "},
			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=15, ["text"]="\n                          \n    I'm not going to go to much in depth but I'm just going to give you my overall thoughts on the series.\nWhen I saw this when I was younger, I thought this was the greatest and most flawless Anime ever. Fast forward a few years, and honestly? It's still in my top 10. This Anime is flawed heavily in so many aspects, there is pretty much ass pulls and plot holes every episode or two. Lelouch is pretty much given an power that allows poor writing since it's beyond broken, he pulls deus ex machina constantly. There is shameless fan service, it tries to have\n          \n        too much of a wide audience appeal through too many genres. Characters have such over exaggerated personality's it felt like a self parody at times. It adds in Mechas for the sake of adding Mechas, and it's over the top in every aspect.\nBut you know what? At the end of the day none of those flaws mattered in my enjoyment in the series. The series was such a blast to watch that it reminds me that Anime should be about one thing, and that is having fun. Would Code Geass by better if it had better writing, and cut down on a lot of those aspects that majority of people think ruins the show? Probably, but then again it won't be Code Geass. I know that seems like a stupid answer but those flaws are what makes Code Geass, well Code Geass. I could rant on for hours about the shows flaws but in all honesty I was having way too much fun. I love the overblown character personality, I love how Lelouch somehow outsmarts everybody even in ways that don't make sense. I love the ass shots of Kallen every time she appears on screen. And above all else, I love how insane and over the top series is.\nThe show isn't for everybody though, if you get annoyed by amount of plot holes it has at times and the poor writing. I don't suggest it, but if you can turn off your brain and just enjoy the show for what it is, you will have a hell of a time.\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5, ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    At this point in time, we can say that Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion has become one of the most unforgettable anime of all time to many anime fans. To be honest, I was quite skeptical watching it first and asked questions like “Is this any good” or “Can I enjoy this from its story?” \nAs usual, being an anime, it sparks many different opinions. Is it good or bad? Is it somehow relative to the real life? Or just plain b*******?\nAnd I decided to go along with the bandwagons the public says about this series. And guess what I found? A masterpiece with\n          \n        a great story, lots of theatrics, equipped with a cliffhanger at the finale. (That’s why it has a second season)\nMind Games. An exiled prince. An impending rebellion. If we look at it carefully, we can somehow predict what will happen if we dive deeper in the series. Lelouch Lamperouge, the main character of the series, is a student in Ashford Academy, which is located in Area 11, which is Japan before it was conquered by Britannia, a kingdom that controls 1/3 of the whole world. He is smart, but chooses to cut classes and instead, have chess with nobles whom he easily beats without a sweat. He also has a younger sister named Nunally Lamperouge.\nSeems ordinary, right? Can a high school student lead a rebellion? (Like the title says) Until a revelation that he is actually an exiled prince from Britannia, and holds a grudge with its emperor, Charles zi Britannia to the point that he actually plans to destroy it in a future date. \nThen he meets a girl named C.C., a mysterious girl who was unfortunately shot point-blank to a vital organ, enough to kill her. But before she collapsed, she bestowed Lelouch the power called Geass, the power to bind anyone to follow his will. That caused him to start his rebellion, lead a double life and create a very influential figure named Zero.\nIts story mainly focuses on the drama from the various victims of various onslaughts, and the strategies perpetuated by Lelouch as Zero and the Black Knights while maintaining his mask as a student with a story which makes viewers very eager to watch the next episode until they finish it. Each episode seems to end with a cliffhanger, all the more reason to continue watching it.\nIt also kind of focuses on best friend relationships slash ultimate rivals, which is kind of unique in its own way, making the story more interesting.\nThe art utilized in the series was great, concerning the character design, the Geass activation scenes, and the epic battle scenes between the protagonists and the antagonists in mecha armors, which reminds me about the Gundam Series. The KnightMares, however, is also unique in its own way including the L******t, the G***n ** II, and the G****n. I also commend the arts made in the advanced technologies both sides have (like the A****n and I*****a), and especially, Zero and his costume, which seems to have left a big mark in the anime world today.\nAlso, the art made by CLAMP (usually people with elongated bodies) were fantastic. It is utilized perfectly along with those various poses of Lelouch and others.  Need I say more?\nConcerning the sounds, OST’s and the theme songs, I found them to be highly appreciable, especially the songs by FLOW and Ali Project (My little brother kind of hates “Yuukyou Seishunka”). The background music also blends well with the events in the story, especially those head tone voices that can be heard in some serious points in the series.\nAbout the characters, I really liked the main character Lelouch Lamperouge. Once again, he is smart, handsome, and his voice actor is one of my most favorite voice actors ever, although his physique is kind of weak. How about C.C, Suzaku, Kallen, and the others? They all strike different fancies in me as they have different personalities, different backgrounds, different stories, but who knows? Many hate Suzaku, but I like him. Maybe because I’m me and they’re them? He has a unique past, and unique moves, albeit impossible to perform. Now let us end this character review before I say any more bandwagons.\nUtter Enjoyment.\nI really enjoyed watching Code Geass. NO more, no less. I kept asking to myself: “What will happen next?” or “Will they win?”, and some other more questions that really heightened my expectations about what I can see in this series.\nOverall, I commend Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion as it is a masterpiece to me. A perfect epitome of anime with countless battles, strategies, suspense, and mind games situated within. Kudos.\nBefore I forget, the subplots in the anime sometimes had comedic routines which I found very easy to laugh at. But interestingly enough, they are somehow connected to the plot, if you analyze it enough."},

After watching the first episode I was really amazed that what happened.  It's very much like death note + gundam seed because It fallows a same goal as death note.  Why gundam seed some people ask?.  As I said before this anime is like death note + gundam seed.  There are robots/mechs like in seed but they don't\n          \n        really look too detailed until suzuka got his new knightmare (gundam/robot/mech thingy).

Well it's not really a downside but most the characters In code geass never really changes cloths much and always wear the same thing.  \nI am looking forward for season 2 and I bet you are if you start watching CODE GEASS.

			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=14, ["text"]="\n                          \n    Story-9/10\nLelouch- ‘’To defeat evil, I shall become an even greater evil!’’\nI will say at this point. Code Geass does what it says on the tin. It is over the top, plot twists are incomprehensible and cliché themes are used throughout. Watching Code Geass and complaining about the lack of beauty or realism makes as much sense as buying a solar powered flashlight. Code Geass is there for the entertainment, so bear that in mind… Now to the review. \nCode Geass certainly knows how to carry out such a grand and theatrical story. The overall conflict takes place on planet earth as we know it, with\n          \n        slight changes in world history. World politics and moral stances, although extreme, are thus all too familiar, and the viewer is therefore easily able to grasp the sheer scale and severity of the actions and moral dilemmas in the anime. The story itself is straight forward. Code Geass knows where it wants to go, and how to get there. As a result, every episode (even with the supposed filler episodes) will conclude and offer relevant advancements in the story. The sheer pace and scale of the show makes watching Code Geass an exciting and dramatic experience. \nCode Geass does well to set the stage for its succeeding TV series. The grey themes in Code Geass are taken very seriously, and for the viewer to fully appreciate the different views, care must be taken when presenting them. Code Geass does take it’s time to make sure you understand the different characters’ perspectives and political situation the world finds itself in. Once the stage is set, the show really does take off and the scale and general epicenes of everything gradually and successfully builds, leading the way to the second series. \nThe moral dilemmas are well argued in the anime. The universe of Code Geass creates the ideal setting for the controversial and applicable issues to be presented. Each viewpoint surfaces through sound reasoning, is enhanced through personal experience and is pushed to the limits through vigorous testing of one’s will. The level battlefield between the arguments results in the viewer being constantly thrown around by powerful/ logical viewpoints and flawed outcomes. While characters themselves may not be overly consistent or powerful in presenting their own personal ideas, they all contribute to make sure the two, main overarching ideas are at the forefront and are in constant conflict. \nArt-8/10\nLet’s be honest, a Code Geass wallpaper does look like the local circus is hosting a Yu-Gi-Oh themed wrestling match. Do not be put off by this. Code Geass has the potential to be a very dark anime but its clear aim of simply providing entertainment lends itself to this style of animation. The colours used are striking and add to the theatrical feel of the anime and the almost crude representation of the human body makes Code Geass feel like more of a play (rather than a realistic portrayal that we could relate to, which of course, Code Geass could never be). The battle scenes and environments are full of detail and action. Character design and the design of the universe in general maintains the theatrical and striking style of Code Geass.\nSound- 8/10\nThe soundtrack further emphasises this feeling of experiencing a show. When you are watching a play in a theatre, you are aware of the stage and the audience; the soundtrack thus aims to make you aware that you are watching an epic piece of drama. It never tries to help you affiliate with characters through using unique character OSTs or encourage you to become emotionally entwined with relationships by using overly beautiful soundtracks. It simply wants you to sit back and enjoy all of these individual aspects as part of the overall performance and it does this by using the same, theatrical language throughout most of the OSTs. Otherwise, voice acting in subbed is fantastic, certain characters in dubbed lack gravitas, but on the whole is successful. Here are some soundtracks that best represent the universe of Code Geass; ‘’Britannian National Anthem’’, ‘’Stories’’ and ‘’0’’. \nCharacters- 10/10\nLelouch- ‘’The trick of real combat is that everyone is human.’’\n\nCode Geass has a legendary array of characters. The anime finds itself having to balance moral arguments, military bodies, different main characters and the weaker, entertainment driven supporting cast. Code Geass makes sure that each group/ individual can be respected and understood and does this by providing constant and gradual development. How the groups interact within themselves and how each organisation views other organisations are also well explored. The result of this even and constant development between all persons results in one of the largest cast of characters from anime that can all be understood and respected. \nNo matter their façade in battle, every character is undoubtedly a human. What was so great to see was that every character sets of with a steadfast commitment to their personal beliefs, but are constantly and vigorously tested to the point where they can no longer walk with such pride. Lelouch, the main, and supposedly most resolute character ends up having his will tested the most and seeing a self-proclaimed king succumb to these tests delivers the arguments presented in Code Geass with absolute force. Having such authentic characters in an otherwise completely over the top anime enables the viewer to take the very controversial themes present in Code Geass that much more seriously.  \nEnjoyment- 9/10\nCode Geass is one hell of a thrill ride. Absolutely everything about Code Geass is done with the aim of the viewer’s entertainment. The battle scenes offer intense stand offs between military geniuses, epic single conflicts and stunning visuals. Characters offer comedy, romance and drama into the mix. The story itself has an epic sense of scale to it. The only factor holding this section back is that Code Geass purposefully uses this first season to build up to the second season, and thus has placed some deliberate  shackles on the extent it is willing to go. But putting shackles on a dragon ain’t gonna stop it flying or breathing fire! \nOverall-9/10\nCode Geass is built for entertainment. It knows this, it uses everything in its power to emphasise this. Please look at Code Geass as a piece of entertainment, rather than some artistic masterpiece.  I thoroughly recommend for you to watch Code Geass, and sincerely hope you will have as great a time as I did. "},

This series is about Lelouch vi Britannia who lives under his alias Lelouch Lamperouge, the name taken from his mother. When he was 10 years old his mother died while his sister Nunnally became paralyzed from being shot in both legs and also became blinded. Lelouch was angry at his father and King of Britannia, Charles, over this incident and threatened to renounce his entitlement to the throne. Unexpectedly his father already had plans to send him and his sister to Japan so they\n          \n        could be used as political hostages. While there they stayed with the Prime Minister's family, the Kururugi's, where he met Suzaku who became his best friend, even though they never got along at first. After the Britannian Empire created Knightmare Frames (fighting robots/ mechs), they quickly took over Japan, leaving Lelouch and his sister without a place to go until they were taken in by the Ashford family and given a room at their academy. \nCharles view of the world is stern; there are winners and losers, the rich and poor, and those at the bottom will never succeed. Lelouch swore after everything that happened, he would make a fair world so his sister could have a chance as well as find out about his mother's death. But to do this he would need power, authority, money, a team, and a way for no one to recognize him. He thought he would need to wait a long time for all of this to come together, but then he meets a mysterious girl named C.C. who makes a contract with him in order for her to get one wish and Lelouch to get a geass. The geass is an eye power that is different for every user. Lelouch can use his geass to control anybody with a gaze in their eyes, but can only use it once per person. After receiving the Geass he leads a group of rebels through radio into defeating Clovis. After this he dons his new outfit and mask to become Zero, the knight of justice.\nArt 9/10:\nYou would think an action series would use a shonen style, but on the contrary, it uses CLAMPS's, a shoujo style wich surprisingly goes well with the series. Its refreshing to see this rather than the same old shonen style.\nSound 7/10:\nIn my opinion the OST's were average, not great but not bad wither. As for the openings and endings, well, they just weren't my type of music.\nCharacters 10/10:\nCode Geass has a wide variety of characters ato like, and well, dislike. But in this review I will focus on the 4 main characters:\nLelouch vi Britannia is an extremely intellegent high school student who doesn't take his studies or his postion of Vice-President on the Student Council too seriously. He is calm, sophisticated, and arrogant due to his upbrining. Even so he is righteous and noble by nature he has a belief that he must commit evil to destroy an even greater evil. At first his goals are a bit selfish but, he comes to realize that his goal can become good for the entire world. He also has a habit of blaming everything on himself, whether or not he is at fault. And though he can be merciless on the battlefield, he truly cares for his friends at school and his comrades on the battlefield. \nSuzaku Kururugi wants to change Britannia just like Lelouch, but believes violence will not solve anything. He is naieve belief that Britannia can be changed for the better. This huge difference of beliefs between him and Lelouch eventually leads them to become rivals. Then mortal enemies after Zero kills Suzaku's love in which he loses some of his naivety and no longer believe that killing will no longer solve anything. Since he wants nothing more than Zero dead.\nC.C. is a mysterious girl who can grant the powers of the Geass among anyone who she deems fit. She is quite cold and emotionless, but over time begins to care about Lelouch more than just someone she wants to use to get her wish.\nKallen Stadtfeld/Kozuki is a half Britannian on her father's side and a Japanese on her mother's. She also has a low temper, is very stong willed and sometimes impulsive. Despite all of this she is sensitive and gentle. She can come off to people at first as cold and ruthless, but cares deeply for her teammates and especially for Zero which grows as the series goes on. \nEnjoyment 10/10:\nAt first I thought I wouldn't like this series because I hate mech series, but soon came to realize that this story has a deep plot with many twists that you can just not stop watching. \nOverall 10/10:\nI would reccommend this series to anyone 14+ because it does have violence and blood as well as dark themes. As for genre, don't worry what type of series you are into because I promise you that this is a series  anybody would enjoy.\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7, ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Code Geass is easily my favorite show. The story is outstanding, the characters are phenomenal, and the sound track is amazing. In addition, this show has one of the strongest pilots I have ever watched. \nThe pilot episode establishes Lelouch's (main character) character perfectly, and in one short entertaining scene. It wastes no time getting the viewer straight into the plot of the show, while establishing the hierarchy of characters. \nThe reason I absolutely loved this show stems from the fact that I enjoy the mind games involved. As a quick comparison, for those of you who have watched Death Note or Guilty Crown, Death\n          \n        Note has extremely similar strong characters, while Guilty Crown has an extremely intriguing story almost as though copied and modified from Code Geass. I'd go as far as to say that if you combine Death Note and Guilty Crown, you create Code Geass.\nThe soundtrack. Every single opening and ending is amazing. The opening gets you hyped for the episode perfectly, while the endings almost grieve the end of the episode. I cannot praise the soundtrack enough. \nI have no opinion on the art because I personally don't care about it. \nNow that I've gone through the pros, lets address some issues that I noticed with the show. The show has a few ex machina moments which take you out of the show. They aren't too prevalent, but they do occur. Additionally the show is slow to introduce a true rival to Lelouch. Honestly those are the only points I was unhappy with, which is why the show still rates a perfect 10 for me.\nOverall, throughout 49 episodes, there was no point where I was bored of the show on my first time watching it. Every episode brought something new and exciting, and the ones that didn't were well times to allow you to come to terms with the events of the previous episode. The progression of the story is done well, with no pointless filler in a 49 episode long show. \n        "},

After watching Death Note I was un-satisfied with the ending ( it is still one of my favorite anime series of all time) but I wanted a show that had a brilliant ending and that's where Code Geass comes in which has what I consider to be one of the greatest anime endings off all time and anime series of all time. There is nothing to fault in this show, its image is squeaky clean. Everything from the characters, story, art, enjoyment and overall experience was perfect. I have just one tiny problem\n          \n        with it and that is it's fan service, I don't think that was needed in this anime and since I'm a girl that was a bit uncomfortable to watch at times other than that this show is a MASTERPIECE.

			{["score"]=1, ["helpful"]=4, ["text"]="                          \n    Credit where credit is due, this show has one really great OP. And that's it, that's literally all the credit I'm willing to give, I hate literally everything else.\nLet's go ahead and start with my biggest complaint that makes itself evident in the first 5 minutes of the show; this show has the single most insulting writing for a \"smart\" main character I have ever seen. The main character of Lelouch is introduced to us by telling, not showing, us he wins a supposedly unwinnable game of chess, intercut with a completely useless and unnecessary scene of a girl changing into a swimsuit doting over\n          \n        how smart he is when he isn't even there. Despite being at maximum hype levels after the OP, I was ready to drop this show 5 minutes in, but I kept watching because of how popular and beloved this show is. Needless to say, I regret that decision, the entire show works on the same weak logic, lazy story telling, and horrid character writing.\nMy hatred of Lelouch only grew though, peaking after what happens with Shirley. I can't say what it was he did without a pretty major spoiler, but he had so many options available to him, and he chooses possibly the most stupid option possible. Then the show insults me by trying to treat it as a sad moment despite it being entirely his own fault.\nAs much as I dislike Lelouch though, he might genuinely be the best character in the show. If I broke down every single character and why I hated them, I'd be here forever, but they're all completely one dimensional and fall into 3 basic categories; useless, senseless, and manipulative. Most of the useless characters are girls that could easily be written out of the story, but they wanted to keep in sexual themes and dumb highschool drama, the worst example being the girl who had sex with a table (yes you read that right and it's actually dumber than it sounds). Every character in the show lacks logical consistency, but several are completely defined by their senselessness such as Suzaku who tries to explain his thought process multiple times and somehow it becomes more self contradictory every single time to the point where he becomes nothing more than a nonsensical plot point to create drama. The worst of the worst however are characters like Shirley and Nunnally who just scream \"PITY ME!!!\" by having as tragic stories as possible and literally nothing else to their characters.\nI can't believe I made it this far without even mentioning the many many plot conveniences. I can't get into specifics without spoiling everything, but this show requires absolutely massive amounts of suspension of disbelief, I've heard the things that make the climax happen described as \"the worst writing of all time,\" and while that's obviously hyperbole, the sentiment is right. This is the part of the show most people who dislike it point to as to why they dislike it, but honestly, by the time I got to that point, I didn't even care and it almost got into \"so bad it's good\" territory. It didn't though, it's still pathetic and an insult to my intelligence because they once again try to make me feel remorse for circumstances that were entirely avoidable if not for how stupid every single character was.\nActually, let me harp on those unearned emotional moments for a bit. One of them I can harp about isn't even a spoiler, during the first episode, two characters heavily featured in promotional material and the OP get shot and appear to be dead, Lelouch even says so himself. They're both just fine, it was a complete misdirect for the purpose of drama. Every single time the show tries to have a moment, there is something that makes it stupid instead of sad, and by the halfway point, I was just pissed off. No other show I've seen has ever managed to screw up basic writing like this one has.\nI can't end the review without at least addressing the presentation, which was easily the best part of the show. The character designs were pretty solid actually, and the music definitely had its moments, but overall I found the show just boring to watch with extremely limited animation at times where the only movement was moving lips or panning over still shots of mechs with bullet effects, with the budget obviously going to animating the actions of unique mechs, but even those weren't anything great, rarely having more than a couple frames for an individual action, so it left me underwhelmed. At first I felt bad judging a show because it was made over a decade ago, but after doing a little bit of research, I learned this show came out around the same time as Gurren Lagann and actually came out after Eureka Seven. Those shows might have been done by better studios, but that doesn't change the fact that they are so much more interesting to look, you can feel the creativity in all of the key shots while Code Geass feels minimalistic at all times.\nHonestly, I'm only scratching the surface of all the things I dislike, but I want to put this show behind me. It's garbage, the worst thing I've ever even tried to watch and I can't believe I made myself sit through it.\n        "},

Bad mech fights\n-Second Opening theme is so bad.\n-Suzaku's character is bad.\nI am re-reviewing this anime because my review before is too bias.\nCode Geass is the very first short anime that I've ever finish and this was the anime that entered me to the world of anime. I was amazed at first of course but after watching many anime, this anime has major flaws ALTHOUGH, this anime is STILL amazing.\nThe story is about a boy named Lelouch \"Lamperogue\" (Not his real last name). After his\n          \n        Mother's death and the disability of his sister, he wants to take revenge on the Britannian Empire. He also wishes for peace like his sister wish for. However, he doesn't have the power to do that until one day, C.C. grants him the power of Geass. He also disguised himself as Zero and fight against the Britannian Empire. This is where the thrill of the anime kicks in.\nWhat I like about this anime is that it doesn't know when to stop. Every episode, there's always a thrill that kicks in which is a huge plus. Though, it does suffer from fillers (Just the half of the one episode). However, the last episode of Season 1 ended as a bad cliffhanger which was a big disappointment.\nI am not really a big fan of it's art style. I don't really like the style where almost all characters are very tall. Also, the battle between Mechs isn't even that entertaining. Not just that but, the animation between 2 openings are almost the same. They recycled it. The only difference is their theme song. Though, this anime doesn't really suffer from a lot of still frames so that's a plus there.\nThe OST on this anime is great. The orchestrated music used on the thrilling moments fits the show very well. The first opening theme was also great until the second opening theme came. The second opening theme is one of the most annoying opening themes in anime history. \"YOU MAAAAAD?!?!\" - no. Just shut the f*ck up. Though, the third opening theme is, alright.\nFor the characters, I'll go with Lelouch Lamperogue first. This guy is a natural genius similar to Light Yagami from Death Note. Actually both of them share very similar traits except Lelouch can be really soft at times. Lelouch likes to win against the Britannian Empire and he deduces his situations very well.\nThe \"best friend\" of Lelouch - Kururugi Suzaku. Nope, I am not convinced that they're best friends. Suzaku really has a bland character. His decisions can be too stupid at times. Too avoid spoilers, let's just say, there are some actions of his that he should have done in the first place if he knew in the first place. Yeah, just watch the anime if you want to know.\nC.C. is a girl who granted the power of Geass to Lelouch. She's somewhat a Kuudere. She can be loving at times but, she also has this cold and sarcastic personality towards Lelouch. Comparing her to Ryuk from Death Note, she does help Lelouch and supports him to win.\nKallen Stadtfeld is half Japanese, half Britannian. She is a terrorist and she eventually joined the Black Knights. She has a depressing back story which lead her joining the terrorist. She is somewhat the \"badass girl\" of the anime because of her rough behavior.\nEvery characters are entertaining on this anime though, I guess I am really bothered with Suzaku's character.\nOverall, I enjoyed the anime's thrill but when the thrill doesn't stop until the end of it's season, that's a bad thing. Is this anime worth watching? Even though it's not your genre, yes it is. This anime is not boring because it always has it's \"WTF!\" Moments and it doesn't know when to stop.\nScore: 8/10\n        "},

The Holy Empire of Britannia began a campaign to conquer the whole world, and the first to fall was of course Japan. Thanks to a new weapon, called the Knightmare Frames, the Holy Britannia was able to dictate its will. Now the Land of the Rising Sun is nothing but a colony declared as Area 11. The EU, as well as China, are at the verge of extermination and the hope is lost. However, an unknown person appears becoming the last hope of the oppressed. Alas, it is still unclear if he will truly become the Messiah or the devil\n          \n        himself. How will that mysterious person change the feature? Find out about it right now! \n-Story-\nCode Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion) tells a story about a student, Lelouch Lamperouge, who has his reasons to pay his homeland back. To fulfill the plan our hero will need a super power, or a technology giving him the needed superiority. By a pure fluke, Lelouch encounters a woman granting him that power. But even with that special power it would be simply unreal to fight against the whole empire alone! That is where Lelouch remembers about the dying Japan helping a group of separatists trying to create a better future for their land. This group of separatists has neither an army nor a leader, and it seems that that group of people is simply useless. Thankfully, everything is not that easy. Lelouch becomes the leader of this group, little by little strengthening it and revealing his true aim. \nWhile this concept may sound not promising for one, Code Geass is able to prove its superiority in every possible aspect. The first season doesn’t leave unanswered questions; it gives shrewd reasoning explaining every problem you are interested in. I didn’t find any captious objections to the story-line; it is simply great.\nOne may think that an anime about robots is senseless and should be avoided at any cost. Indeed, but CG doesn’t have that mecha feel as the most mecha anime do. It is not a Gundam, it is an anime about Lelouch’s rebellion. On top of that, Britania has conquered almost the whole world thanks to that technology and it made it important for the story-line.\n-Animation-\nThanks to the CLAMP ladies the anime is catching for both males and females. Even in spite of the fact that this anime is pretty old, there is charm in it, and you will surely appreciate it. The action scenes are also well done. \n***Note: Clamp is an all-female Japanese manga artist group that was formed in the mid-1980.***\n-Sound-\nThis show has, indeed, a weird set of the main themes. The first opening simply doesn’t suit this anime; it is an anime about aristocracy, war, intrigues and this opening is simply a bad idea. And after hearing such themes as: Yuukyou Seishunka by Ali Project and Innocent Days by Hitomi, you understand that incongruity of the themes even more. But it doesn’t matter. What matters is that this anime has some god-like tracks, which will make you feel like you are in the heaven. It is very difficult to describe that beauty of the soundtrack, but this anime has one of the best music tracks you will ever find in your life. \n-Characters-\nCode Geass (s1) doesn’t have any noticeable flaws, but when it comes to the characters, the whole picture changes dramatically. The title of this anime makes it clear that this anime is about Lelouch and Lelouch only. So, it is pretty obvious that he will take all the screen-time. On top of that, taking into account the number of characters, it would be impossible to give them all the same development.\nLamperouge Lelouch is the only figure, which makes this anime that amazing. He is like Yagami Light to Death Note, but the difference is their nature. Yagami Light’s hard-hearted nature can’t make him a remembering character. Without a doubt, he is a remarkable hero to mention, but this lack of feelings was a big problem. Lelouch, however, is more humane. Both Yagami Light and Lamperouge Lelouch are students, geniuses, have masterminds;yet, that difference in their nature makes the difference between their characters definitely obvious. It is an open secret, that we all watch anime for emotions and seeing an emotionless protagonist wouldn’t be a good thing. Thankfully, Code Geass offers us a hero, who loves his sister (No, he doesn’t have a little sister complex, his attachment is a bit different), has a girlfriend and has an old-friend he cares about. He is both a hero and an anti-hero, but don’t think about it now. You will have to think about it a little bit later. \nThe supporting cast is the real problem of Code Geass. For example take Suzaku. This person doesn’t make sense at all. Sometimes he tries to make us think that what he did is a good thing;yet, sometimes he shows that uncertainty about his deeds. The rest of the supporting cast has also some problems, but nothing major to mention. \nDon’t be upset about the supporting cast. It is not a Code Geass: Hangyaku no Suzuku, it is Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch. And the supporting cast isn’t that bad to avoid this anime.\n-Enjoyment-\nThe good: \n1)It is realistic. It doesn’t leave you a feeling that some random people found some stuff on Wikipedia and made a show about it. \n2)The music is simply brilliant. \n3)The story-line is well-written, which makes it enjoyable to watch this show.\n4)The main character.\nThe bad:\n1)Supporting cast. \nOverall (9,5=~10/10)\nOverall, Code Geass is one of these anime, which will be appealing for both males and females. However, I wouldn’t recommend this show for kids. (Drugs, deaths (following one after another, mild fan service and other unpleasant things.))\nAre you still unconscious after seeing Death Note? Do you want to see the continuation, which may become your new favorite? Haven’t you seen Code Geass yet? What are you waiting for?\n        "},

Sure, people go insane over Lelouch, but he's an over rated character, and simply isn't as awesome as Light.  \nIn fact, he's a pathetic wimp, and is not very intelligent at all.  He's the only real character that the anime goes into depth about, but then again that isn't saying much, because the story simply lacks\n          \n        character analysis.\nThe plot was intriguing.  The use of ridiculous plot twists gets over done pretty quickly.  Plot twists are good, as long as they're believable and not dim-witted to an extreme.  There's no aspect of \"mystery\" and \"I want to watch more of this\" anywhere in the show, unlike Evangelion or Death Note.  \nEven though Evangelion was a character-based show, at least the concept of Angels and Nerv kept the watcher interested enough to keep viewing.  However, in Code Geass, there wasn't anything that made me want to keep on watching it, besides Lelouch's shitty past.  \nAll of the characters are all stereotypes, and never is the told anything interesting about them before they all die.  There were way too many characters in this story, first of all.  Also, unlike Light, Lelouch is a pathetic attempt at an anti-hero. \nI know I compare a lot of this to Death Note, because the anime takes much of the aspects of Death Note and makes them a lot worse.\n        "},

'Twist-happy' is a phrase that springs to mind, unfortunately almost every single one of those twists fails at what they're meant to do. They don't excite, intrigue or surprise the watcher, they don't often add new and interesting elements to the story and they are completely predictable.\nYet Lelouch's adventure is still an enjoyable ride, the art is fantastic and the use of action and mind games is spot on.\nThough none of the characters really hit home on the emotional front, they\n          \n        combine to make a strong, though once again stereotypical, cast. The most interesting part of Code Geass for me is the very personal chess game going on between Lelouch and his enemies. Unfortunately, this element is lost amidst the large scale of the conflicts, instead of being a personal battle of wills it descends into a much more diluted affair.\nThis 'intellectual' character has certainly become popular since Death Note, yet many creators are forgetting what made the battle between Light and L so brilliant.\nGood but not great, take it as its own entity and that is exactly what you will get.\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=13, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    This series is my current fav by far.\nStory: Too many people compare this series to Death Note.  The only similarities is that the main character is a teenage prodigy who's willing to use any means, including supernatural, necessary to achieve their goals.  The similarities end about there.\nAs a slight explanation, Geass is the ability that Lelouch has to force anyone to obey his commands by looking them in the eye.  The moral questions of this ability are never really explored but let your mind wander for 5 minutes on what you would do with it and I bet at the end of\n          \n        that 5 minutes you will have thought of at least of 3 crimes with 20 year minimum sentences.\nThis series, and the sequel series, seems to mock the standard mecha anime formulas and metaphors.  The mecha only serve as a vehicle to allow the characters to fight without destroying each other.\nThis is made clearer by the fact that despite a massive war and frighteningly powerful weaponry, only one major character is killed in the entire first series.\nAnyone who's ever played a 'god-sim' (ie Civilization) will recognize Lelouch's chidish attitude towards his war with Britannia at the beginning.  As time goes on, he matures but also continues to lose his innocence as he uses increasingly immoral means to meet his goals.  Suzaku, the almost stereotypical white knight, acts as his foil exemplifying traditional attributes of heroes; physical ability, honest nature, comradery.  I don't have much to talk about with the story since this series is almost completely character-driven.\nArt: Nothing special, though all the characters are memorable and interesting.  Lelouch is a very flexible character who they can make look heroic, apathetic, and downright sinister. The mecha are nothing fantastic though the choreography of the battles is very well done.\nSound: I enjoyed the opening and closing credits of most of the episodes.  Nothing I want to add to my mp3 playlist, but they work.\nCharacter:  Lelouch's character is amazingly complex as he goes from a child wishing to avenge his mother to a man who begins to realize the importance of his actions.  In the end, he returns to his childish ways at the end of this series and he and his comrades pay the price of his actions.  Things turn around in R2, but that's a different review.  Suzaku's development is very little in this series.  Of course that makes his changes in R2 that much more fascinating, but in this one he's a very static character.  In the end he suffers for Lelouch's actions and puts into motion Lelouch's own suffering.\nThe side characters are largely boring.  I hated Mina, the bookworm closet lesbian racist, but then I expect that was the intent.  His school friends become an unnecessary bore and are anime school chum stereotypes.  Karen, pronounced and mispelled at times as Kallen, was a good character with clear motivation and background.  I feel as though her plotline(s) are neglected in both series.  C.C. (pronounced C2) is very boring.  Her droll manner is punctuated by brief moments of emotion toward Lelouch which are meant to be meaningful but largely fall flat.   By far C.C. is the most interesting character, but is never very engaging and is largely used to promote the show's primary sponsor, Pizza Hut. \nOverall: The mind-twist of this series is that you find yourself rooting for a person who is willing to destroy the world in a quest for revenge and the dim hope of making the world better for his sister.  When one sits down and really wonders what they would do with a power like Geass, one realizes what a true hero Lelouch is for not becoming completely corrupt and evil.\n        "},

It only took me a few marathon days of watching hours and hours on end to smash through the fifty episodes of the two seasons, which for me is a feat in itself considering my hectic school schedule. Even so, every minute I was away from my computer screen, my life was on hold as this extremely addictive, thought provoking and visually awesome anime played on my mind. All I could wonder about was Lelouch and his impossible conquest against\n          \n        Britannia. To put it simply, ‘Code Geass’ is the greatest anime I’ve watched to date.\nI honestly have to ask myself, where do I start? I have to say that the greatest strength of ‘Code Geass’ is its remarkable political complexity. While the subject of revolution may seem cliché and has been used in many forms of literature, film and even anime over and over again, never before have I encountered such an in-depth exposé of the subject. ‘Code Geass’ pulls no punches and fully immerses you within the world of both the fascist regime of Britannia and Zero’s ‘just’ revolutionary army known as The Black Knights. Both armies are brutal, unforgiving and ruthless, always sacrificing whatever it takes to reach their own objective. As the bloody conflict rages on you’ll constantly be asking yourself, do the ends justify the means? Is the lesser evil worth the cost? Your own morality plays an integral part in the viewing experience and if you take an interested in politics ‘Code Geass’ is a must watch, especially if you’re heavily invested in either the right or left wing.\nEven if politics isn’t your thing, ‘Code Geass’ will almost certainly have something for you. There’s an insane amount of different themes blended into the story with everything from interesting characters, comedic school life and cute romances to clever military tactics, blood and violence and even sci-fi conspiracies, super human powers and strange alternate worlds. What’s great is that none of these themes turn any of the episodes into pointless fillers, but rather take the viewer deeper into the relationship between these different themes throughout the story. For action fans itching for a fight, this might be a boring diversion but the light-hearted breaks from the bloodshed shine a light upon the injustice of both Britannia and The Black Knights as their conflict affects the entire structure of the society, involving those who never intended to be and changing their lives for better or worse.\nThis leads into the characters of ‘Code Geass’, and with a large cast of both supporting and main characters, pretty much every outlook and walk of life you could imagine is taken care of. Diversity is key here and the writers and character designers have done an amazing job of creating individuals from every facet of society. Each character is an exhibition of the type of people who’re getting caught up in the conflict. It makes you wonder how others like them around the world are coping, adding a real human element into every character even if they don’t make a major impact to the overall narrative.\nThe main protagonist, Lelouch, is nothing short of a strategic genius and could only be described as the perfect general. On the battlefield, where failure is never an option, he dons a mask and takes upon the persona of Zero, and his cold, calculating and brutally efficient style of warfare is often carried out with a disturbing level of emotional detachment. The only objective is the one that’s set prior to the mission and Zero will do anything in his power to see that objective completed, even if it means sacrificing his own troops, manipulating those in his way with geass or slaying countless innocent civilians. All this is for the simple goal of preserving his little sister Nunnally and creating his ideal world where she can live in peace. Even so, as we’re exposed to Lelouch and his persona, there’s a certain level of sympathy that we can lend to him as his traumatic past has lead him down a path of death and destruction, all for the sake of avenging his mother’s death and ensuring that Britannia’s warmongering ways will never be repeated again in the future. Is this noble goal worth the sacrifice of millions, if not billions, of people to ensure that countless more won’t be slain? This is where your morality as a viewer comes into play, and I must say, it’s a disturbing thought.\nThe artwork is another strong point of the series and really goes the extra mile to amplify the intensity of the battle scenes and showcase the fantastic array of possible futuristic technology. The sheer scope and scale of the battles, especially large combat zones crawling with thousands of Knightmare Frames, tanks, aircraft, battleships and other forms of military arsenal, send a shiver up the spine as the vast conflict rages. I highly suggest watching in HD, whether it be streamed or downloaded, as a low definition picture really wouldn’t be able to do justice to the chaotic beauty of these particular scenes and the rest of the visuals in the series. Colours are vivid and lines are clear, however if there was one complaint it would certainly be the proportions of some of the characters as they stand when we’re looking at them from afar. Their physiques are way too thin, but this is only a minor complaint as the art really struts its stuff in fast paced action sequences. When characters aren’t in their Knightmare Frames, it’s the banter that’s the more important.\nThis is more opinion than anything else but for those who’ve not yet watched the series I would recommend watching ‘Code Geass’ in English dub rather than Japanese for continuity reasons. The English voice acting is of high quality and fits every character to a tee, but the main reason is that Britannia is an empire based in North America with its capital city in what we would call the United States. There’s no reason why any of the Britannian citizens or nobles would speak Japanese, except for a select few who live in Japan, and even then, considering the distaste towards ‘Elevens’ as they’re now known, it’s unlikely that they would even make an effort to speak Japanese at all. Even the students at Ashford Academy don’t have much of a reason considering it’s a school exclusively for Britannians and Honorary Britannians and not Japanese. It would make sense for English to have become a standardised language throughout the world during this time period as Britannia is the world’s major power in terms of military, politics and trade, with Japan only being a small conquered region. Just my two cents on why the English dub is preferable over the Japanese audio.\nA further major point, as the explanation of the rules of the geass power become more and more abstract as time goes on, I would encourage some viewers to take the time to rewatch some scenes to understand just how it works because by the second season comes around, geass users, those affected by geass and the rules of geass become increasingly difficult to keep track of, which could cause a great deal of confusion for some viewers especially when it comes down to decisive moments within the story. This is also true for the philosophy of both sides and their reasoning for why they fight, as these issues become more complex as the war rages on and those fighting begin to question their reasoning behind their participation in the bloodbath.\nWith its complex take on world issues and the human condition, ‘Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion’ and it’s follow up season ‘Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion: R2’ proves to be one of the greatest anime to ever hit the small screen. While questioning your own moral compass at every turn, you’ll be biting your nails on the edge of your seat, wondering how Lelouch will command his army of Black Knights to victory and just what drives him to commit the atrocities that he orders. Is it out of hatred and vengeance for Britannia and its tyrannical regime? Or perhaps a sense of justice for the people of Japan and the rest of the world? Maybe it really is just for the sake of his little sister’s safety, or is that simply a guise to justify a lust for power? With a scale and scope I’ve personally never seen in an anime series before, you and your own morality will be the judge."},

I must say that I'm absolutely blown away by this anime in almost every way!\nStory - 9/10: \nI liked how the story continued to suprise me, even though the whole \"I need to take revenge and destroy my evil father\" thing seemed a bit cliche at first. There were many plot twist that sometimes confused me a little and left me wondering what exactly was going on but I do like that in an anime! I had to think and guess  a lot which made\n          \n        it even more interesting. \nArt - 9/10: \nThe art in this anime was really really great! It was very beautiful to look at and the character design was quite tasty (to me anyway). There might have been a little too much fanservice for my liking (nudity, breasts and such) but I guess that boys wouldn't have a problem with this at all! :)\nSound - 5/10:\nI didn't really care that much for the soundtrack. \nCharacter - 8/10:\nI liked how the different characters complemented each other. The main characters had a lot of dept and they continued to surprise me. I liked Lelouch as a main character even though he could seem very arrogant and bitchy at some times - he had his reasons. If I had to say something bad about the characters it would be that there were a few to many of them. I had a hard time remembering who was who because new characters continued to be introduced all the time. Whenever I would see a minor character I would be like \"who is he again?\". \nEnjoyment - 10/10:\nI was very well entertained with this anime! I was caught by it from the begining and I just had to keep watching and watching to know what would happen next. It had a lot of action but there were also funny moments that would make me laugh and smile. Oh and I didn't really mind that it was mecha because the giant robots were kinda awesome! \nOverall - 9/10:\nOverall I really enjoyed watching Code Geass and I would definitely see it again! It's one of the best anime I've seen in a long time!\n        "},

This show looks, sounds, and very simply is, amazing. \nNote, some small spoilers may be in here.\nStory: 10\nCode Geass has an incredible plot. The idea was genius, and the way the played out the story worked perfectly. They brought the right things into view at the right time, and they did it throughout the whole series. When I saw the first episode, I didn't leave my computers chair for anything besides eating, and no other anime has been able to do that for me since. It was that good. \nArt: 10\nCode Geass looked amazing,\n          \n        simple as that. The world looked realistic and beautiful, and the knightmares, they were on a whole new level. Never in an anime have I seen cooler Mecha than I did in Code Geass. All of them just looked simply amazing.\nSound: 8\nWhile the sound effects and voices in Code Geass were amazing, I find that the music was to be a little lacking. It may have just been the opening songs, but personally I found the music to be a less well done than the anime itself.\nCharacters: 9.5\nCode Geass had some amazing characters. Lelouche was simply incredible, and all of his friends allies and enemies were great too. So I take it your now wondering why I gave it 9.5 rather than 10. 1 reason. Nina. I don't know what it was about her, but something about her just REALLY aggravates me. However, thankfully she only played a very minor role in the series. Also, as I side note, this series has who I consider one of the most entertaining anime characters of ALL time: Earl Lloyd.\nEnjoyment:10\nNow, This show, was one of the most enjoyable shows I have and will EVER see. It had really epic action scenes, the characters were great, and the mechs, oh the mechs were great. This show was simply amazing to me.'\nOverall:10\nIf I could give this show a 12, I would. I believe it to be one of the greatest animes ever made. I recommend ANYONE watch it. Its that good\n        "},
			{["score"]=6, ["helpful"]=13, ["text"]="                          \n    I don't really understand why this anime seems to be so popular. It recieves so much praise, even unofficial 11/10 ratings. I see it on so many people's favourite lists, that you'd think it really was a masterpiece. Seriously, what the hell? How can opinions be so radically different? I'd give it at best 6/10 and that's generous. Granted I'm probably in the minority saying this, but it's just not that special. Don't get me wrong - it's still a perfectly watchable anime, however I just don't see why it draws such a disproportionate level of appeal and support.\nI guess my main issue is that\n          \n        it's supposed to have a so-called 'amazing storyline' with unexpected plot twists and surprises that just blow your mind. I found it to be anything but - to me the direction of the story and characters was leading and easily predictable, and to be honest downright boring at times. I was frequently disinterested, to the point of barely being able to resist watching something else.\nWhat really struck me was how 'western' this show felt compared to any other anime I have watched, possibly why i found the story and outcomes so predictable and mind-numbing. It was somewhat reminiscent of watching Dexter (HBO), but full of seemingly pointless mecha battles, and severely lacking in hot female characters and fanservice.\nI was really irritated by it towards the last few episodes *SPOILER ALERT* where Lelouch's crew, who had trusted him and were willing to die for an unknown masked man for basically the entire series, were swayed into betraying him, by the enemy who boarded their ship, within a single episode - and at a time when the rebellion clearly had the upper hand. Even the few crew that were aware of his true identity and had been keeping quiet the whole time also suddenly decided to become turncoats and side with their enemies whom they were bitterly fighting to the death up until a few minutes prior. What the hell is that? To me, that's another hint at western influence behind this anime, since Japanese tend to be honorable to a fault, rather than treacherous at the drop of a hat. \nI consider Code Geass highly overrated, and unjustly sensationalized into popularity for reasons I still cannot explain. Perhaps the blatant Pizza Hut advertising throughout the two series had something to do with it, which further bolsters my feeling this show was meant for a foreign audience that is easily pleased.\n\n"},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=13, ["text"]="\n                          \n    I’ve seen some beautiful art, some breathtaking innovation and some brilliant narratives in anime, but I can’t lie: this is the most profoundly interesting series I’ve seen to date. The best cut of this rare beast? It does it with grace and aplomb.\nCode Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion tells the story of a disaffected Prince and Princess to the Holy Brittanian Empire, which by way of its Knightmare Frame robots has conquered some third of the modern world. When the young Lelouch voices his anger over the apparent murder of his mother, he and his sister are discarded and their deaths imagined in soon-invaded Japan.\n          \n        A teenage Prince  under pseudonym is left brooding  and without purpose…until he stumbles upon a power at once revolutionary and ruinous.\nDecent setting: check. Interesting story: check. But there’s no great lack of any of this in modern anime; we’re talking about the Japanese here. Crazy shit to anime is as windows are to houses. Now the fancy stuff, a bit of air conditioning…that’s pace. With budget limits and gargantuan manga to adapt, it’s only too common that the anime should deviate or have to be scaled back, cut off, edited. This too often ruins what would otherwise have been a great series, often in the form of filler, and most usually in the form of the trademarked terrible ending. This is by no means clear cut, but I think Sunrise nailed both here. There are a couple of episodes in the middle of each series where the story ambles along with character development, but it soon picks up, and I never felt like they were buying time – however slow the progression of the plot was, everything seemed relevant and contributory. There are quite a lot of detail to pick up, and I found myself skipping back to a fair few subs, but it’s no onslaught.  Much of the brilliance of the story is in the casual details; it’s no murder mystery, but it is very well written, and everything comes together in a really good way.\nIn trying to be innovative beyond simple creativity, a lot of studios have also taken extreme drama and shock tactics into habit, with deaths not exactly fatuous, but secondary to the progression of the story, a steam-rolling catalyst for the anger of the protagonist. Code Geass is better than that. There’s plenty of tragedy and there are plenty of shocks, but they really are integral to the story, and their effects are eroded and balanced in the character psyches as other events and revelations take hold. This is a great thing about the story: the attitude and aims of the main character never really change, but just about everyone else’s do, and the development of contact and contrasts between the two ‘groups’ are wonderful to behold. If I had a problem with the story, it would be that the world affairs, Empire aspect is largely sidelined in the second series, and in the bouts of action and plot twists descends largely into farce behind the hero’s apparent ego…but it is a minor quibble. The change of focus to the character ultimately gives the ending the clout it needs; I’d just have liked, for the sake of a rounded drama, more of the worldly perspectives of the first season in ‘R2′.\nThe characters of Code Geass are arguably its pièce de résistance. ‘Deep and complex’ is a horrible, throwaway phrase which this series doesn’t deserve, and which doesn’t adequately describe any one person. Sure, there are clichéd archetypes in the school President, the goofy friend, even the unnaturally clever and forward-thinking Lelouch. Sure, there are a lot of series’ with slightly broken, conflicted protagonists whose aims and intentions are ultimately good, and sure, it’s nothing new to throw some dramatic irony in there for drama. But it’s just done so well. Loyalties change constantly, people and feelings are sacrificed, and perhaps most importantly, I can’t think of anyone who’s really cemented as a douche-bag. The story and character relationships develop in such a way that you can see everyone’s reasons for the way that they think, and the things that they do (sometimes catastrophically), even if you and our hero disagree with or rue them. Like I say, there is very little in this series that seems fatuous, or meaningless. It isn’t super detailed and true-to-life, capturing personalities and moments in film the way that Miyazaki does, for instance. What it is is brilliantly structured, good looking, action-packed and emotional, like a good TV drama should be. And they are rare enough gems in the big-money world of TV, even in the bigger-money (if more compressed) world of cinema. Code Geass is a feast for brain and eyes – odd at times, fast at times, slow at times, clichéd at times…but entirely enthralling.\nI wrote a while back about Elfen Lied, and how I thought – minus the ‘Japanese-ness’ – it could (and deserved to) garner some proper, cult appeal. This runs through much the same vein, with a mainstream edge; Code Geass is proper telly in every sense bar the most important one: it’s Japanese. For the unenlightened masses, an opportunity lost. For you, wholesome and brilliantly executed entertainment. Revel in it.\n        "},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=13, ["text"]="\n                          \n    [ 1 MINUTE REVIEW ]\nCode Geass is one of those rare adrenaline pumping anime that you just can’t get enough of. It is by no means overrated or overhyped. It has an excellent plot that has shocking twists, great mecha battles and intricately designed main and side characters. The story is the high point of the series and the brilliant protagonist really gets you fired up with his devastating ruthlessness and strategic abilities. Watching him mastermind seemingly impossible operations is a real blast. This series is just so enjoyable, that it leaves you begging for more. And thankfully, there is an equally stellar season two.\n          \n        The animation is fantastic and the dramatic soundtrack fits the bill. Tight screenplay ensures that the show drifts effortlessly from Shonen to Mystery to Drama effortlessly. Extremely fast pacing and over the top battles make for a fun 25 episodes. Code Geass : Watch it.\n[ 5 MINUTE REVIEW ]\nWhen I first heard about Code Geass’s storyline, I was not very impressed. I mean come on, a guy can tell anyone what to do and they’ll just do it without any hesitation? Sounded like an overpowered protagonist to me at first. And his aim? To defeat an empire which covers 1/3rd of the world. Right about now, I lost interest. But then one day I was really, REALLY bored and picked this series up. I expected a typical shonen with a guy who doesn’t talk much, a girl with a crush on him for no reason, extraordinary hidden talents, blah blah blah… And that’s basically what I got for the first few episodes. But after around the 6th episode, my oh my… the series just kick starts its engine and goes into high gear. The story from then on has a breakneck pace which will keep you at the edge of your seat for the rest of the series. \nThe story of Code Geass is that the protagonist (I didn’t use the word hero for the same reason that Yagami Light of Death Note isn’t considered a hero.) Lelouch Lamperouge, is a former prince of Britannia, the empire that controls a third of the world, renounces his title after the Britannian army massacred his family and disabled his sister. Lelouch lives on, praying each day to get revenge on the Emperor of the Britannian Empire. And one fine day, he runs into an alien girl called CC by “coincidence”. And she can grant him the power that could help overthrow the Empire – She will give him the power of Geass as long as he fulfils her one and only wish. Lelouch, of course, agrees and obtains the power of Geass. With a Geass, you can turn one of your eyes into a Geass eye and use the Geass power on any human being. And what is the Geass power? Well, if you use Geass on a person, they simply do whatever you ask them to. Yes, he can ask them to die, rollover, do pushups, make pancakes or whatever the hell he wants. And Lelouch is a master strategist, who has exceptional chess skills which builds his battle tactics. Now that he has a Geass, the power to grant ultimate obedience, taking over an empire should be simple…Right? Well, not exactly. The story is set in 2017 a.t.b where soldiers use battle bots/mechas (like the ones in Mobile Suit Gundam) called Knightmare Frames to fight. And all Knightmare Frames are insanely powerful. Thus begins the story of how Lelouch, a high school student, tries to take down the world’s largest empire using his brilliant mind and the power of Geass. To keep his identity a secret he becomes Zero, the oddly dressed savior of Japan and begins his double life.\nThe show is produced by SUNRISE, the same guys who made Gundam, so you can expect the bots, the Knightmare Frames, to look good. Transition is smooth and there is almost no recycling of frames. Almost all the bots, especially the ones that come in the later episodes, look slick. However, the character design did not appeal all that much to me. Almost every character in the anime had the same build- lanky. They look like white matchsticks. But still, all the characters look different and you rarely ever get confused. I really thought that Zero, a character you see nearly episode, could’ve had a better attire- the mask looked like an egg on a stick and his grand suit is just ridiculous and at first glance, he looks like an overdressed bartender. As far as the animation department, I am impressed and don’t have too many complaints. \nAlso, as for content warning, there are a few tit flashes, a lot of scenes where the female characters are shown being in tantalizing poses and viewed from hentai-like angles and it has tons of open gory violence so it’s definitely not recommended for kids below 14. \nThe music in Code Geass, is overall, good. The first season opening and ending theme were pretty good. Although the OP was praised by critics and fans alike, I really didn’t think it was as good they claimed it to be. As far as the background score goes, it is done well, but there is nothing standout. There were some really dramatic tracks that got your blood pumping. Not much to criticize, but not much to appreciate either.\nThe story is actually much deeper than it appears at first glance. The story also plays the Best Friend vs. Best Friend card. And I just love anime which play that card. While Lelouch tries to take down the Britannian empire, his best friend from childhood, Suzaku, tries to stop Zero. And the best part? They don’t know each other’s secret identity. In the initial episodes, Lelouch simply does not care how many people he kills and abuses his Geass to the core. Just as it is about to get stale, the story switches paths, minimizing the role of the Geass and giving greater importance to his tactical and strategic abilities. Elements of Drama and Slice of Life come into play very soon. There are constant twists in the plot, which ensures that the viewer never gets bored. Whether it may be a new Knightmare or a new character, the tight script keeps you going. \nAlthough you may initially think Code Geass is just a Death Note + Mobile Suit Gundam, you soon change your mind. Agreed, they have a lot of similarities, but it is handled and presented in a different manner. For those who are familiar with Death Note, Lelouch might seem similar to Yagami at first, but around mid-way in the series, you stop comparing the two and realize both of them are completely different characters. Code Geass is far more dramatic and emotional than Death Note. It answers several critical questions Death Note did not. And for one thing, Lelouch actually has emotions and feels the pain of having so much blood on his hands. It’s not as intelligent, sophisticated or subtle, but that’s not to say it’s a bad thing. Geass has grandeur, which surprisingly appealed to me. The balance of Code Geass continuously shifts between the power of the Geass and the power of the Knightmare Frames. \nThe characters in the anime are really good, each of them showing great depth in their personalities. The initially shallow and shonen characters soon grow and mature into subtly interesting characters. The notable side characters are Shirley, Kallen, Cornelia, Nunally, Ougi and Euphemia. The main characters ( Lelouch, CC, Suzaku ) are all excellently made and make this show a cut above the rest. \nThe ending, is well, hardly an ending. It’s like the prequel of season 2, Code Geass : Lelouch of the Rebellion R2. Yet, you will savor every moment of it. You shouldn’t have much problem choosing between the sub and the dub as both are, surprisingly, done extremely well. You should be comfortable with either.\nSo, just to answer the question in the intro, this show is not overrated, overvalued or overhyped by any means. It did not gain popularity through huge promotions or a few fanboys running forums down with their rave reviews (*winks at Naruto*). Code Geass has earned every accolade it has received. Filled with exciting, thrilling, powerful, dramatic, heartbreaking, raunchy, gripping and awe-inspiring moments, Code Geass R1 is something you don’t wanna miss.\n        "},
			{["score"]=6, ["helpful"]=13, ["text"]="                          \n    I watched this because of all the rave reviews.  My expectations were high, and I was unfortunately disappointed.  I stopped after 20 episodes, because I just couldn't get myself to waste any more time on something I didn't love, not even to see the epic cliff hanger ending that had been enough to keep me going this far.\nMy favorite animes include Gintama and the Full Metal Panic series (all 3 seasons), so you have an idea of the type of things I like-- action, comedy, etc.  In fact, because I loved the FMPs so much, I thought for sure I'd like Code\n          \n        Geass since they both are a mix of big genres like mecha, school, drama, war, etc.  Due to their similarity, I'm going to do my review on CG in comparison to FMP.\nStory-- I do like that CG involved strategery and mind games, but the whole Britannia world domination thing seemed quite propaganda-ish.  Also, while there were good plot twists here and there, the over arching conflict seemed really lame and mostly just a manifestation of teenage angst.  I also felt like it took itself too seriously at times and was overly dramatic... and did not do a good job of comic relief.  FMP also dealt with war and was dark at points, but the comic relief was executed perfectly.\nArt-- The mecha designs were pretty flashy and the animation quality was great.  I'm not a fan of the anorexic CLAMP character design, but that's a personal preference rather than a flaw of production.\nSound-- The theme songs were average anime music. The sound effects were pretty good.  Even though the tone and attitude of his voice was appropriate, I didn't think the maturity of the (Japanese) voice actor matched Lelouch's young 17 year old character.\nCharacter-- This was my biggest problem with this show... the characters whom I could care less about. FMP drastically outshined CG in character quality and development.  Lelouch just needs to take some anger management classes; I have to say, though, that his egotism is so extreme that it is almost funny.  Suzaku just needs to see a shrink about his father issues.  Angst, angst, angst.  No real depth, no real relationships.  None of the romantic connections are believable nor do I sense any ounce of true chemistry. Most of the girls just seem to be there for fan service or to fill a token plot role.  While characters like Chidori and Sousuke from FMP feel so alive, three dimensional and multi-faceted, all of the characters in CG feel flat and dull like props.  It's hard to like a show when I don't feel moved by the characters.\nEnjoyment-- Obviously I didn't enjoy Code Geass from the characters, relationships or story point-of-view, but I did enjoy the flashy mecha fights and strategery.  \nConclusion:  Given that so many people love this show, I would still recommend that you watch it and try it out for yourself.  But know that you aren't alone if you don't think this is as much of a masterpiece as everyone declares ;).\n        "},

A young Britannian boy named Lelouch accidentally gets involved with a terrorist operation the Japanese sprung on the Britannians in order to steal a war weapon. In fact, the \"weapon\" turns out to be a strange girl who gives Lelouch the power of Geass before (seemingly) being killed. Lelouch's Geass is the power to give an order\n          \n        and command absolute obedience. With this miraculous power, Lelouch decides to put his incredible brain and leadership skills into fighting the Britannian Empire, which he hates. \nGenre/Attitude\nCode Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion is only the first half of the whole saga of Lelouch, and the story continues with Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2. To fully appreciate the masterpiece of Code Geass, watching both series through to the end is essential. However, this review will only be about the first series, which is twenty-five episodes long and which aired continuously from October 2006 to July 2007. Genres for this anime include mecha, action, drama, political intrigue, psychological thriller, supernatural, and alternative history. There is a nice splash of humor in it as well and the show is \"self-aware\" enough not to take itself too seriously. That said, I consider it a very serious anime about the human mind, philosophy, and the cycle of violence. \nPopularity and Production\nTruly an anime classic, Code Geass is widely known and loved. Based on votes from almost 500,000 users, myanimelist.net rates the series at 8.82 out of 10. Similarly, based on 28,000 votes on IMDb, the series ranks at 8.7 out of 10. Code Geass DVDs sold well in both Japan and North America, and the anime received much acclaim and many awards, including best anime TV series award at the 2007 Tokyo International Anime Fair. Unlike many anime series that are based on a manga, Code Geass was born as an anime series and manga adaptations were created later. Created by Sunrise, Code Geass was directed by Goro Taniguchi and written by Ichiro Okouchi. The now-famous studio CLAMP was responsible for original character designs and the soundtrack was composed by Kotaro Nakagawa and Hitomi Kuroishi. Among the many talented Japanese voice actors, two of the most loved and known are Jun Fukuyama (Lelouch) and Ami Koshimizu (Kallen). \nStory: Appeal, Themes, and Structure  \nThe numerous stories, genres, and characters within it and their interpretations make Code Geass palatable to a wide variety of fans. That's one of the major selling points of the series. Strong female characters, a few touching family ties and friendships, and moderate levels of male-character fanservice make Code Geass a worthwhile watch for a more \"feminine\" crowd. On the other hand, fierce mecha battles, other intense fighting, female-character fanservice, and two leading male characters (Lelouch and Suzaku) make the show a great watch for the more \"masculine\" viewers. Whether you're male or female or nonbinary, you may find the show interesting with its political intrigue, discussions of idealism and philosophy, battles of wit, and excavations into the psychology of the leading characters. As you can see, Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion appeals to a large fanbase.\nWhat is the story actually about? For some, it is a story of a tragedy, how Lelouch falls in darkness using unethical methods to achieve an idealistic dream, or how Suzaku loses everything and ends up fighting his best friend. For others, Code Geass is a story of romance, depending on your \"ship\" or \"ships,\" but in my opinion giving the most attention to the tragic CC and her odd relationship with Lelouch. Code Geass is also a story of friendship, involving everyone at Ashford Academy and some outside of it. It is an alternative history of a revolution, as well, and the story of a failing but fighting country in the face of brutal invaders. For others still, it is simply the first half of the story of Lelouch, a boy that many fans can empathize with. Perhaps it is a story of the power of sibling or familial love, given Lelouch's reasons for fighting his battles. Other fans still watch Code Geass simply for the mecha fights, and remain un-invested in any deeper story. For all those interested in story, however, Code Geass will be a treat, and will most likely prove to be thought-provoking.    \nThe structure of this first season of Code Geass is interesting to me as someone who writes and studies stories, regardless of the media form that presents them. You could say Code Geass reads like a well-planned novel, with each chapter (episode) giving the required information, the right amount of character and world development, and fascinating literary tools such as parallel characters, foreshadowing, irony, and more. I heartily enjoy structure, so here is my analysis. You can think of Code Geass as having five \"arcs\" or \"books\" where each episode strongly ties into the next one.\n Episodes 1-6 establish Lelouch, his power, the start of his battles, and his background as well as developing the parallel protagonist Suzaku as his simultaneous friend and enemy. Episodes 7-11 show the battles with Britannia led by Lelouch as the iconic hero, \"Zero,\" and his followers the \"Black Knights.\" Episodes 12-16 can be thought of as two interconnected arcs featuring the key characters of first Shirley and then Mao. Episodes 17-20 continue the story of battles as well as once again comparing and contrasting the characters and paths of Lelouch and Suzaku, and the romantic relationship between Suzaku and Euphemia. Episodes 21-25 form the final \"arc,\" wherein the fate of Euphemia leads to the culmination of Zero's war and the final emotional face-off between Lelouch and Suzaku.  \nArt: Mecha Animation and CLAMP Characters\nAlthough Code Geass was made in 2006 (11 years ago as of this article), its animation remains palatable (though different) to fans both old and new. Even as someone who isn't invested in the mecha genre, I greatly appreciate how much work and detail was put into the series' mechas, where very little, if any, CG is used. \nAs mentioned, Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion was created and animated by studio Sunrise, with character designs by CLAMP, a group of well-known female manga artists that formed in the 1980s. They have received wide acclaim and many awards, producing a great number of works, especially in the 90s and early 2000s.Not everyone is a fan of the art style, but I find it fascinating, eye-catching, unique, and well-suited for anime as well as manga.  Although some fans may find the lack of realism jarring (bright hair and eye colors that do not naturally occur, bizarre hairstyles, and tall, thin bodies), I believe this helps make the characters unforgettable. Also note that some aspects of the character design for Suzaku (somewhat spiky brown hair and green eyes) later became common designs for many anime MCs. I believe Code Geass gets the credit for this.     \nSound: Acting and Original Sound Track\nEarlier, I mentioned two of the star seiyuu (voice actors/actresses) in Code Geass, Jun Fukuyama and Ami Koshimizu. This is not one of those series where the star characters are the only striking actors. I find the voice acting throughout the series to be superb, with a variey of talents, some of whom don't commonly show up in other anime. (An example is actor, director, and composer Tetsu Shiratori, who played the side character of Professor Lloyd.)\n Takahiro Sakurai (Suzaku) and Jouji Nakata (Diethard) are examples of memorable seiyuu that have more than two hundred acting credits according to IMDb, and are now widely known for such series as Polar Bear's Cafe and Fate/Zero, respectively. My personal favorite, Jun Fukuyama (Lelouch) has since played unforgettable characters such as Koro-sensei in Assassination Classroom, Grell from Black Butler, and lead character Craft Lawrence from Spice and Wolf. \nFew of the opening or ending songs for Code Geass really stuck out at me, but the first OP, \"Colors\" by FLOW, is memorable in its own way, and the beautiful song \"Alone\" appears in episodes 6 and 21. (The only name I could find associated with it is \"Hitomi,\" and the lyrics are nonsensical, but the vocals and the melody are soothing and gorgeous.) Kotaro Nakagawa composed the OST scores for Code Geass and I believe his unusual style is widely underrated. The music is often described as dramatic but elegant, and incorporates underused elements such as fast percussion, trumpets, acoustic guitar, and unusual vocal rhythms. A personal favorite is the track \"Noblesse Oblige,\" which paints the perfect picture of the arrogant Britannian aristocracy. \"Innocent Days\" is a haunting and beautiful score with female vocalists. \"The Black Knights\" score is often used in suspenseful situations or battles during the anime. Note that all of these examples are from the season one OST. \nCharacters\nOnce you have seen a few episodes of Code Geass, you'll find it difficult to forget the characters. This is largely thanks to their popular seiyuu and their unique visual designs, but even excluding those elements, the cast of Code Geass was well-developed and interesting. Considering the great number of characters, the series does a good job presenting parts of the personalities of each. Granted, some characters go less developed than others; for example, the motivations and background of C.C. are largely unclear until the second season, though her personality is pictured well. While a few of the major female characters seem one-dimensional and don't appear often enough (such as Nunnally), others like Kallen/Karren are well developed and presented from start to finish. Despite the show giving into some fanservice and giving fans excuses to \"ship\" practically any couple, the main characters stay consistent with who they really are. \nMost Code Geass fans will agree that the most fascinating character is Lelouch. His semi-sociopathic traits of charisma, great intellect, proud nature, and sometimes cruel decisions are strangely coupled with his obvious humanity, powerful love for his sister, loneliness and isolation, and core wish of wanting to protect the weak. His views on morality are refreshing to some fans, though they make him an \"anti-hero\" to others-- in particular, his opinion that results always matter more than methods, and the ends justify the means. The character of Suzaku, the more typical hero-type person who cannot agree with Zero's methods, serves as an excellent contrast to Lelouch. Suzaku is interesting in his own right thanks to his battles with his own hypocrisy, and the shame he feels over an action in the past that makes him all but eager to throw his life away.      \nEnjoyment \nThough Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion was made in 2006, I only saw just saw it about two and half years ago in 2014. Despite the fact that the anime is \"before my generation,\" I greatly enjoyed it, considering it an anime masterpiece far better than the anime I see coming out in recent years. Some specific things I liked about the show were the character parallels between Lelouch and Suzaku, the fact that the show isn't preachy, and the character of my favorite sincere yet reckless and hypocritical knight, Suzaku. \nDepending on how you look at it, Lelouch and Suzaku could be seen as fundamentally different (because of their respective value systems) or as fundamentally similar (because of their desire for \"justice\"). They are bitter enemies and closely bonded childhood friends at the same time. Each must ask himself many of the same questions on his personal journey. Code Geass shows parallelism of characters at its best. \nDespite themes of death, revolution, justice, terrorism, patriotism, and heroes, Code Geass (thankfully) is not preachy about values. Viewers are free to believe what they want without pressure from the show or favoratism showed to specific characters. Characters that other shows would be quick to dismiss as \"evil,\" are presented as they are in Code Geass, and the viewer is even given the chance to empathize with them. Take, for an example, Governor-General Cornelia, a daughter of the Britannian Emperor. It would be easy to say she is a racist tyrant who has killed countless people. Despite this, we are shown Cornelia's sincere love for her sister Euphemia, and as an elder sister, I can understand how she feels later in the season. \nI would love to end with an exploration of my favorite character Suzaku, but that would involve too many spoilers. So, alas, that wraps up my review of the first season of Code Geass. Now go and enjoy this classic series for yourself."},
			{["score"]=7, ["helpful"]=6, ["text"]="                          \n    (Disclosure - at the time of writing, I have not yet seen R2, this show's second season)\nCode Geass is an amalgam of nearly every popular anime genre - mecha battles, supernatural mystery, brainiac rivalries a la Death Note, alternate (future) history, high school slice of life, romance, pizza hut commercial. What's even crazier is that, in many ways, the show actually succeeds in each of these genres. However, given the breadth of subject matter and the large cast of characters, ultimately we are left with a show that lacks focus, and suffers as a result.\nTo handle the most obvious things first, the art style of\n          \n        this show is... conspicuous. While this is the first CLAMP show I've seen, I had been aware that they had a characteristic style. While the show's impossibly tall, thin characters aren't poorly designed, as such, it's definitely an acquired taste that I never quite acquired. Often I found the clearly deliberate choice to make the characters gastrointestinally impossible beanpoles off-putting - the tone of the show is quite a bit more serious than the lanky shounen dreamboats would suggest. Zero especially suffers from this, as it's hard to take seriously a military mastermind who looks like he'll roll up and blow away at any minute. I realize that this is a matter of taste, though, and it's not all bad. In particular the facial expressions are excellent and do an even better job of conveying the characters' emotions than the script does. The mecha battles are also fast and fluid, but never hard to follow. The battle choreography is top-notch and really expresses the speed at which the battles take place.\nThe show's biggest issue is the scope. As mentioned above, it manages to shove nearly every major genre into one show, and while each of these elements of the show, taken on their own, actually hold up pretty well, the show simply isn't long enough to do any one aspect of it justice (other than perhaps the mecha battles). Right off the bat protagonist LeLouch is given a mysterious supernatural power, with the requisite \"ground rules\" that govern its use, but the how and why of this is not really explored. The power comes with a mysterious cutie named C.C., and we're given tantalizingly few glimpses into her past and the nature of this power, but the series can't commit to exploring this (or her) further, because it's too busy having the president of the high school student council dress up like a cat and then bake the world's largest pizza. The result is that the show feels disjointed and tonally inconsistent. I would much rather the series have focused on Zero's ambitous grab for power and the fallout of his actions. When the show is focusing on these elements it is at its strongest, but too often it is interrupted by the aforementioned pizza worship.\nAnother element that further bifurcates the focus of the show is the massive cast of characters. This is something of a double-edged sword, as while the characters themselves are actually pretty interesting and manage to each be fairly distinct and memorable, there are just so many of them that almost none are given enough screentime. They each have their own plots, too, which further eats into the amount of time available for exploring the show's themes, but Code Geass actually redeems itself here by having each of these plots, no matter how small, drive the plot forward in some pretty ingenious ways. I actually almost gave up on the show midway through because it seemed to get completely lost in its own cast, and subplots were introduced and rapidly concluded without seeming to lead anywhere. Impressively, the last few episodes tie together nearly all of the different plots and characters, and in particular the later story beats justify the amount of time spent on setting everything up.\nPacing and scope issues aside, Code Geass is a solid show for fans of mecha combat and complex plotting, or skinny, skinny dudes and dudettes. It's often billed as \"Death Note with mechas,\" but besides the intelligence of the main character, there's really not that much in common.\n        "},

			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=12, ["text"]="\n                          \n    Code Geass is one of the most well-known and loved anime of all time. Why? Because of it's grand, theatrical story that has tons of plot twists and turns. When I had first watched this, I was turned off by the mecha aspect of the anime, but went on to watch it because I was intrigued by it's \"change the world for the better\" psychological aspect (+ obviously it's crazy popularity). I am happy to tell you that Code Geass exceeded my expectations in both aspects, the anime was fantastic and definitely worth the watch, for everybody. \n“If strength is justice, then is powerlessness a\n          \n        crime?” - Lelouch Lamperouge Vi Britannia\nThis one quote pretty much sums up the anime. Social hierarchy in society. Equity among the people. Fairness. What the right form of government is, what the right way to rule the people are. Secrets, Deceits, Revenge, Power-Corruption, Friendship/Hatred, Love, Temptation, Evil/Good. This is a story of a classic hero's psychological and political struggle in his reality (similar to our reality)\nCode Geass put simply revolves around an abandoned prince of the Holy Brittanian Empire (think of it like a royal country like Great Britain, but has the world power of the US), Lelouch Vi Britannia and his journey into rebelling against his father, King Charles Vi Britannia and creating a new world/society. Of course, the story would have been nice (possibly boring though) if it was more realistic; Code Geass is NOT realistic what-so-ever despite these true disgusting aspects of our reality being portrayed ingeniously. Lelouch obtains the \"Power of the Kings\" (Geass Power) that makes anyone who looks him in the eye directly obey his command. Using this power, the grand tale of Lelouch Lamperouge Vi Britannia unfolds. This is a psychological and political anime. The ideologies in the anime were beautifully portrayed and clashed with one another. Is murder wrong? Even if it means saving more people? What about \"justice\", how do we fairly carry out justice? Evil? Good? How do we distinguish between them? Human Nature, can we ever change it? Fate and Destiny, does it exist? Hope. What is hope? Is there hope for our world? The story has a buttload of questions with twists and turns that'll blow some people's minds and enlighten others. Overall the anime is quite fast-paced and doesn't linger around useless dialogue too often, which makes the anime all the more entertaining and captivating. Though, because of this there are a number of plot-holes here and there, leaving questions unanswered and thus confusing the viewers as to what happened to the ____, or ____. Furthermore a big problem with Code Geass' plot is because it seemed like the writers couldn't decide whether they wanted to add in school-life into the anime, but why add that into an anime that's something like a second coming of Hitler-World Domination story... The school scenes were touching~ly pathetic and a waste of Code Geass' time. But... that's okay, Code Geass' main plot was still superb. Like honestly, on paper, there are so many things about Code Geass that shouldn’t work. It's overall elements don’t really blend together; the mix of high school drama with the liberation of Japan via use of mechas' is quite the strange combination. Things that shouldn't be connected are, and outside the classroom the same characters are fighting each other in a war for freedom, like uh... what the hell. But somehow Code Geass makes it work. No, they make it into one hell of a masterpiece. Plus a side-bonus about the overall plot I really liked was that although there's one obvious \"main\" plot, there are also lots of sub-set plots as well that end up intertwining with the main plot to eventually create a satisfying (*cough* cliff-hanger *cough*) end. \nCharacters is one of all the points that Code Geass really excelled at, despite having a second main character that absolutely sucks balls: Suzaku Kurushit... But whatever who cares about him when there's the soul and heart of Code Geass, the most popular anime character ever, Emperor Lelouch Lamperpouge Vi Britannia. Lelouch is quite the unrealistic and childish character who somehow makes a great tragic hero that the audience can watch with respect and compassion as he strives to become an evil greater than evil itself in order to overcome evil and change the world for the better, yet maintain his humanity and pure dreams. Lelouch is quite the courageous, manipulative/smart and morally ambiguous (good or evil) character; my favorite type of main character. His character is pretty deep if I do say so myself. Lelouch was betrayed by his family, his loved ones, and eventually his friends. Lelouch was betrayed by the rotten world. With his burning hatred for the rotten world, he becomes a masked legend-knight serving for \"Justice and Truth\"; he's known as Zero. Lelouch never revealing his identity by wearing a mask symbolizes his lack of a true identity. Throughout the anime, Lelouch is struggling to truly find his identity. Lelouch is always at a constant battle with not only the world, but with himself. As Lelouch goes further and further in achieving his dreams, he is forced to make harsher and harsher choices and keep himself from crossing the line into the point of corruption and insanity (Lelouch is literally like a non-psychopathic and \"Good and Genius\" version of Hitler). Lelouch is truly a tragic hero: The wise Aristotle and Shakespeare stated that a Tragic Hero had to be \n1. Of Noble Status (Lelouch is the Prince of the Holy Britannian Empire and later literally becomes King of the entire world) \n2. Hamartia - Have a tragic flaw that eventually leads to his downfall, which you'll see in Lelouch constantly throughout the series.\n3. Peripeteia - a reversal of fortune brought about by the hero's tragic flaw. Lelouch's downfall towards the end of the first season (this season)\n4. And finally in his downfall, his actions result in an increase of self- awareness and self-knowledge. He reaches a sense of \"Enlightenment\" and sends a message to the viewers. # The audience must feel pity and fear for this character. -- This is Lelouch. His end acceptance of his consequences.\nThe characters all have unique ideals and motives, which causes conflict throughout the entire series. The characters are portrayed in a way that makes it difficult to determine who exactly is in the right. Even if your ideals are just, do the ends justify the means? Can you truly change anything with out taking huge, and sometimes costly, risks? These are some of the questions the characters are constantly struggling with. Code Geass also does a great job showing the humanity of the characters. There is genuine joy, and happiness, and there are moments of intense rage, and bitter sadness. The main characters in this series are well rounded and developed. C.C (whose identity is never revealed but in Greek Mythology C.C = Circe, whom is a sorcerer, a source of temptation for heroes which reflects C.C's role in Code Geass). Even though we don’t get as much information on the supporting characters, they all play their parts well too. They are unique, and they all add something different to the overall story. All characters are 3 dimensional and their own specific personalities shape what they do. Everyone has a fatal flaw take adds a lot towards the story. Characters: 10/10. \nThe art was stunningly beautiful, it looks as high quality as anime made in 2014, such as the Fate series. The characters were all distinctively different, which is quite tragically not the case for most anime. Lelouch = Royal, C.C = Beautiful~ Suzaku can go die~ The mecha were nicely designed, but I won't say that I enjoyed watching the mecha because I despise mecha. The sound of Code Geass is another aspect where the show really excelled. The openings very nice--they give a great impression of what's to come in the anime. But.. the endings were mehhh... The soundtrack was great, especially \"The Master\", \"Madder Sky\" \"Stories\" and \"Continued Stories\"; beautiful~ The music certainly added to the suspense of the fight/dramatic scenes, and the feels of the sad/touching scenes. The voice cast was great, both sub and dub (yes, even dub, in fact in my opinion Code Geass' dub was even better than the sub). Lelouch's voice was way too deep to fit Lelouch in the sub, but Johnny Yong Bosch fit/executed Lelouch' voice perfectly in the dub. \nCode Geass was a thrilling ride from beginning to end (Season 2 isn't as good as Season 1 but the ending... The end of the entire show [season 2] is probably the greatest ending I've ever seen to a show). Code Geass is a classic, and it’s one you probably won’t want to miss out on. Overall, I'd go to the point of calling Code Geass an iconic anime; a model for future psychological \"tragic hero\" masterpieces to come. Sure you may not like the anime, but Code Geass is definitely a show you should give a try and decide for yourself whether you like it or not.  \n        "},

Don't be discouraged if it contains elements you are not in favor of, mechas being in my case. This series contains far more depth than you could imagine, don't judge it by the outside.

If you watch it expecting for it to be like DN, you may end suffering a lot. \nThen why so many people recommend it? Are they all nuts? \nWell, it's because the main character looks and acts like kira. \nBut believe me , he's no kira. \nDon't get me wrong, this show not bad at all, and its has a little voice of his own. But if you keep comparing it\n          \n        to Death note, you will realize some its obvious mistakes, like when a 'plan' its half assed, or when it was impossible altogether, or  the constant feeling that you might be smarter than the main character ( something that in DN will be a heresy) because you could had it done better. \nWorse of all, DN needed no mechas, no wars, no fan service nor bishoujo characters (well, just one) to be entertaining. It was the pure intellectual combat that made it so thrilling and that kept you asking for more, just that. \nThere's nothing of sort here. Lelouch intelligence is constantly unmatched, and only his own screw ups keep the plot flowing. His enemy is not another genius but a guy who could have been the main character in evangelion.  Destiny replaces long term strategies and Mecha fights replace deep thinking. \nBasically I am saying that you can put lipstick in to a Gundam, but its still a Gundam. And that's what's this series is , just another Gundam arc( Gundam Geass, if you like)  and the only difference with it predecessors is that a guy like Light is the good guy in stead of the bad one. Thats not change we can believe in.  \nYet, even if its not as good as Death note, its still better than most of the things out there. There's a whole in the market for something like DN , and this is as good as its gets right now. And it might be worth giving it a try if only for the fact that everyone else has seen it and you will look like an ignorant if they start making geass jokes or adding Li Brittania to their names and they find you staring blank. \nAnd it might mark the beginning of something, an era where intelligence and not emoish behaviour while piloting a giant robot is admired, and where thought replaces sticking fingers into some ass as the weapon of choice. CG isn't there yet, but it might be the first step."},
			{["score"]=5, ["helpful"]=12, ["text"]="                          \n    *** I tried to be vague, but when talking about characters below I gave a small spoiler from the first couple episodes relating to one of the characters. Skip Suzaku's paragraph if you don't want a slight spoiler ***\nThis is an anti-hero tale. It's based in a world where a militaristic society has taken over most of the world, and it oppresses those that it conquers. The emperor has a strong conquers the weak mentality, and his beliefs are pretty extreme. A hidden and disgraced prince is the main character of this story. He starts out as a good guy, and though his ultimate goal\n          \n        is for the greater good (long term) he does a lot of morally questionable things to reach his goals. The power he obtains in the beginning (his geass) is said to isolate him from everyone in the end, and it's easy to see how that will happen as the story unfolds.\nI'll start with the two main characters, since they are the key characters in this story. They were friends as children. One is a prince in hiding, and the other is the former leader of Japan's son. \nLelouch and Suzaku are supposed to be two sides of the same coin. However, they're not so dissimilar that I agree with that. They both are incredibly selfishly driven, but they simply end up on opposing sides even though their ultimate goal is the same. One is the brains, and the other is the brawn. Truthfully it is silly how Suzaku keeps getting in the way, and it's almost an unbelievable fact but not in a good way since the mech fighting scenes are not practical.\nLelouch is very intelligent and the storytelling never contradicts his intellect. He only loses when the completely unexpected happens which is basically when others act completely out of character. The irony is that happens more often than it should. He definitely does some morally questionable things throughout the story, but when you get to see the opposition it becomes difficult to disagree with his ideals. One element never changes, and that is Lelouch has a master plan and a goal that he will do anything to attain. Nobody else even has an idea of what that is, or that they are merely pieces on a chessboard.\nSuzaku's ideals are supposed to be for the greater good in that he doesn't want innocent people to be harmed by a rebellion. He thinks that following the rules is the just and righteous path. The sad truth is that he's a soldier for an army that constantly murders innocent civilians and persecutes them. In the very beginning he is almost murdered by a superior and then framed and nearly executed. We're talking first couple episodes folks. Even knowing this he thinks it's wrong to go against the system. His selfish need for atonement drives his ideals, and though he's supposed to be the one attempting to follow a more righteous path, he is on just as destructive a path as Lelouch. The difference between the two is that Lelouch knows his path is one of destruction, and he knows the pains he will have to suffer to accomplish his goals. Suzaku represents hypocrisy at it's finest. I really started to dislike his character as time went on.\nThen there's the story. If you summarize it, then it sounds like an incredible series. Unfortunately, the delivery is completely flawed in so many ways. There are scenes that are crammed with dialogue and void of all dramatic emotion, and then you have long and uneventful scenes void of all emotion as well. The action scenes that are in the series are mediocre at best, and really not believable in how they transpire. The animation was ok, the supporting characters were just ok, but the overall story was very good. It was fast when it should have been slow and slow when it should have been fast, so the pacing really killed it. Frankly, I was incredibly disappointed. Oh, and if you are wondering about the music, then don't wonder. It's not a big help to the story at all. Thankfully there is a second season to follow, but do not expect a well presented first season, and don't expect to be wowed in any kind of way.\nThere are plenty of twists and turns. There are lots of betrayals, but the delivery itself is sort of a betrayal when you look at the potential of this series. I wanted to love it, but I just sort of liked it.\n        "},

After hearing many positive things about Code Geass, I decided to take a look. I was neutral about mecha anime and decided to take a shot at it. I was surprised and absolutely LOVED it.\nStory: *put synopsis here*\nToo many loose and cliffhanging ends. That makes it up by plot, character developments, and drama. It's leaving you eager to watch some more episodes. For some, the fast pace of the story might drive you away.\nSeems like Code Geass focuses on drama, heart-breaking moments, and emotion, VERY unlike Death Note. Code Geass has many,\n          \n        many memorable scenes.\nArt & Animation: Very colorful. Great and well-drawn. The fights aren't really smooth or fluid, but the animation is perfect for this type of series.\nSound: The openings and endings aren't really memorable, but rather extremely fitting for this type of anime. The voices are really good and fitting. Great choice for each character.\nCharacter: There are characters you're going to hate to death and there are characters you're going to love to death, that's for sure. Some of the characters are a little cliched, but some others are just amazing. Something unexpected might happen to all of them, though.\nEnjoyment: I've chuckled at times, my heart was touched at times. I was amazed. One moment, crying, another moment, smiling.\nOverall: An awesome anime with tons of drama, emotion, and interesting characters, you wondering what will happen to them.\n        "},
			{["score"]=7, ["helpful"]=12, ["text"]="                          \n    no spoilers!\nCode Geass starts with off with such a bang and a memorable protagonist right from the beginning.  It's such a shame how close this series was to being great because I really do like it.  It's just that it's not anywhere near to being perfect.  There were so many flaws in its storytelling and characters with the plot driven many times by coincidence, I can't help but think that the story was improvised half way through.\nThe anime starts off with revealing the setting in an alternate time course.  The American's lose in the revolution against the British, and now the\n          \n        British continues their reign of imperialism.  The empire, Britannia (why the name change? I don't know...), practically takes over the world and renames each country into an area.  It brings up an interesting aspect of this show because of how the Britannian's are portayed; they're so unbelievably evil and proud in displaying their bigotry, I question why the main characters are the only ones in expressing the slightest bit of humanity to the Japanese, now renamed elevens.  Like I hinted in the previous sentence, Code Geass takes place in Japan.  Britannia continues their colonization and has taken over Japan after 200 years after the American's defeat.  Now the Elevens live in the ruins of their country, while the Britannians live wealthy lives in the colony.  I'm just surprised on how quick it developed through immigration in just around 10 years.\nOur protagonist, Lelouch Lamperouge, lives so lazily as if he has no purpose in life.  The world is under so much inequality, Lelouch carelessly accepts it.  We see that he is the typical lazy smart cool good-looking kid at school, all of it being revealed in just one episode: he ditches class to play chess where he easily wins against other renowned players, then leaves with his sidekick on a bike where he lays back reading Hamlet, later to receive a call from Shirley, the cute girl from his school's student body who easily hints her crush on Lelouch (zomg popular guy!!!!).  As he rides with his sidekick on that cool bike of theirs, Lelouch gets caught up in the middle of terrorist activity, meets his closest childhood friend, Suzaku, on the badguy's side-a scene that closely resembles Gundam SEED-, and inherits powers that I will not reveal (though you'll probably hear it from someone else); all of this being the first elaborate coincidence of the anime-we can let that slide.  After Lelouch gets his new powers, the plot quickly shifts to tactical warfare and leads a rebellion against Britannia.  With this promising premise (you have to watch it to overlook its ridiculousness.  That's how it is with animes), Lelouch's rebellion is one hell of a show.  This show features so much intense battles and tactical comebacks that it's such a thrill to watch.  Watching this is easily entertaining with its clean bright animation and likable character designs from CLAMP.  Sunrise never disappoints with their budget in terms of animation and voice acting.\nThe plot reveals soon that Lelouch was actually a Britannian prince, but denounced his father for ignoring his mother's death and so is thrown away along with his crippled sister, Nunnally.  Under the care of the Prime Minister of Japan, Lelouch and Nunnally befriend the son of the Prime Minister, Suzaku.  Britannia soon colonizes Japan (talk about evil), and war breaks away Lelouch from Suzaku.  I'm glad that they don't spend massive amount of episodes in revealing all of this like what many other animes tend to do, because that would definitely slow the pacing of the current plot, which is incredibly entertaining.  Lelouch makes himself a memorable character with his villainous-like qualities and also benefits from his voice actor who gives a great enthusiastic performance.\nUnfortunately, the story suddenly lags at the half point and relies on coincidences that are no longer elaborate.  I can't reveal the story but I'll give an example: Lelouch and Kallen have no way to escape from the enemy and easily steal a powerful knightmare that benefits them greatly.  There are other moments that are just so stupid that it almost ruins the entire anime for me.\nThe story also lags from smaller arcs that don't add much to the plot except one small aspect, like the Shirley and Mao portion.  Though mediocre at worst, it's very disappointing because it cannot compare to the pacing from the beginning of the series.  It feels as though this series is stalling a bit before it gets to the main point.\nThe series also features a huge cast that the subplots may get in the way.  These subplots don't add much to the main plot and don't fulfill the task of character development.  Because of the weak character development, the minor characters feel more like a cheap plot device rather than an important part of the show. \nIt's an overall good series but its negatives bring down the series a lot that I don't rank it up there along with other greats.  Still, I recommend it as this is one of those series that you can't really go against."},

			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=7, ["text"]="                          \n    I've mentioned Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch once before, when I mentioned that the main actors from Gakuen Heaven also voiced lead characters in this. The series was brought to us by Sunrise in 2006-2007. It's an original work by the same studio that brought us the Gundam franchise and many, many other anime. Let's take a look at Code Geass and see how they did with this one.\nStory:\nCode Geass is set in an alternate future where there are three great powers, the Chinese Federation, the EU and the imperialistic Britannia. Japan has been brought under Britannian rule and lost its name, being called area\n          \n        11. One day, a Britannian student named Lelouch Lamperouge accidentally falls into a truck being taken by a Japanese resistance group. On board is a strange canister and Lelouch finds himself taken for a ride while Britannian forces chase the group. In the process, the canister opens and a strange woman comes out. Lelouch's old friend, Kururugi Suzaku, catches up to them, attached to the Britannian forces as an honorary Britannian. He's ordered to kill the two and refuses, getting shot by the commanding officer. The woman is shot as well, psychically granting Lelouch a contract afterwards. This gives him the titular Geass, the power to give anyone an order that they can't disobey. Lelouch figures that out and decides to use it for the one thing he wants the most, to destroy Britannia and he plans to start by liberating Japan. To accomplish this goal, he disguises himself, taking the moniker Zero and takes command of resistance forces. \nThe biggest flaw with the series is the ending. A lot of multi-series anime I've reviewed will finish their first series with some kind of big climax that gives you some closure to one of the major sub-plots but that leave more to accomplish. In Code Geass, the entire first series ending is a giant cliffhanger. It's a right mess that's focused on setting things up for the second series rather than on giving the audience any real closure. Does it make you want to watch the second series? Absolutely. But it doesn't make for a satisfying stopping point, at all. The second biggest issue is with the advertising. This series just really wants you to buy Pizza Hut. The advertising is pretty shameless and it comes up quite a bit as a visual element in various scenes. It's a bit distracting.\nOn the positive side, the main narrative is really compelling and the series is really good about establishing its rules early on so that it has its major plot elements in place when it needs them to become important. I like that the major conflict has facets to it and verisimilitude. The series is also big on consequence, which I appreciate. It really plays up the idea that Lelouch's actions are impacting real people. The quieter, more slice of life moments can also be really funny and serve the important purpose of giving the audience more of an opportunity to connect with the characters and letting them unwind from the action and more serious aspects of the series.\nCharacters:\nThe cast of characters is pretty large and, mostly, pretty well developed. They seem like actual people. The friendship between Lelouch and Suzaku is really well done, as is their antagonism on the battlefield. It's interesting to compare Lelouch's more pragmatic approach to Suzaku's more idealistic. Lelouch also has a really strongly developed relationship with his little sister, Nunnally. His protectiveness of her is definitely his most endearing character facet. I also like that the various resistance members are portrayed as having different motives for fighting and even goals for when it's all over. It really makes them read as more human.\n\nArt:\nMy biggest issue with the artwork is the character designs. You can tell that Clamp worked on the designs. The character limbs are really elongated and their bodies are incredibly thin, giving them an emaciated appearance. It's not nearly as bad as the Clamp proportions in, say, Xxxholic, but they still look pretty awkward. That being said, the action sequences are really well done and I like the mecha designs. Particularly for the various unique robots. The visual geass effect also looks pretty nice.\nSound:\nThe voice acting is really good. Fukuyama Jun, Sakurai Takahiro, Yukana and Koshimizu Ami all give strong performances, as do the various side characters. About the weakest you get is Shiratori Tetsu, who really plays up the “mad scientist” aspect of his character with an odd vocal quality that really doesn't sound natural. It's still not a bad performance, it's just not on par with the others. The music is pretty good as well.\nHo-yay:\nThere's a little bit. Milly likes to grope other girls and Nina develops a really massive crush on another girl.\nFinal Thoughts:\nThat's Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch, series 1. It's a really good series with a strong narrative. Well-crafted characters and strong acting. It has its flaws but, overall, nothing too bad that would ruing the experience. My final rating is going to be a solid 8/10. Maybe I'll look at the second series at a later date but, for next week, it's going to be Kekkai Sensen.\n        "},
			{["score"]=5, ["helpful"]=5, ["text"]="                          \n    I found out about Code Geass through a friend who gave it glowing praise, so my review may be tainted by the fact that my expectations were unrealistically high for an action mech anime, but here goes with a good ol' unpopular opinion: Code Geass does not deserve the praise it gets.\nStory - I absolutely LOVED the twists and turns in the story and I was always on the edge of my seat throughout every episode. The plot is ridiculously good (ignoring the normal plot holes) and I really enjoyed the contrasts between normal, everyday life and insane mech battles and action! If there's one\n          \n        thing that this season deserves, it's high praise for its story.\n 'So what's so bad, if you loved it so much?' - you may ask.\nThe writers seemed to be unable of ending an episode without a massive plot twist or cliffhanger, and they didn't need to do this! The story was gripping and outstanding enough to keep me interested all the way through without the unnecessary cliffhangers. It was especially annoying that these cliffhangers could be resolved within the first few minutes of the next episode, and that they didn't mean anything in the long run. \nArt - The art style is what causes this anime to lose out, in my opinion. The characters look stunning when in action poses, with their angular bodies and long limbs, however, they look borderline broken when doing normal things! Another quarrel I have with the art is that the character designs are downright ugly- there were no characters that looked appealing to me and usually with a series I can find AT LEAST one character who can be labeled as 'pretty'. The colours were awful (I'm looking at CC's hair mainly here) and the clothing designs looked like the team has just given up after they finished the mechs.\nAh, right- the mechs. Oh, the mechs! If anything about the art was ridiculously cool it was the mechs! Beautifully drawn and animated, they really brought the series to life, and I forgave most of its sins just for another glimpse at those giant robots. \nSound - The soundtrack was not noticeable but it did add emotion to certain moments (which I won't mention because spoilers) and caused me to cry like a baby. The opening themes, however, were extremely out of place. They would've better-made sense in a sport or slice-of-life anime than this! And the footage to go with it was reused from the anime or just still images of the characters!! I had a lot of trouble being hyped by the openings for this season.\nCharacter - The characters were interesting and their motivations were plausible (somewhat, anyway) and I couldn't help but find myself falling in love with them. I cared about them and their struggles to the point where I would cry with them or on their behalf! The team did a really amazing job with the characters and I honest-to-god actually wrote an entire psychology essay on Lelouch because of how intriguing he is.\n However, some characters really, really fall short of the mark and I couldn't care less about them. Namingly, CC. She's very weak, for a character who appears in most episodes. She has little to no character development and her only clear character traits are 'likes pizza' and 'can be sassy when she tries'. She really ruined this series for me, and her inclusion in it felt forced at best, considering she was a sort of 'deus-ex-machina' in the plot and many of the character's struggles would have been much more interesting if we hadn't been conditioned to know 'CC always saves the day'. She's bland and boring and I hate her. She ALONE brings the score for character down from a ten to a low 8. \nEnjoyment - I have to say, I really enjoyed the series while I was watching it, however, after finishing it I felt cheated. Looking back over it, I saw all of its flaws and setbacks. So it now has no rewatch value for me. I feel like it's enjoyable to watch once, but when I watched it again to show it to a friend, I was unfathomably bored because all of the twists and turns were familiar territory by then, and the emotion had gone stale. \nOverall - While it has some plus points and some minus points, the plus points to outweigh the minus points, and I did really like the series when I watched it. Look, I'm not saying it's absolute crap and that you shouldn't watch it (in fact, I think its pretty good for a newcomer to the mech genre), I'm just saying that there's a lot better out there and that this isn't the only mech anime that you can use to get into the genre! If you're not watching from a critical point of view, or with massively high expectations, you will probably really enjoy it! \n\n"},

His choice of colors and use of movement and focus within the frame really help you pay attention to what you need to pay attention to, while also not skimping out and leaving out detail if your eyes do decide to stray, which I recommend you do while watching Code Geass film for every blur, light flare, and particle floating along the screen really do add incredible amounts of emotion to the scene/screen.\nSound:9\nmusic comes from a band of FLOW, who do not know the band FLOW already well-known long in Japan, not only FLOW, there JINN, ACCESS, ALI PROJECT, SUNSET SWISH and HITOMI. Also accompanied by music that is beautiful, charming and touching. I give it a value of 9 because it sounds beautiful, nice and interesting.\nCharacter:10\nI wouldn't say I have much of a complaint about main characters. CLAMP does a good job to portray their characters well. The characters in this series are rather varied. Some are very plain and one-dimensional, while others have an amazing complexity to them that makes them very life-like. I'll be honest. I've become somewhat infatuated with Lelouch as a character (and am rather biased as a result). To me, he is very much a human character -- he has emotions, opinions, a unique point of view, and some very serious flaws, all of which make him incredibly easy to relate to and to sympathize with. He is easily the most complex character in the series, and he feels real to me, even with his supernatural powers and his genius-level intellect. This ability to make the audience relate to him is also probably the series' greatest strength and the main reason why the story is able to remain relevant and interesting despite the fact that there aren't too many new ideas plotwise. I gave a value of 10 because his character is well illustrated, beautifully, fascinated and amazed. Lelouch is not only the main character, there C.C, Kallen and Suzaku. I will not explain the other characters more.\nEnjoyment/Overall:10/10\nAs little as I felt I delved into the personalities of the characters, I did enjoy the film a lot. I really love this series, and I definitely did not see that happening. Honestly, I found the first episode incredibly underwhelming: the opening sequence made it look like a series I wouldn't be interested in watching at all, and all of the expository really turned me off...but the second episode? That was so much more epic than I could have ever predicted, and I was pretty much won over after that. Everyone's lives diverge in different ways. I enjoyed Lelouch struggles throughout the film to help each other, and a second series of Code Geass was very touching to tears dripping. I gave a value of 10 for the Enjoyment / overall very unusual start, good story, his character is good, the picture is good, the music was good, a battle between robots,  politics, ideology, tension, competition, brotherhood, friendship, happy, sad, love,and hate.\nhow do you guys want?\n        "},
			{["score"]=6, ["helpful"]=6, ["text"]="                          \n    Ah, Code Geass, where do I start? I picked this up because it was in the top twenty when I was browsing and thought, \"Hmm, I haven't watched a mecha anime in ages.\"\nTurns out the anime wasn't much about giant robots anyway.\nIt is (or should've been) about a boy seeking revenge, using both his awesome intellect and a superpower he unexpectedly gained, but somehow the story kept getting derailed. There was an episode about a cat, and another about a school festival. Too much time was spent on a side-character that didn't add much to the plot. \nPart of the problem for me was it\n          \n        felt like popular elements and plotlines from different stories and genres were thrown in and mixed liberally, trying to make sure there's something for everyone. Unfortunately, it mostly ended up with an incohesive, sprawling mess. At certain points of the show it could have easily been a slice-of-life/comedy anime dealing with school life, interspersed with secret phone calls arranging armed takeovers, keeping your secret identity from your best friend while he hides his from you, and all this while hiding your secret girlfriend in your bedroom. The only thing missing is political intrigue, and possibly secret samurais. \nHere's my problem with Lelouch: everyone says he's very intelligent, but there's no real evidence of it. Sure, he does something and his side wins, and everyone goes, \"Ah, that was very clever of him,\" but we really have no idea how the world works for his actions to be smart. The worldbuilding is pretty much non-existent. There's this powerful Holy Brittanian Empire which took over Japan, and presumably most of the known world (but, strangely, not the EU, despite being next-door neighbours). The Empire is a terrible thing because the writers say so. That's it. \nAside from Lelouch, the characters are static, cookie-cutter pieces though they fit their roles well enough — a sweet princess trying her best, a staunch knight, a charming little sister, a mad scientist, a slightly over-the-top student council president. Even in Lelouch, his growth is just a slowly shifting stance: from him not caring at all about the consequences of his actions to caring a little, and even then only when it affects those closest to him. It suits his personality, though; the ends justifies the means to him, as long as he can keep his sister safe and happy. Suzaku gave me a headache; he's full of good intentions and I understand where he's coming from, but he could do with being a little less unbending and start considering other point of views.\nFaults aside, I did enjoy it enough to finish watching the whole series. The animation was fluid and nicely done, and the character designs pretty much what you'd expect from CLAMP. The way they looked a lot like other CLAMP characters threw me off a little  — I kept forgetting Suzaku's name because my mind had immediately labelled him as 'Syaoran'. \nI didn't care much for any of the opening or ending themes, and didn't notice much of the soundtrack. I actually found Lelouch's voice slightly jarring — it sounded too deep, especially when he was in Batman-mode — but it was something that grew on me after a while. \nThe plot, when it actually moved, did take a few interesting and unexpected turns, though I found the whole thing rather melodramatic. I do take issue with the cliffhanger ending — it felt like nothing major had been resolved and the audience is left hanging with no sense of closure.\nObviously I'm late to the party and there's a sequel now I could jump right into, but at the moment I don't feel much like it. Maybe I'm just being snobbish and turning my nose up at the cliffhanger, but I'm sure I'll get to it eventually."},

Yes all anime rip off each other,  specially mecha/space operas,  but this was a little much.\nAlso the mech types are a hybrid of classic 80's mechas and Capped mechas with spears like from Escaflowne (also recomended over this), with a couple special units looking like Evangelion with swords.\nThe anime ends up being half decent, like a show to watch if you really cant find anything else.

			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=11, ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Put quite simply, this is the best anime I've ever watched to date. This is one of only two anime I've given a perfect 10/10 score, and there are multiple well-grounded reasons for that.\nThis anime revolves around a very intelligent 17 year old student named Lelouch who decides to rebel against the tyrannical empire of Britannia that is hell-bent on world domination and the subjugation of the people within its boundaries. From episode one you are deposited in a world full of political chaos and intriguing mysteries. This anime is very easy for most people to get into because it is so different from many\n          \n        anime that exist. In Code Geass, we are presented with a protagonist that primarily uses his intelligence to outwit and win battles against his enemies, while in most anime people have grown used to dim-witted protagonists that win through sheer muscle and strength. Although Lelouch does gain a somewhat overpowered advantage over his opponents, it only works because he is able to use it so creatively and masterfully. Also, the sheer SCOPE of this anime glues the watcher to his/her seat, as this anime involves a GLOBAL struggle. This anime is a very nice mix of a drama, political thriller, school-life, mecha-action, with some romance, philosophy, and psychological elements here and there as well. \nThis series is so good  because it has strengths in a variety of different areas. Often times I will find myself enjoying an anime to a certain degree because I like one or two aspects of it while not enjoying other parts of the series as much. Code Geass is one of the exceptions in the anime I have watched in terms of it excelling in many different categories, thus leading to my enjoyment of the series. \nA huge reason why the series blew me away was the characters.  As mentioned before, Lelouch is a ridiculously smart young man who pulls crazy stunts off to obtain victory. Lelouch, as well as most of the other characters in the series, is a dynamic character that changes over the series according to the fluctuating circumstances caused by his rebellion. We as watchers get to experience the elation, the sadness, the hatred, and many other emotions that Lelouch experiences on his wild journey in the anime. As the series progresses and we find out more about Lelouch's connections with Britannia and about his connections to other characters, we find that Lelouch is an amazing anime character. \nThe anime also provided a master stroke in terms of creating a perfect foil character for Lelouch in Suzaku Kururugi.  Lelouch can be characterized as the master manipulator who prefers to let his careful plans lead him to victory, and has a very flexible/intellectual view on morality while  Suzaku has a much more confrontational personality and has more of a black and white view on morality.  The relationship of these two characters is very complicated and changes constantly as the series goes on, and its very fun to watch these dynamic fluctuations. In a sense, their relationship with each-other serves as a microcosm of the entire series in the sense that they represent the two main opposing sides of the series, although their motivations and allegiances change as the series progresses. \n  As for the other characters, many of them have widely varying personalities along with having believable reasons and back stories that contribute to their actions during the anime. It's very fun to see how Lelouch interacts with  various characters in different ways.  The depth of many of these characters is absolutely amazing. Allegiances change, friendships are broken, formed, broken again, a good friend can become the most vicious of enemies, your lover can turn his/her back on  you at any moment! The anime also does a very good job in showing how these characters react emotionally to traumatic or life-changing events, it makes it very easy for the watcher to care for the characters. The personalities of many of the characters in Code Geass are eventually so fleshed out that you are absolutely devastated if something happens to a character you loved, or you are absolutely elated when some scumbag actually gets what he/she deserves.\nThis anime does have supernatural and science-fiction oriented elements, but these do not detract from the enjoyment of the story. The most notable element, besides the \"advantage\" I will not spoil in this review, would be the gigantic mechs called \"knightmare frames\" that are used in the anime by many characters. Honestly, I just viewed them as what they truly are in the series: tools that are used by groups of people to achieve their goals. In a general sense, you could look at it as people using the currently available technology of their times to achieve their means to an end.. I personally enjoyed the variety in different mechs with their different abilities/functions. If you don't like mecha-focused series like many Gundam  series, that's fine, but it shouldn't be a reason for skipping this series. As for the \"advantage\" that Lelouch has over his opponents, this by no means provides Lelouch an easy and quick path to victory. Lelouch encounters many other characters who's intellects, technology, and powers/abilities rival that of his own, and Lelouch is often times reduced to simply having to think his way out of situations in order to survive them.  Despite the elements mentioned above, this series is very realistic in terms of the consequences of Lelouch's and other people's actions. This is not your typical shonen anime where everyone survives in the end except the bad guys: People from various sides and perspectives die in this anime. People are psychologically traumatized in this anime. People's lives are dramatically changed in this anime. No one is invulnerable, no one is safe! Once you learn this early on in the series, you are always on edge when something big happens because you know the consequences could be extraordinarily dire.  \nPerhaps the element of the series that kept my attention the most was the absolute unpredictability of how events would unfold in the anime, as Code Geass has many twists and turns that always keep you guessing.  Lelouch gets put into so many crazy situations, and many of the outcomes may not even be what you expect from an anime these days. Even when I re-watched the show two years later  I was STILL surprised at some of the things that happened, that's how crazy some of the turns of events are! And these events will be so significant that you will almost certainly have a strong reaction to them because they are done so well. I usually don't react very much while watching anime besides maybe laughing sometimes, but with Code Geass I clapped and yelled my approval at some events, loudly cursed and denounced other events, and actually cried (not kidding) in two very sad moments in the anime because I had become so attached to the characters that died.\nCode Geass is also a great anime because it includes much questioning of philosophy and morality embedded into its story and characters. The actions of the characters make you really question what truly is right and wrong, what is good and evil, where the dividing lines between these categories should actually fall, and makes you question just how much bad should be done to achieve an ultimately good end. The series makes the watcher approach uncomfortable topics like racism and segregation , and forces you to reconcile with the issues as you watch people struggle as a result of these issues.  People that have finished the series constantly debate whether or not this or that should have been done, what was so in so's true motivation, were they right? etc.. etc.. \nLast but not least, animation and visuals. The animation as absolutely gorgeous if you watch this show in 720 or 1080p (recommended in 1080 with a good LED screen to get full enjoyment of the series's visuals). The art style is colorful but tastefully so and not \"cartoon-ish.\" The character designs are from the renown CLAMP studio, so they are absolutely top notch. The only qualm I really had with them is that the body proportions could seem a bit weird at times (some characters seem to have strangely long limbs, but this is not terribly noticeable). Everything from the environments, the mechs, the people, and the action scenes are animated superbly and with a painstaking attention to detail throughout most of the animation. The opening and ending songs are beautiful visually. The CLAMP studio even incorporates original colored drawings of Code Geass characters in the ending songs, which is nice. \nThe audio of this anime is probably the absolute best I've ever approached in any anime I've watched, no contest. There are so many different songs and themes to go with various scenes/circumstances, and they all fit very well. There is such a wide variety of songs that I never felt like any one got overused or got old. The opening and ending songs are amazing, and they sort of reflect the dynamics of the series  itself. Some openings and endings songs are very lighthearted and cheerful, while others are energetic and dramatic, while still others are dark and mysterious sounding. The first opening and ending really capture your attention, among others. I loved the fact that the first ending was dark and mysterious, and the second ending was so lighthearted and fun! I watched the series twice, the first time in the English Dub and the second time in the original Japanese. In my opinion, the English voices are good, especially with  the renown and experienced Johnny Young Bosch voicing Lelouch very well. HOWEVER, the Japanese original is better in my opinion. In particular the character of Zero and the Charles Zi Britannia are absolutely phenomenal in Japanese as they have very unique voices, but much of their auditory impact is lost upon the English version. \nI could keep ranting about how good Code Geass is, but I will end my review here. Ultimately, this show is an absolute must watch for any anime fan. You should watch it just for the crazy unpredictable ride that you will go on as you progress through the series and for the amazingly awesome story, if for thing else! \n*Note: If you watch the series, I'd advise you to not watch it on youtube, as that website is a breeding ground for spoilers!  \n"},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=11, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I would actually go as far as to say that there is more depth and mind behind Code Geass than the grand Death Note. There's much more going on, lots of loose ends and many ideals and opinions displayed. There are a bunch of different messages for the viewer to comprehend, and the more I think about it the more complex it gets. Plus, there are some excellent twists and turns throughout the story and many of them lead somewhere, although at first the seemed like a bad idea. \nAnd for once in an anime, the female characters are more than (although still a bit)\n          \n        eye-candy with over dimensioned body parts. C.C's personality is more cynical and introvert than any other I've seen in animes. She's so far from the standard cuddly, high pitched and gullible girls we are used to. \nShirley, which at first seems like your standard dumb schoolgirl evolves and shows more character than I could have ever hoped for. \nMilly Ashford have such a warm and friendly attitude but with a certain amount of seriousness and thoughtfulness. I could go on about all of them, but I'll just wrap up the ladies by stating that Cornelia is one of the most bad-ass women you'll ever see in any series. \nAs for the men, well, where to begin? Without mentioning any names or such, the story of the main characters manages to portray a very moving journey, which begins reasonable and down to earth but eventually fades away into damnation and madness.\nAt the end of the series I found myself in favour of no one, just baffled over the splendid story about power, corruption and love. \nI could go on forever about certain events or characters but the fact is that I would just be scratching the surface of what Code Geass has to offer.  If you are in for a serious and clever anime, then this is the one for you.\n"},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=11, ["text"]="                          \n    Code Geass is an anime I've come to like a lot, while before watching it (and even while watching it at times) I was skeptical of it. The majority of the anime is certainly a good show, with some great episodes/moments, but not really more than a good show. However, for the last ten or so episodes, the show really shines, moving at a breakneck pace with many plot twists (some aren't all that great, but just the scale of them makes them at least a little interesting), and an increase in action.\nThe story is pretty interesting, outcast prince turned genius high school student acquires\n          \n        a supernatural power, completing the set of tools he needs to put his plan to take down the Britannian empire and allow his little sister to live a happier life, is opposed by childhood friend: a member of the Britannian military.\nThere are some less interesting parts, mostly towards the beginning of the show, focusing more on Lelouche's high school life and that of the school's student council, often dealing with romance and other more petty matters, although the main storyline usually either interrupts these scenes or has a small part in them. These scenes are pretty much required for Code Geass to progress, but that doesn't make them more appealing. It is interesting, however, to see Lelouche in this environment, where he is generally kindhearted, as opposed to his sometimes-evil, vengeful personality that he takes on as Zero.\nThe art is nicely detailed and colorful, the backgrounds are great, as are the Nightmares and their accompanying action scenes. However, the character design just doesn't fly with me. Even after watching 25 episodes, I still cringe on the inside whenever a character is shown from a side view. Nearly everyone is very thin, many have ridiculous hairstyles and the eyes are huge with too much detail on the iris (which is the case with most anime, but that doesn't make it any better here. Especially with the hair, some of it is plain stupid).\nThe sound is one of the weaker points, but still well done. The first opening theme is very catchy, however the other two are decent at best. I hardly remember anything about the music in the show, other than those high-pitched cooings over orchestral pieces, usually a mellow one at the beginning of the show or a slow but fitting one for some of the dramatic ending scenes. \"High pitched cooing over orchestral pieces\" may be an entirely inaccurate description, I really don't remember much about this show's music. Which I have to take as a flaw.\nThe characters...Well, there's a lot of them. You have the royal family, the high school students, the Britannian military force, the Black Knights, and a few more. The story is actually a little hard to follow at times due to all these characters. I'm sure there's been times where I didn't grasp the importance of a certain scene because I forgot about what was going on with a certain character, or set of characters. I also forget many of the characters' names, and a lot of the time I'm not sure who someone's talking about when they mention a name.\nBut focusing on quality opposed to quantity, the characters have a nice variety, and a few are especially well done. Lelouche in particular is a great character. He is well developed throughout the show, questioning his actions at times (since everyone loves to compare this to Death Note, I'll point out a difference here - I'm glad the show did this, in Death Note Light questioned his plans exactly once: when he first got them, while Code Geass puts a focus on Lelouche's morals regarding him murdering in a few episodes). Suzaku, while a good character, is not one I find especially interesting, he's rather straightforward. Oh, and I know he's in the military and all...But some of his little physical stunts are completely unbelievable. Among the others, we have some annoying ones (Nina [Oh God, Nina in particular], Mao, Lloyd [Use a different tone every once in awhile buddy], and a couple others). C.C is a very interesting character, obviously helped by our lack of knowledge about her past and her mysterious powers and such, but aside from all that she has an enjoyable personality and is fun to watch. Kallen is also a highlight, her inner strength and loyalty is always entertaining.\nOh, and on a less important note, I want to mention Diethard. He's not a bad character...But on the surface there's just tons of little bad choices made with this character. First of all, if you don't think of the word \"retard\" every time his name is said, I applaud you for being more mature than me. His hair wins the most ridiculous award for the show, and his very deep yet perfectly clear voice doesn't fit at all to me. Anyway...\nThis is a very enjoyable show, it's very action packed and filled with dramatic (sometimes overly so) moments. There are a lot of things about this show that mildly annoy me, however they are things that for the most part apply to anime in general, and since this is an anime site I doubt my sentiments are ones that many will have. Anyway, the sub-plots can be entertaining at times but don't take a backseat to the main story as much as I'd like. Overall though, it can be a little confusing at times but Code Geass is a show that's pretty much all about the enjoyment factor, and it succeeds for the most part, however it does a much better job on the last ten or so episodes than the first 15.\nOverall, Code Geass is an all-around good show that doesn't really have any major flaws. Your interest in it may fluctuate a little, you'll be much more eager to watch the next episode after a Nightmare battle and a plot twist than seeing a little high school drama, but even in the less captivating episodes the show never dips below decent.\n        "},

The only big downer is that the action is a bit boring to watch. In hindsight to having finished the series, everything that the author includes in the story is pretty important. I would say that even the episodes that seem like fillers aren't really fillers. \nIn terms of the story, it's pretty straightforward, but as the show goes on, the many mysteries and cliffhangers keep the story intense and open to many possibilities. As a result\n          \n        of the cliffhangers, something big happens every episode (maybe after the first 3 episodes after the plot is established), which gives this anime the perfect pace (in my opinion), an anime should have.\nThough it may seem boring at first, I'd recommend you watch at least 3-5 episodes before making a judgement.

Japan is now referred to as Area 11, and its people the 11's. A Britannian who was living in Japan at the time, Lelouch, vowed to his Japanese friend Suzaku that he'd destroy Britannia.

While Suzaku is secretly made the pilot of Britannia's brand new prototype Knightmare, Lancelot, Lelouch becomes the masked Zero to lead the rebellion to destroy Britannia once and for all.\n(From Anime News Network)\nPersonal Opinion\nWhen watching this series I immediately noticed similarities to 3 other animes i've watched. However, Code Geass surpasses two of them and matches the third in quality. So here is the list of the three similar animes and my comparisons\n- Death Note\nThis was the most apparent one early on. In Death Note, Light gains the power to kill anyone w/ no trace left behind... he uses this ability to make a utopia which he can be a god over. In Code Geass, Lelouch gains the ability of persuasion and uses this ability to attempt to overthrow the Brittanian government. Both Light and Lelouch are manipulative and show no remorse by the end of the series.\nAs for differences. Almost nothing could surprise Light in Death Note... Lelouch was suprised frequently throughout Code Geass. Death Note dealt with 1 or 2 key character interactions... Code Geass deals w/ many more. Light appeared almost inhuman in Death Note at a few points... showing no emotions or regret... Lelouch actually shows some understanding of what he is doing and at times... appears weak.\nIndeed Code Geass succeeds whens Death Note fails. CG expanded the battle of intellect while managing to appeal to action fans with intense non-disorienting fights. The character interactions in CG take it to another level... which leads to anime similarity #2\n- Gundam SEED\nThe usage of Mecha, and two childhood friends reuniting on opposite sides of the battlefield. Those were the first major similarities to SEED. But other then that... towards the second half of the series, the themes of 'war is evil' starts to emerge... and you start to sympathize and criticize both sides.\nIn differences, SEED... although bleak at times... always showed hope for a bright outcome... Code Geass starts off dark... gets darker... teases us w/ happy ending... before crushing all chances and becoming pitch black. CG is incredibly tragic... with episode 22-23 almost bringing me to tears (if you know me... you know that this is rare).\nAs for why Code Geass is better... well the simple answer is that it expanded when SEED didn't... the same reason i stated w/ Death Note.\nNow for the show it matched...\n- Eureka Seven\nThe similarities in this case aren't in the plot and characters... rather aesthetics. Instead of sky surfing mechs, we had roller-blading ones (no joke... but it's still quite cool). The military Knightmare Frames (the name of the mechs in Code Geass) had similar coloring and design to the KLFs of E7. The main mech in series, the Lancelot, had a similar design to the main mech of E7, the 'Nirvash' typeZERO. This can be explained due to the fact that the writer of Code Geass was the writer of Eureka Seven. On an unrelated note... the first opening for CG was made by the same artist who made he first opening for E7. (=P)\nAs for differences... way too many to list...\nIn fact... that's why I can't name a better of the two. Both are excellent in their own right but are too different to be compared. Eureka Seven was beautiful... Code Geass was awesome. There's a difference.\nThe ending of Code Geass is such a cliffhanger that it's obvious that there'll be a sequel series... indeed it's confirmed. Code Geass; Lelouch of the Rebellion R2 is set for release in Spring 08 (coinciding w/ it's first season release on Adult Swim). I look forward to finding out what happened, and how the plot advances...\n9/10\nSimilar to...\nStated above\n        "},

			{["score"]=7, ["helpful"]=10, ["text"]="\n                          \n    Fortunately it is coming a new season soon, it is fortunate because this show has a lot of potential, unfortuneately they aren't close to that in the first season.\nI was really looking forward to watching this show, after what I could see of reccomendations, this should be close to two of my favourite animes Death Note and FMP. I was so-so pleased after the first episodes, but I expected it to grow on me when I got closer to the plot and a grand finaly. I expected right, to some degree. \nIt was entertaining and the art is great, and even if the story is\n          \n        not spectacular and fantastic in any way, but it is good and takes up some ethical problems. The story is shifting swiftly between the battles, and the fast switching is one of its strenghts, but also one of it weaknesses.\nThe swift switching in enviroment and action/school does not suit the characters very well. Because of the switching you don't get to know many of the characters very well .After the show you won't know that much about Karen, the chairman, Nina and Leval. Besides even though the scenes switch swiftly the main story moves pretty slow and can become irritating some times. \nThe first OP is not good at all, and the song there is just terrible, the second one fits the show much better, but the bad OP drags down the sound-score for me.\nFor a conclusion this show was between a 7 and a 8 for me, but I gave it an 8 as my score on my list, so I'll give it a 7 here. The show had the potential to evolve more, it has a lot of lay-ups to make a fun part with schoolife aswell, but insted focuses everything on the action part. I think this could have been done better if they had builded it up like FMP have. But people that liked FMP will definately like this one to, \n        "},

The strength of this anime as I perceive it is related to the fact that it is able to represent a dystopian future with super powers and mechs in such a realistic way. As the story develops you find yourself truly invested both in the individual struggles of the different characters, and the struggle represented by the plot as a whole. The struggle isn't simple and straight forward, but rather complex. This is\n          \n        one of the few anime in which a viewer will truly struggle with the many characters' decisions morally because there is no clear correct decision. Definitely worth a watch.\nThe art is great, almost flawless in fact...\nCharacters are developed to extent that one can hardly believe, especially considering how long the series is.\nThe mood of the story is a serious and dark one, so prepare for an emotional roller coaster.\nThis is an anime for those looking for something dark and serious with a attention grabbing story and in depth character interaction. Just watch it at some point, you won't regret it!"},
			{["score"]=7, ["helpful"]=10, ["text"]="                          \n    \"Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch\", the highly received production by Sunrise, directed and created by Goro Taniguchi, is quite a unique venture into political anime.\nCode Geass tries its best to surprise you with its twists and turns, even to the point of it twisting so many times it practically breaks its back.\nLelouch is the anti-hero in Code Geass, doing all the wrong things with good intentions. Lelouch and his gained power \"Geass\", reminded me of Light in \"Death Note\", which was released the same year as Code Geass. But that comparison falls once the show starts rolling, and that didn't happen until around the 13th\n          \n        episode. The rest of the story (including the second season) is a bunch of twists, turns, stabs, jabs, and u-turns.\nOne of the main problems I have with this series is that there is so much information in each episode that it was hard to keep up at times.\nAnd for some reason, I did not find most of the episodes to be very memorable. Whenever I watched an episode, I had a hard time remembering what happened without looking up the synopsis of the particular episode.\nI found this out in the time that I've watched/read anime, movie's, books, ect. That there can be so much drama and so many twists in such a short time, that one becomes basically numb to it, and new twists are not as surprising as they could have been in a much more controlled series.\nNot to say that this series is boring, it's actually an intelligent portrayal of two empires at war, and all the twists are quite imaginative. It's fun to see how this series goes down, and by the time I was finished watching the first season, I was excited to watch the second season.\nJust about every character plays an important role in the show, whether they are intelligently implemented or there to be the annoying twist creator can be hard to decipher, but just about every character is either of these two.\nLelouch Lamperouge is the brains of the series (Literally, he can barely do a 100 Meter dash without stopping in the middle, out of breath.), he obtains an ancient power called \"Geass\". With his new power, he is inspired to take revenge on his father, the emperor of Britania who abandoned Lelouch, and create a world where his sister Nunally can live in peace.\nSuzaku Kururugi is Lelouch's childhood friend. He's very important to this story, regarding Lelouch.\nC.C. is a being who was discovered somewhere and locked in a capsule, has the power to grant Geass to whoever is worthy.\nKallen Stadtfeld, Milly Ashford, Rivalz Cardemonde, Nina Einstein, and Shirley Fenette are all Lelouch's close friends, and apart of the student council at Ashford Academy, Milly Ashford is the president.\nThere are many other side characters that will come into the loop as well.\nThe art is very well done. I must note that there's quite an abundance of ecchi in both of the series, one instance frontal nudity. \nThe fights can be dramatic and epic, and the animation never seems to drop noticeably in quality.\nThe music is very well done, and gives off that Dictator and Monarchy vibe quite well.\nThe Seiyuu are excellent, they're never out of character.\nThe SFX also fit very well.\n---\nThis is a series that deserves its recognition to an extent. It is imaginative when it comes to the politics of this series, creative in its delivery, and fun to watch. \nYou may even want to watch it just because everyone is so in love with the series, it would be nice to know what people are talking about.\nIf you are interested in a show with many twists and turns, and are not bothered by the comparisons to Death Note, Gundam, & Legend of the Galactic Heroes, go ahead and watch this fun series, you will love it.\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=10, ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Watching a movie or TV show is sort of like reading a book: the plot must capture your attention, the dialogue must be captivating, the characters must develop, and an overall picture must at first be obscure, only to become more clear as the story progresses. Code Geass does this and so much more, taking science fiction, romance, action, mecha and character and plot development onto an interstellar level. This was one of the only anime I've watched where I had to sit back and reflect: what the HECK just happened? \nThe story was just excellent. The political infighting, friend bickering, resistance fighting, romantic spin\n          \n        and serious hardcore action melded perfectly from the start. The story delves headfirst, without a lengthy intro, and continues at a an increasingly faster pace. The \"geass\" is revealed early in the show, and it twists the plot this way and that. The last couple of episodes had me gripping my seat, biting my nails, twisting my hands - anything to get the nervousness out of my system. Suspenseful and fast-paced and sprinkled with betrayal and common themes of life, Code Geass starts off light but becomes very heavily serious with plot twist after plot twist. It quickly became very dark and foreboding. I found myself walking away, shaking my head; it was too hard not to simply watch in one sitting.\nThe visuals are stunning, to say the least. The characters are drawn tall and lanky, with stereotypical straight hair. The backdrops are gorgeous, the environment drawn to the exact detail, the battles are, ahem, FREAKING AWESOME. There really is no other term; being a fan of action, this satiated my taste for some good ol' shoot em' up action flick. The anime did NOT skimp out on any scene.\nThe sound was merely enjoyable; the OP and ED were nothing special until the second half of the season. There, it really picked up. I never did notice the background music; it never left a lasting impression. Then again, I was probably so absorbed into what was unfolding story-wise that I forgot to notice something as trivial as background music....however, the music did fit the mood when I happened to notice it, and there was always some sort fast-paced beat during the epic scenes, so it all works out.\nLastly, the characters: a huge hit. There was the character for everyone, the tough guy, the strategist, the morally \"right\" guy. But the way these characters interacted within the bigger context of the Code Geass world: priceless. The way the government was portrayed sounded faintly similar to the British government during the American Revolution; I'll keep it at that. Each character changed and developed, and the main character probably experienced every emotion in the book at some point. Emotions flowed freely: romance, pain, grief, love, betrayal - they were all shown, in exquisite detail, from a variety of characters. It was refreshing to see human characteristics; many anime tend to sort of skip of the ramifications of certain actions, leading to a dull storyline. Code Geass, however, takes it a step further and actually shows what happens to the human condition when we experience major loss, grief, or anger.\nOverall, this anime was probably one of the best I've ever seen. At the end, it does leave you hanging; however, the way they set it up shows that the second season won't be disappointing either. The excellently portrayed characters mixed with a few ingredients of epic sound and stunning visuals all in a larger pot of a heart-stopping story leads to a dinner of the gods. Watch the anime; at least give the first couple of episodes a shot. I'll make a contract with C.C. because you won't be disappointed. \n        "},

I've met a few people who will argue Code Geass is just a copy of Death Note, but while I am a fan of both i'd easily say Lelouch is definitely more appealing of a character then Light, because Light was given power, but easily corrupted by it.\nI'd also have to say the plot was absolutely amazing. I don't remember a single time in the fifty\n          \n        episodes I got bored of it. I'm not even a mecha fan and I actually try to stay away from all mecha series after Gundam, but the mechas in this anime are actually pretty good.\nThe art was also great. The character design combined with background visuals is  complete sex to the eye, and I remember watching these episodes and admiring the detailed art that was put in. Animation is also great, there is some limited animation when developing the story of the characters, as with all animes, but the mecha fights make up for it.\nThe songs in this anime were fantastic. I haven't watched Code Geass in two months and I can still remember at least five of the soundtracks played. All the soundtracks are memorable in some way and are played in times most fitting of the scene.\nI enjoyed the hell out of this anime, it has the elements of slice of life, comedy, adventure, action, and drama, seriously, in this anime there is at least some parts that will appeal to your side of the audience. Personally I enjoy all of those elements which is why my ratings are so high for this anime.\n\nOverall, Code geass is an anime you should definitely give a try. The story is interesting, the art value is astronomically high, the soundtracks are memorable, and the characters are by latest anime standards, gods. Treasure the first time you watch this anime, because it is one of the very few gems in a swamp.\n\nStory: 10\nArt: 9\nSound: 9\nCharacter: 10\nEnjoyment: 10\nOverall: 10\n        "},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=10, ["text"]="\n                          \n    To be completely honest, I was unsure of Code Geass.  The story seemed unoriginal and at first felt like something we've all seen before.  With that aside however, I decided to watch a cuple of episodes to get my own opinion on the series.   When it aired on adult swim I found the story too move too slow for my liking (1 episode a week with only a few developments in one episode) so I decided to watch all of the fansubs at once to get my code geass fix.  It wasn't long before I was completely hooked on it.\nTo\n          \n        put it briefly, Code Geass is about the prince of Brittannia, Lelouche, who lost his mother and is unhappy with the rule that Brittania imposes upon the world.  Brittannia is a large empire spanning around 67 percent world, but when it catures a country it colonizes it and makes it part of its growing empire.  The story focuses on Area 11, otherwise known as Japan.  The date is 2017, seven years after Brittannia defeated Japan.\nLelouche meets strange girl, C.C., who gives him a strange a supernatural pwer:  The power of the geass.  The geass allows Lelouche to control the actions of people around him when he looks directly into their eyes.  Using this strange and cruel power, Lelouche declares war on Brittannia, promising the people of Japan freedom from the rule of Brittania.\nSTORY: 9\nThis anime does not disappoint.  The story, though sluggish at times, was great, especially during some of the mecha battles (there are lots of them) and where Lelouch plans his strategy.  There is a lot (and I repeat, A LOT) of action, and mecha battles too.  The story goes deep into the actions of Brittania and Zero's actions.  These is a hint of the supernatual and romance in this anime.\nART: 9\nThe art is top notch, though it cannot compare to some of the animes of late.  Despite the fact that the majority of episodes I watched were fansubs, the few episodes I watched on english TV had excellent animation.  The mecha battles are intense and Code Geass does a great job of animating them.\nSOUND: 8\nI loved the japanese voice actors, and the SFX were also on par, but unfortunately the english dubs were slightly disappointing.  Hence the 8/10.\nCHARACTER: 10\nThis is where Code Geass shines the most.  You will be touched by the actions of some the characters, while others will ake you despise them.  The character development was excellent, probably the best I've seen in an action anime of this caliber.\nENJOYMENT: 9\nTHIS ANIME IS ADDICTING.  The story moves at a slow enough pace for you to savor it, constantly wanting more.  The characters will make you smile, laugh, cry, and loathe.  The action wll keep you at the edge of your seat.  This anime isn't very re-watchable, since most of the njoyment comes from the suspense, however.  Another good suggestion for this anime is to never skip ahead, or you will be lost and you will probably have the storyline ruined in the process of watching it.\nI give Code Geass (and Code Geass R2) a nine out of ten.  This show is great.  Keep up the good work, Sunrise!\n        "},
			{["score"]=6, ["helpful"]=10, ["text"]="                          \n    Last week, while I was browsing the Internet for new anime to download, I just realise something was amiss... What's with Code Geass : R2? Then it hit me. This is the new installment (part 2) of Code Geass series. Funny, though. I have the first series at home; Code Geass : Lelouch of the Rebellion but I haven't managed to finish watching the whole episodes. I guess because it bores me to death!\nThis is a sci-fi themed anime and it was produced by CLAMP. The plot is rather so-so. But the primary reason why I don't fancy this anime is because the theme. Gosh!\n          \n        For an anime, I believe the theme is rather serious, too serious in fact. It's too 'political' for me. And, even though most animes like to manipulate exaggeration but the idea that this anime is portraying is rather far-fetched (just because I don't fancy it)!\nThe anime takes place somewhere in the future in the alternate universe. In that world, Japan is invaded by The Holy Empire of Britannia. Then, Japan is given a brand new name : Area 11. The country then is shared by the citizen of Britannia as well as the original Japanese who are referred as the elevens.\nSo, what on earth is GEASS? Well, according to the anime, geass is the power to manipulate people's minds. It is represented by a glowing, bird-shaped symbol in the iris. This power is bestowed upon Lelouch Lamperouge by a mysterious green-haired girl named C.C. Who is she? Well, you have to watch it, if you wanna know more. With the new-found power, he finally has the means to defeat Britannia and fulfill his two wishes: to seek revenge for his mother and to construct a new world in which his beloved sister, Nannaly can live happily.\nThis anime also features the extensive use of mechas weaponry. The mechas are known as Knightmare Frame. Lelouch's childhood friend and son of Japan's last prime minister, Kururugi Suzaku is in the service of the Britannia Army as a soldier, and was chosen to test an experiment new model of Knightmare Frame, the Lancelot.\nThis anime exudes the theme of survival and sacrifice. It also tells us that revenge is sweet however too much revenge can be detrimental! Overall, this anime is OK. But I don't really fancy it, period!"},

Not because he wants to control the world, not because he's trying to avenge his parents or girlfriend or dog, he's just bad because he's got nothing better to do with his life.

Then Code Geass is the anime for you.\nCode Geass is very visually appealing, and the alternate universe setting is intriguing. Unfortunately these are squandered by melodramatic writing and obnoxious characters. The chief offender is Lelouch, the protagonist himself, who is one of those holier-than-thou genius characters with beautiful eyes and a tragic backstory. C.C., the geas-giver, is a prime example of women as plot devices; and Nunnally, Lelouch's poor little blind sister, is like a throwback to the uselessly delicate girls\n          \n        of Victorian literature. Even Kallen, supposedly a strong female character, is the frequent subject of the male gaze, and furthermore cannot help herself from falling in love with Lelouch, who is a heartless cardboard cutout whose one redeeming feature is his fashion sense.\nThis is a show where nothing good ever really happens. I watched half the season and felt that anything this show was trying to make me feel was not worth feeling.

Even if there is a clash between different factions and you follow actions on the battlefield, you'll still know whom is fighting whom. The characters are played well, the acting is good, the voices sound well, and the\n          \n        lines are well thought of. The story is set in the future with a lot of elements not present in our time, however they work well in the story, you get to know when given elements are developed, how they are used, and in what respect some are different than others( it sounds vague but im doing my best to explain without spoilers.) the story has a lot of plot twists aswell, and usually a given action has impact on other characters aswell.

Aside the point, Code Geass does a great job of getting to the storyline quickly, and  I would say by episode 3 or 4 you'll be hooked in. Be prepared for the insane amount of plot twists and hiffclangers :p.  At the end of episodes youll be burning to find out what happens next.  In short, the story does a great job of putting you on edge, so be sure to\n          \n        expect some gnarly plot twists.  \nArt:  The art style of Code Geass took a little getting used to, especially since I have watched several anime that feather in gorgeous work.  The characters are considerably taller then what I am used to in animes like Full Metal Alchemist or Attack on Titan. The art style reminds me more of an art style like Ouran High School Host club, but less colorful.  To keep it in simple terms, the art style is a little different, but it grew on me.  \nSound:  The sound in the anime is average, and since I do love my anime intros and endings, Code Geass only delivered  1 or 2 solid intros in the span of the show.  Quite honestly, there were a few openings that were pretty bad, probably around episode 16ish.  Sound effects were fine, as most animes usually are.  Not particularly picky in that regard.  \nCharacter:  Probably the main reason why the show is phenomenal.  Every character has a specific trait about them that attaches you.  As a top 10 tier 1 anime, it does not dissapoint in its character development.  One of my favorite characters in the anime isn't even human, hes a cat! I wont tell you its name because its the best name for a cat ever lol.  \nEnjoyment:  I was overjoyed watching this anime.  Its the kind of feeling that once you hit a good episode you automatically become addicted and start binge watching.  For me i watched Season 1 in about a week, and Season 2 within a day XD.  Binge watching season 2 was a bad decision, and most certainly was not a good way to spend my time.  However this was one of those shows that really deserves it.  \nOverall:  This anime is fantastic.  The only way you could hate this anime is if you were strictly against mecha anime.  Honestly, even if you dislike mecha anime (since it is an overused theme) you will probably still enjoy watching CG, and by not tuning in you're missing out.  This anime is now a personal favorite of mine, and I highly recommend it  if you couldn't already tell by the language of my review :).  Put it on your anime bucket list if you will :)), and also stream it on animehaven.org for the dub/sub.\n\n"},
			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=4, ["text"]="                          \n    Alternate histories are a very peculiar genre, one which I quite like. As someone who enjoys history and politics in general, it is quite entertaining to imagine how real-life events would turn out differently, and to what extent fiction diverges from reality. In AH circles, there is a term known as the \"POD\" or \"Point of Divergence.\" Fiction correlates from reality in a fairly coherent manner up until this point. To what extent history changes depends on the writer. Some series such as Bioshock and Wolfenstein drastically diverge from real life events, explaining divergences with quantum mechanics (Bioshock) or advanced technology (Wolfenstein). Using a non-videogame\n          \n        example, writer Harry Turtledove adopts a similar approach to alternate history. One of his most famous novels is \"The Guns of the South.\" In it, an South African extremist organization known as the Afrikaner Weerstandbeweging (a real-life white supremacist faction) utilize time-travel to provide the Confederacy with modern assault rifles. While this is a very silly premise, the ramifications of modern AK-47s in the 19th century are portrayed very realistically. This is something shared by all 3 IPs. \nCode Geass on the other hand, takes an entirely different approach to alternate history. \nThe POD begins with the Celts fending off the Romans from the British Isles. British history goes quite well, with Elizabeth I later siring male heirs to the throne. However, the primary POD is the failure of the American Revolution, otherwise known as \"Washington's Rebellion\" in-universe. The USA never existed (thanks to Benjamin Franklin betraying the real-life Founding Fathers), leaving Britain as the supreme military power. French autocrat Napoleon Bonaparte kicked out the British from Europe, resulting them in conquering all of North America and South America. Meanwhile, Napoleon establishes a pseudo-European Union composed of Europe and Africa, with a smaller ambiguous Middle Eastern nation surviving. China manages to gain immense foothold in contrast to Japan, wherein China conquers most of East Asia. Since Commodore Perry never established contact between America and Japan in the 1800s, this left Britain (now called Britannia) to establish relations. And by \"establish relations,\" I mean invade Japan to exploit it's own natural resources and people for Britannia's own benefit. When the series starts, Japan has undergone Britannian colonization, with systematic attempts by the Britannians to wipe out Japanese culture by means of racial segregation and social darwinism. As the opening narration states, the very name of Japan itself is stripped down to a mere number: Area 11. \nEnter our protagonist Lelouch Lamperouge, formerly known as Lelouch vi Britannia. One of the former Britannian princes, his mother was tragically murdered during the Britannian invasion of Japan. Seeking revenge, he calls out his father, the social darwinist Charles zi Britannia. Clearly not in the mood to provide answers, Charles discards Lelouch's demands. Lelouch goes into exile as a student in a affluent Britannian school. In the years following the Britannian occupation, Lelouch gets caught up in a firefight between Japanese nationalists and the Britannian government. During this skirmish, he comes into contact with a mysterious yet beautiful woman known as CC. In a Faustian bargain, CC grants Lelouch with the power of Geass. Geass allows Lelouch to instantly command someone to do anything, but it can only be used once. With a newfound power and his natural charisma and intelligence, Lelouch vi Britannia begins to form his own organization known as the Black Knights, who on the surface seek independence from Britannia. However, this serves as a personal cover for Lelouch, who is using this nationalist rebellion for two goals: To find out who murdered his mother, and to create a world where he and his disabled sister Nunally can live in peace and happiness. Unfortunately, not only does Lelouch have to contend with the indomitable might of a massive empire, he also must contend with one of their soldiers: Suzaku Kururugi, a former friend of Lelouch who despite his Japanese ethnicity had managed to climb the ranks of the Britannian military, to the point where he even gets his own exclusive mecha (known as a Knightmare Frame in-universe). He serves as an effective and fitting foil to Lelouch. Suzuaku is very defined by the means rather than the end. He wishes to change the system from within, appearing as an honorable person. This is despite the fact that the very system he works for has little regard towards him. Lelouch is defined by the ends. He seeks peace for Nunally and the absolution of his mother's murder. How he does that does not matter, no matter how awful the methods are. Nietzsche would be very proud. \nThere is a lot of conflict in Code Geass, and most of it is good conflict, echoing different themes that are rife for character development and potential. Self vs Society is the primary one, with Lelouch seeking to change the world for his own benefit, which is a mighty task given how he is facing against the power of a multi-continnental superpower. Since he cannot win with raw power, he uses pragmatic tactics to get his way. Whether it be bargaining, terrain destruction, usage of moles in the Britannian government, or bombings, Lelouch plays very dirty. This allows him to show off brilliant, if at times preposterous strategies. Combine that with intense mecha action, and Code Geass is a very entertaining show. Even at it's lowest points, it is impossible not to be bored by the action. \nHowever, there are issues with cohesiveness, which I mentioned previously. One of the issues is the conflict between Britannia and Japan, and how the society in-universe is depicted. Britannia appears to be a mish-mash of several different real-life powers. The racial segregation and discrimmination eerily reminds me of Apartheid South Africa, where the white minority persecuted the Bantu majority by means of segregation. The Bantu people were forced to live in what was known as \"Bantustan.\" Unfortunately, Bantustan became a hotbed for poverty and poor living conditions, along with being denied political power. At the same time however, this is also what various colonial powers did as well. Belgium for example was infamous for their treatment of the Congolese people, as gruesomely described in Joseph Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness.\" The very same novel that also inspired \"Apocalypse Now\" and \"Spec Ops: The Line.\" The social darwinism and militaristic attitudes espoused by the government while echoing Nazi Germany, also were traits characterized by the real-life British Empire during the 1800s. It is clear that the Britannians have an identity. Unfortunately, that identity is one based on discrimination and autocracy. The self does not matter in Britannia. In Bioshock, there was a quote from the main villain Andrew Ryan: \"A man chooses. A slave obeys.\" In Britannia, everyone is a slave, unable to express their own political and social independence. \nThe issue I have is that the Japanese nationalists are not necessarily contrasted well with the Britannians. In Code Geass, the Black Knights embody freedom from foreign powers and personal choice. While they can use unethical tactics, they are much less amoral than the Britannians that they are fighting against. The only problem is that their expressions of freedom would not have been very characteristic of that era. If you look at the actions of Imperial Japan, they were little different themselves from the Europeans they claimed they were rebelling against. Rape, cannibalism, wholesome slaughter of innocent civilians, forced labor and the like were quite common during Imperial Japan's expansion. \nOf course, given how Japan in this timeline is the colonized nation, we wouldn't see institutional atrocities by means of the Japanese. That is the role that the Britannians fill. However, the Japanese resistance movement displays very little fanaticism. Yes, they are terrorist groups. However, we do not see nearly the same amount of fanaticism that is displayed in the Britannians. We do not see very much of their culture expressed, even on an underground level. And the occasional usage of the Rising Sun flag does not necessarily count. Even the Black Knights themselves are relatively benevolent (for an armed resistance), not needlessly killing civilians for the sake of sadism. These groups have an identity (Japanese), but we do not see it expressed very often. This makes the attempt of playing the two groups as foils for one another (an allegory for Lelouch and Suzaku) a little half-hearted. \nWhy is this an issue in the first place? Simple. The show clearly wants us to question morality and how justified the actions of the various factions are, particularly the Black Knights. As mentioned before however, the Black Knights are relatively tame. They can be very underhanded at times, but the Britannians come off as the clear villains and moral aggressors. Even though the USA has a very distinct culture from the UK, the UK still had a considerable influence on the US. As such, both nations share similar values among one another.\n What registers as awful to a British person would equally register as awful as a American. Japan on the other hand has an entirely different culture, one that values the whole rather than the individual. This is how a lot of other East Asian nations operate as well. Some of the IJA soldiers in real life did the things they did for a number of reasons, one of which was the immense societal pressure placed on them. Disobedience would be a fate worse than death. This is shown in Clint Eastwood's \"Letters from Iwo Jima,\" depicting how the societal pressures of the IJA cause much of the conflict in the film while also highlighting how both the US and Japanese have good qualities and negative qualities. This is from the same man who filmed American Sniper, a film criticized by many as a glorification of war. These were otherwise decent people being forced to do terrible things by the society that they lived in. In Code Geass, the Japanese are the opposite. They resemble Americans if anything else, given how more individualistically minded the Americans are in contrast to the Japanese in real life. It is an inaccurate representation of Japanese culture as a result, and it is a shame that the resistance isn't shown to be as bad as the Britannians. Because were that the case, that would incentivize a genuine moral question: Why support the resistance when they are just as bad as the oppressors? In other words, the chance to draw a meaningful comparison or moral equivalency is lost. The anti-war message loses weight when the Black Knights maintain a moral high ground compared to the Britannian government. \nPerhaps the largest issue of them all has to be the school element to it all. I can understand why it was put into place. The general light-hearted school environment is generally meant to give the viewer a break from all the grit and violence of warfare, allowing the audience as a result to relax. But it does not tonally fit into Code Geass. If it is trying to tell a war story, let it tell a war story. It seems somewhat implausible how Lelouch can be both a charismatic leader and a intelligent student at the same time. When these segments happen, it feels like I am in an entirely different show entirely. Mechas and war is a good combination. The whole point of the mecha genre is to put two opposing groups or ideas and pit them against each other by means of allegorical giant robots. A serious war story mixed in with a light-hearted school setting is not fitting. \nCode Geass is still a really great show however. While I have issues with the thematics and the setting, the characters are all well-developed enough and interesting, and Lelouch in particular is a joy to watch, being a fusion of the charisma of Char Aznable with the flair of V from V for Vendetta. It does not end on a conclusive note, but the second-season manages to remedy that problem. There are some flaws that hold it back, but it is nonetheless still a good fun romp. "},
			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=4, ["text"]="                          \n    Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion is a masterpiece not for a few select things that it does uniquely; but rather, for doing everything it attempts to do so phenomenally. Any emotion it wants to convey, it does so with so much conviction that you often find yourself fully engulfed and immersed in the series. This is the remarkably more impressive considering the absurd dystopian, mecha, science fiction (with magic) setting it premises. This contrast of immersion and lack thereof is rare, and I cannot say I've seen anything quite like it before. I've never even seen an action series that's engrossed me as much\n          \n        as this one. To the review: \nStory: Lelouch, the main character, is granted magical powers by a mysterious girl and he uses these powers to defeat an oppressing government. Saying that much already spoiled the first two episodes so instead of talking about the plot, let’s talk about what the plot does well. This series is immensely plot-driven; that is, everything happens because of the plot, because the plot demands for it to happen. The series has this \"man vs fate\" (and, at points, \"fate vs man\") undertone that drives the characters, though that is not to say that it is the main theme of the plot. I'd call it more of a motif. The plot delves ambitiously at just about all of the archetypical conflicts: the previously mentioned man vs society: Lelouch (and quite a few others) vs Britannia, man vs self being Lelouch vs his principles as well as Suzaku vs his, man vs man being Lelouch vs just about everyone but more importantly Suzaku vs Kallen, and naturally, the most archetypical of them all, mech vs mech. There’s plenty of mech vs mech. There’s so many plots for so many characters all running simultaneously almost as in concert with one another, never turning into knots nor logically conflicting with one another. It’s truly a masterful spectacle of storytelling. \n\nArt: It is what it is. You got the big heads, big eyes, long bodies, huge boobies, though it does lack the mandatory antennas. There's mechs and pretty fights, and particularly good directing. Let's not pretend too much that I know about this topic. It's pretty, ok?\nSound: It is what it needs to be when it needs to be so. The voice acting is spectacular, I haven't seen the dub but I've heard good things about it. \nCharacters: Lelouch is in mine and everyone's favorites. He's sitting at number one most favorited on this site at the time of this writing. I'd describe him as grandiose in character, yet humble in intents. The characters are all generally well written, each with their own appearances and goals. The characters are mostly all round and dynamic, for better or for worse. I personally developed an exceptional fondness for a few characters: Shirley, Euphemia, and C. C.\nEnjoyment: The sheer genius of the plot was enough to draw me in. Add on top of that over the top mech battles and characters like Lelouch and Shirley, and you have me binge watching this every time. \nOverall: This anime gets an 8 from me. It's not without it's flaws, but it's still one of the best series I've ever watched.\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    THIS REVIEW IS FOR R2 AS WELL.\nI've heard Code Geass compared to Death Note many times. I agree with this comparison for the most part for the following reasons:\n-The main character is an absolute genius\n-The main character will go to drastic measure to make sure his goal is achieved\n-His goal is ultimately to make the world a better place \nIn these ways the stories of Lelouch and Light Yagami are clearly very similar. However I cannot agree to say that Lelouch and Light are essentially the same character. Death Note made me really sad because I felt that Light essentially corrupted himself and by the\n          \n        end of Death Note I felt he was just a psycho and felt it was time for him to die. I feel as if Light Yagami ultimately was consumed by a lust for power and reaching the status of a god. When I watched Code Geass I did not feel this way about Lelouch. While there were times where it seemed as if he may have gone to far I was able to root for him the whole way. \nStory 10/10\nThe story is set in a futuristic world where the oppressive Britannian Empire controls much of the world. Lelouch is a brilliant high school student with an unknown past. The adventure begins when he meets the mysterious CC. Lelouch sets out to make the world a better place for his sister Nunally.\nArt 7/10\nThe art was fine but I am not a huge fan of the Clamp style artwork with the triangle faces and pointy chins. The animation as good.\nSound 9/10\nSome of the Opening songs really got me pumped up. I know that some of the Code Geass songs have mixed reviews but I personally thought they were good and grew on me. As for the soundtrack, I thought it was really good, it fit the show quite well and did a good job setting the moods.\nCharacters 10/10\nProbably the best part of the show, mainly Lelouch. Lelouch is one of my favorite all time characters. There may be times in the show where you want to give up on him, but ultimately he will not dissapoint you.\nEnjoyment 10/10\nI thought Code Geass was incredible. It easily makes my top 5 list. Lots of drama and cliffhangers, great action sequences, great characters, lots of emotion. I thought Code Geass had possibly the best ending of any show I have seen.\nOverall 10/10\nVery well done. A masterpiece and an all-time  great."},

Japan is ruled by Brittania and the Japanese people that originally lived are forced to live in slums and do not have access to equal rights and resources.\nLelouch is part of the royal Britannian family and after gaining the power to make people obey him simply by looking them in the eye, he vows vengeance on Britannia and endeavours to obtain equal rights for the Japanese by whatever means necessary.\nUpsides\nCode Geass contains an abundance of high action psychological and physical\n          \n        fight scenes as well as the added drama of Lelouch fighting members of his own family.\nThe relationships Lelouch has with a childhood friend who is now fighting in the Britannian army is a very captivating part of this anime. There are also many other interesting relationships, such as Lelouch and his friend and family member Euphemia who also thinks that what Britannia Is oding is wrong but refuses to take thew same drastic and homicidal measures that Lelouch does\nDownsides\nThis anime focuses more on riveting plot twists, dramatic deaths and intense fight scenes rather than the writing and fort his reason the writing is a bit weak at times. However, this is just a minor flaw and it is still very much an enjoyable anime."},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3, ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Don't let the art fool you, this anime has been around since 2006. So given its age, its still KILLING every anime/manga script out there. I loved watching this for the 10th time. It never gets old. For along time, the main character Lelouch has been my favorite anime character. I would put him as my AVI on all Social Media. And I still do to this day. As I did started watching this show when it aired on Adult Swim, I instantly fell in loved with it. When I found out the voice actors were the same cast that voiced Naruto and Bleach I\n          \n        went fucking nuts. Japanese actors weren't bad at all. Both Eng Dub, and Sub were exactly as seen and it didn't ruin my understanding of the Anime. I remember, I would go online and watch every unreleased episode that I could find. And read the manga to further find out. This show is no doubt one of the best, if not THE BEST, anime ever. I love everything about. The mysterious power of GEASS. The medieval creation in the names of every Mech and Battleship, and how historically this all fits with out history. Geographically understanding politics and separation of powers. Learning everything, and finding out what and why Lelouch did what he did was brilliant. He's an even greater mastermind than L or Light ever was. Death Note did have the shocking reveal per episode. What I really liked about Code Geass, was that cliff hanger after the Climax of each and every episode. No resolve at all. It encourages me to find out and keep wanting more. I like that. More anime's should do that. Every little detail from the Geass abilities, to who is really God, Charles's weapon to destroy God, Princes and princesses, Guren vs Lancelot and the historic beef of their creators, the death of a family member but you still move on, everything from this show is stunning. I really do hope this continues on. I still can't believe SUNRISE thought this show would fail at first. It really shows what the industry don't know about the hearts of people. Anyways I give this show a 10, Obviously as it is still for the past 11 years, still my number 1 favorite Anime of all time. I really encourage Anime fans to check it out. If you like methodical shit that will blow your fucking mind, this is the show for you my friend. Don't get discourage of the art and the mechs, the art reveals it beauty after some understanding. Trust me this one is a lot to take in.\n        "},

Rather than doing Part 1 (R1) and Part 2 (R2) of Code Geass separately, I'm going to write this review for both parts, since it's one of those stories that really should be considered as a whole, rather than as two separate parts. Let's begin. \nThe connection between Code Geass and\n          \n        the Legend of King Arthur is unmistakeable. Excalibur chooses Arthur as its wielder and the masses come fawning toward him. Using his newfound influence, Arthur seeks the guidance of Merlin, who sets him on the path of kingship. Meanwhile, his best friend, Lancelot, a born a commoner, builds a name for himself as the strongest knight in the land, and subsequently falls in love with Guinevere, a member of royalty and former love of King Arthur. After discovering their love affair, King Arthur orders Guinevere's death. Despite a valiant attempt, Lancelot fails to save her. Wanting revenge, Lancelot seeks out Arthur to exact his vengeance. Although Lancelot kills several of Arthur's knights, he is ultimately unsuccessful and the two reconcile. After Arthur's death, Lancelot lives out the rest of his life as a masked hermit in the woods, sometimes referred to as the black knight.\nOftentimes, viewers struggle to describe just what Code Geass is - is it an adventure, is it a tear-jerking romance, is it a fun-filled slice of life, is it a mecha action romp, is it a supernatural mystery, is it a psychological thriller? Although Code Geass is rightfully all of these things, I think the comparisons to the Arthurian legends best exemplifies it's most prevailing characteristic - it's a Shakespearean tragedy. So if you're into dramatic stories with an action/adventure/supernatural/romance/psychological/mecha/comedy/mystery twist, then Code Geass is the show for you.\n(Warning: Spoilers ahead)\nStory: 10 (Outstanding)\nCode Geass boasts one of the most multi-faceted (and brilliantly complex) stories in anime. It takes a deep look into several different genres without over-indulging on anything. In short, Code Geass is able to succeed because of its attention to detail, and the fact that it takes its sweet time constructing each of its storylines, while simultaneously keeping us interested. The most important byproduct of their patience is that the relationships portrayed in the story are actually realistic. They don't jump at you out of the blue like in some Animes (I'm looking at you, Angel Beats!). A good example of this is the romance between Suzaku and Euphemia. In the portrayal of a budding romance between a chivalrous knight and the sweet princess, the author succeeds where many before him have failed miserably, and I mean miserably. In general, goodie-goodie romances in anime are terribly written and make no sense. That's why typically anime/manga writers will make the guy or girl have a bit of a bad-boy/bad-girl streak, like in Clannad. But Code Geass has no such problem. As a result, when Euphemia finally confessed how much she loved Suzaku's awkwardness around cats (yes, it's a spoiler, but you'll have no idea what I mean until you watch it), even the most hardened viewers couldn't help but shed a few tears, even if you hated those two characters as individuals. And because of the tragedy that befall these two star-struck lovers, it was the only time I ever wished that the author would actually pull out the old deus ex machina switcheroo on us and change their tragic fates. But of course Code Geass doesn't take fan requests. It shouldn't. Because Suzaku and Euphemia's  demise subsequently sets up the perfect mechanism to drive the rest of the story into fruition. That's not to say the author left us high and dry. For those who actually wanted to see an ending that wasn't ridiculously sad, the author gave us Ogi and Villetta, two side characters that paralleled the Suzaku/Euphemia arc, just not as terrible. And that's not even the main story. The main story is about a high schooler who tries to take over the world with a supernatural power and the help of an immortal companion. Sound familiar? (see below)\nCharacters: 10 (Outstanding)\nNo, this isn't Death Note, although one can make a lot of comparisons between the two shows, Code Geass, at its core, distinguishes itself from Death Note with its far more impressive cast of characters. Like Light Yagami of Death Note, Lelouch Lamprouge of Code Geass is an evil genius who wants to take over the world, in order to make it a better place, according to him. But unlike Light, Lelouch isn't just some emo high schooler - GASP! - Lelouch actually has feelings - DOUBLE GASP! - and is very relatable. Even though his intentions are somewhat selfish and ill-advised, viewers will often find themselves rooting for him after seeing his interactions with his friends, and how he actually cares about the people who suffer because of his actions. Unlike Light, Lelouch is capable of regret, and this regret is portrayed on several different levels throughout the entire show. However, although Lelouch is noted as a genius, and considered by many viewers to be the smartest character in anime, to say he's a genius is a bit of misnomer. In my opinion, he's actually not that smart. Specifically, he's very mistake-prone. But that's a good thing. Not only does that add to his relatability, it is because of his mistakes along the way that he is ultimately able to succeed in his goal, albeit at extreme costs, where Light was ultimately nothing but a complete loser in the end. Beyond Lelouch, our main character (who's also sort of an anti-hero), the remaining cast of characters - from the psychotic lesbian groupie Nina Einstein, to the annoying-to-hero assassin Rolo, to the gullible sidekick Kallen, to the perpetually guarded Villeta, to the obsessively loyal Orange Boy, to the beloved sister Nunally, to the conflicted friend/lover Shirley, to the Knight in Bloodied armor Suzaku and the strong-but-weak Euphemia - are all unique individuals who grow along their own sidestories. And all of the side-stories conclude in a very satisfying manner. The writer doesn't leave the viewers hanging like in some animes. Also, it might be worthwhile to note that, as I said in the intro, a lot of the characters are based off characters from the Legend of King Arthur. Lelouch is Arthur, of course. Geass is Excalibur. CC is Merlin. Most of the characters including Kallen, Ogi, and Suzaku are knights. Suzaku, of course, is Lancelot. His mecha is actually named Lancelot, and he has a cat named Arthur, as if it wasn't obvious enough. There are many more comparisons, but I won't get into that here. Watch the show!\nThere's actually one more thing I wanted to point out before we move on - pacing. The pace of this story is very steady throughout the entire show... until the end. The final couple episodes covered a lot of ground in very little time, and it only got faster and faster, as suddenly a year was gone in the blink of an eye. And it's not like how some stories will have that \"1 year later...\" sequence where they tell you how everyone's doing after the conclusion of the story - no, this one year skip (smack dab in the middle of the episode) was before the conclusion. I believe this is because the creators of Code Geass: Lelouch's Rebellion absolutely despised fillers, they detested anything that even resembled a filler. They could have easily added a whole other series in that period of time, but declined to so because they didn't have any other storylines to wrap up, and it would have amounted to something of a filler. Now compare that to shows like Naruto, that just wants to make a quick buck off their success. Code Geass was created by artists, not businessmen, and the results are obvious to everyone who watches it. My only gripe with that point, however, is the transition from R1 to R2. But it will take too many hard spoilers for me to explain, so you'll just have to watch it to see for yourself.\nArt: 7 (Good)\nHere's where the score starts to fall a bit. The art in Code Geass is nothing to brag about. The characters all look like the anime version of Olive Oyl (Popeye's GF). Everyone is way too lanky and skinny, and why are all of their shoulders so pointy? The character faces are not really distinct beyond their hair (which is true of most anime outside of a few exceptions), all their clothing look stupid, and they all kind of look like aliens. The mecha designs and animation are only average for an anime, and downright bad for a mecha-show. Some of the mechs look really ugly, and the animation pales in comparison to Code Geass: Akito the Exiled, the successor to Code Geass: Lelouch's Rebellion (the story in Akito is far inferior though). Lelouch's mech, in particular, looks quite dumb. But luckily most of the fighting is done by Kallen and Suzaku who have great looking mechs. So it's not all bad. There are some great fight scenes, though. Basically anytime you see Kallen or Suzaku fight, you have reason to get excited. (And that happens quite often) But the best thing about the fight scenes in Code Geass is really that all the fights are meaningful. They're not just fighting for the sake of fighting, and they're not trying to beat up the other side so that they'll see eye to eye. No, there's always a real reason behind every fight, which is important because it adds weight behind the action. In fact, if the purpose suddenly disappeared for whatever reason, Lelouch will actually tell his men to stop fighting. That almost never happens in lesser anime where it's all about punching your opponent until he understand the value of friendship (Hey there, Naruto!). \nSound: 7 (Good)\nThe sound is not bad, but again, it falls short of the standards set by the story. The sound effects were not spectacular, when it easily could have been. The intro/outros were only half decent. COLORS, by Flow, was the show's only good song. The rest were not really that memorable. Other than Mosaic Kakeru, I honestly can't remember how the other two intros and outros went. I just remember that they sounded like evil marching music, which fits with the show, I guess. There is another redeeming quality to the sound though - the voice acting. Both the Japanese and English dub voice actors have won a plethora of awards for their work on Code Geass. And it shows. Watch it in either version and you won't be let down, at least not by the voice acting.\nEnjoyment: 9 (Great)\nCode Geass is a very enjoyable experience. It doesn't get a 10, however, because it's exposition is a little on the slow side, and hard to take in all at once - Great Britain conquering Japan - wah? But it's a very good show that's light-hearted when it wants to be - and does a good job of it, and serious when it wants to be - and does a good job of that. It has a healthy dose of pretty much everything. And although I wouldn't consider Lelouch a genius by a long shot, and I get annoyed everytime someone calls him a genius, I do agree that he CAN be very clever at times, staying true to his character, without being unrealistic. Even though Lelouch is trying to take over the world, he does it in a way that tries to sway the hearts and minds of the people at the risk of endangering himself, rather than simply using his magical powers to force people to obey him. And in a lot of ways, Lelouch is like Ikarus, just a kid who wants to fly as close to the sun as he can. That, in and of itself, is sort of admirable, and so he's very easy to cheer for - as oppose to Light Yagami of Death Note, who's practically impossible to root for. That adds a lot to the intangibles of this show. \nOverall: 9 (Great)\nAll in all, Code Geass: Lelouch's Rebellion is a great show. Although it's multi-genred, it stays focused on telling its story, and does a great job of fitting all the pieces together. There is a smidge of touching upon social views and racism as well. If you want to watch a show that's smart, touchingly sad, and action-packed - watch Code Geass. It's one of those shows, that, as you're watching the final episode, you wish would never end.

The whole world just all of a sudden decided to invade Japan? I mean come on, what's so good about the country that it's worth invading like that. It's full of people, running out of land, and running out of resources. The anime didn't give any reason whatsoever as to why the Area 7 people were looked down upon so much. On top of that, the invading countries are all developed countries, I thought the world was done with annexing other countries?..\nAfter the beginning of the anime the story line gradually grew better (thank god).\n          \n        Much more interesting and has a good futuristic feel to it. However, what the hell happened to the end?!? It ended so suddenly ( I didn't read the manga so I don't know if that's how it ended ) and for any anime to end like that is already a 'D' in my book. A cliff hanger ending is ridiculous.\n        "},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=9, ["text"]="\n\nCode Geass is the answer to the question \"What if the stereotypical mastermind villain was the good guy?\" A marvel of a series and very unique and different. It applies shoujo-style layered character, melodramatic tragedy to a shounen-style mecha war story, producing something unique and engaging that is neither overblown in style and structured yet brutally unsentimental, Code Geass is defined by the meticulous scheming of Lelouch, the anti-hero who carries the show. . The CLAMP character designs, fluid animation, and varied mecha combat are all part of the picture, but when it comes down to it the reason you watch are for those moments\n          \n        when Lelouch smiles sadistically and you realize he's already won, usually by savage blindide. His personality and willing decent into a hell of his own making are backed by a commanding Japanese performance and framed by a colorful cast of people doomed to be broken by fate.\nCasting villain as hero and hero as villain, Code Geass twists a stock melodramatic war story into something new and deliciously malicious. The series rides almost entirely on the shoulders of its ultimate anti-hero, which turns out to be its greatest strength. It's neither uplifting nor weepy--it's a ruthless chess match set to a symphony of brutality that is as gripping as it is unusual. In short, wicked, tragic fun. Code Geass also emphasizes on the general theme of \"revenge\". If you ever seen Death note where the show took more of a verbal approach at trying to out do each other between L and Light yagami's both genius minds who are rivals that are trying to defeat each other. To win the war against Kira. Thats kind of how code geass is portrayed, the one question you have to ask your self when watching this show is \"who is the good guy'? \"who is the bad guy\". Throughout this show, there is some one on the darker side and the one that is behind the curtain so to speak, then there is one character that is on the good side. But you will never realize who it is, because the show uses alot of confusing complex multi sided personalities for each character that keeps you guessing. But just that complex reality of two characters thrown into a chaos of war, both with genius minds trying to strategize every action keeps you wanting more and more and its hardly a show you will drop because of that. Its very satisfying, new and refreshing and i think fans of mecha action and serious character dramatic overtones will enjoy this series.\n        "},

Meaning I started watching this in 6th grade which is when my anime craze began. I absolutely love this anime and the entire story is just phenomenal. It is a serious anime, I'll give you that which makes it hard for many people to watch it if they aren't the type to actually work their brains while watching anime. \nIt's an amazing story of a certain country who's name has been changed to Britannia probably for political reasons who thinks they are the super god-like country of the world who can take over\n          \n        everyone and everything with no equal matched opponents in existence. Don't underestimate the will of people because you are about to be proved wrong.\nAmazing. Watch it.

I see no point in separating them. *Also Beware of Spoilers*\nThis was a breathe taking spectacular anime that doesn’t disappoint. Right from the start, you get foreshadowing of what the story will be about. Lelouch sitting in rubble from a war stricken country, tells his friend Suzaku that he will obliterate Britannia. From there, you know what the story will be about. A beginning is set with an end goal in mind, and then\n          \n        the story is told of how it all happens from then on. \nIt jumps right into the story; Lelouch is thrown right into action as he accidentally gets involved in an incident between terrorists and the Britannian army. He meets his friend underground in the stolen terrorist truck and C2 from the capsule; from there on he is forced to run in mortal danger as his life is at risk. He is put into a life or death situation where he is helpless. Then C2 jumps in and grants him an amazing power which saves his life and consequentially speeds up his initial plans. He has gained the magnificent power which allows him to compel others to do his bidding. \nThis story is one that is filled with action and all sorts of drama that will leave you wanting more. There is little to almost no filler as almost everything has a significant role to play throughout the story.  \nAll sorts of characters are brought to life that all have their own significant history and purpose in some way. The characters are introduced one at a time. Kallen whose mother was an “eleven” and her father who is Britannian has her story and her reasons why she joined and fights with the terrorists. Nunnally who is blinded and crippled has her story of hardship as she endured what Lelouch has and stayed with him the whole time. Suzaku who killed his father when he was young, endures the torture of living as he wants to die but can’t die due to the geass Lelouch put on him telling him to live. He joins the army and does whatever he can as a sort of way to repent for his previous mistake, which in the end is what he ends up doing as he gives up his life to serve as the icon of zero for the rest of his life. C2 who is immortal and cannot die is burdened with living for eternity as she struggles through points in time that she would not otherwise wanted to live through. Her tale is a tragic one and explains much about her and her nature. Euphy, who is much like a princess, cannot escape her child like state where she is constantly guarded and used as a figure head as she is protected and binded down. Shirley who is in love with Lelouch would even give her life for him despite the fact that he killed her father; she dies a very tragic death as she killed by Rolo. Rolo was also an interesting character who loves Lelouch as a brother and ends up giving his life to protect him as the only time that felt real to him was when he was with Lelouch despite it being fake. All the characters portrayed were simply all amazing in their own way and truly added to the story in one way or another.\nThe way that Lelouch and Suzaku both take opposing sides and have different views of justice really adds to the action and drama. Two best friends that cannot agree with each other destined to clash at some point. Though it’s slightly tragic, it certainly adds to the overall appeal. It’s also quite unexpected that they ended up working together in the end to realize their plan for the world.\nLelouch’s goal is a farfetched one as taking down such a predominant country is very unlikely, this one goal that starts it all is brought into a real perspective as Lelouch gets the power of Geass and slowly gains more power with his group/ allies/connections. It’s quite interesting to see how his complicated and ornate plans will turn out and what sort of plot twists will come up next.\nThis anime introduces and combines all sorts of popular aspects that can be found from other relevant material; Gundam like robots, Death Note like properties, 13 Knights of the Round Table, The Order of the Black Knights , Romeo and Juliet, etc. If you look hard enough you can find a lot of reference material that you wouldn’t think about at first. It’s all brilliantly meshed together in one awesome anime.\nThe anime truly keeps you guessing and on edge wanting more as you progress further into it. The battles are fantastic and action packed filled with excitement. The ways Lelouch uses his Geass power in very intricate ways to get his plans to work is quite fascinating as well. As things progress, it gets more serious, the whole slip up with using Geass on Euphy, then the huge battle afterword. Nunnally getting kidnapped, the cliffhanger mid-way through with Suzaku and Lelouch, then the events that follow, all the people escaping out of Japan, the china forces joining Lelouch, King Charles being betrayed by his country and Schneizel. Everything sort of builds up you could say. Throughout the story, all the plot twists really take you for a spin but will leave you wanting more. When I think about this anime, I think that I couldn’t have made it better myself even if I wanted to. \nLelouch’s goals initially included getting revenge on Britannia, his father, and making a better world for his sister Nunnally. Once he got his revenge, he then decided to follow through with his decision to improve the world for the better for his sister’s sake. \nThe ending was also quite significant as Lelouch was killed by zero, the hero he invented at the beginning. He formed his plan with the symbol of zero in mind. Zero stood for freedom and prosperity and it served as a icon for the people from the start. Zero wasn’t necessarily represented as one person. Anyone can be zero so long as they represent what he stands for. That idea and thought was shown as the end as that’s what occurred. Lelouch allowed himself to be killed by zero as zero was their icon that brought the people hope from the start. \nThe ending, as tragic as it was, you have to admit, there could have been no better ending. It fits perfectly and really goes with the story quite well. The ending really gets to you as well.Whether or not you’re the emotional type, you have to admit the ending was extremely sad and emotional. I personally cried at the end, and I’ve never really done that over any anime before. But it was also a quite fair anime with a brilliant ending that gave you a choice on how you chose to perceive it. You could think that Lelouch died or that he somehow survived and was there at the end with C2 on the carriage. An ending that gives you that kind of choice is certainly a well thought out one that deserves its credit. If anything, it was a certainly different perspective compared to those generic endings which all end up happy. \nNo matter how you look at this anime, it is one of a kind. Whether you do or don’t agree with some certain aspects about it, you cannot deny that it is one of the best out there. I don’t really see much wrong with it. I give it a 10/10. I would even go as far as to put this in my top 10 anime list as it was an amazing anime that left an impression on me. If this isn’t a 10, then I don’t know what is. Others that would give this a 9 are just buttheads because they don’t really know what an amazing anime really is; on their scale no anime is perfect, so screw them. Anyways, that about sums it up, hope you liked my review."},

I say that but I do have a minor complaint with the dub having annoying MINOR characters but the main characters are done very well and make the show great.

			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=6, ["text"]="\n                          \n    Code Geass ... he is getting old, but it's still stylish.\nThis is my favorite anime, although I was able 10/10 to other anime, it will not necessarily 10/10, because as we can know, on 50 episodes ago has more faults than 12 anime episodes.\nHowever, history is just great, a student of royal blood who has been rejected as small, and wants revenge, it is certainly not very original either, but the way things have turned, and especially his way of thinking, it will always surprise us, making history a point where we do not expect it from the start. It is a 10/10.\nThe graphic style\n          \n        is not the most beautiful in the world, far from it, but for an anime released in 2007, it is very beautiful. 9/10\nIn whole, the sound is good, but sometimes it feels good repetitive effect remixing and this is a negative point, however, the music they are very good and I recommend the OST. 9/10\nThe characters ... my god the characters. Lelouch is just the perfect \"anti-hero\". It is quiet and doubtful at first, but becomes increasingly sadistic and cruel to his enemies As the advance of history, it can vaguely remember Light in Death Note. Suzaku throughout the anime, the character was for me the most boring, it has no charisma, the only time I found it of interest, that is when he was with Lelouch as his personal knight. It's a shame because all the other characters are nice, but I will quote another just after. 9/10\nFinally, the anime is very entertaining, however there are some breaks in history that I found zero and even completely unnecessary, particularly that with Mao, which I found boring to die, but otherwise it's reasonable. 8/10\nThis anime is therefore the one I prefer, despite all its flaws, but I advise you tremendously because if you do not look, you may miss a little gem that I personally love.\n        "},

The plot was really good, the characters were heartfelt and dealt powerful blows upon death. A real tear jerker at times, it truly was magnificent.

			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    When I saw the trailer, I was a little bit sceptical about this anime. But then I decided to watch the first episode and I must admit that I didn't suspect that it's so good. Right now this anime is one of my favourite animes. \nFirstly we get introduced to Japan (year 2010) which is invaded by the Holy Britannian Empire. Then we have a time jump to the year 2017 (we are still in Japan) where we get to know the main character called Lelouch Lamperouge. \nLelouch is a student in Ashford Academy. Everyone think that he is a normal person, but in reality\n          \n        he is a Britannian prince called Lelouch vi Britannia. One day unexpectedly he is in a crime place where a girl C.C gets shot but before that she gives him a power called Geass. \nFrom that moment Lelouch decides to become someone else. He becomes Zero.\nStory: 9\n I think that this anime has a great story, but not that great to get a 10. In my opinion the anime didn't need so much violence as it showed in the episode where Princess Euphemia declared a massacre on Japaneese people. Otherwise it has a very good story which shows how much someone you love is important.\nArt: 10\nThis anime has a great art. I could only wish that I could draw manga characters like those animators. I like the colors they used, the colors in the anime is a symbolic. An example on that is character called Nunnally. Nunnally has dress with happy colors and her hair is light. It shows that this character is positive. Nunnally has a positive aura around herself.\nSoundtrack: 10\nI am not a music specialist, but I think that the soundtrack they did for this anime is great. I liked especially the lyrics of the intro and outro songs. They fit perfectly to the anime and they are kind of a summary of the anime.\nCharacter: 10\nThat person who made the characters of the series is a genius. The characters is shown by their brightest but also of their darkest sides. Which helps you perfectly to understand the anime.\nEnjoyment:9\nI would give this anime 10 if it wasn't that violent, because I don't enjoy that much violence.\nOverall: 10\nI think you understand why😅\nThe anime has a great plot and animation. I mostly love this anime for the fantastic characters. Code Geass is a perfect example for how the rebellion works and how much they can do to get their country independent. It also shows that if you love someone, you will do everything for them, even join a terrorist group."},

There is a constant dark tone throughout the entire anime which makes every moment suspenseful and also makes you want to keep watching after an episode is done. Trust me I've watched this anime several times and i still cant stop. Although the dark tone, the writers were able to loosen things\n          \n        up just in the nick of time. Every few episodes there is an episode that is more funny and light hearted to loosen the mood. From valentines day parties to chasing a cat around school. Even though these episodes are funny and light hearted doesn't mean they dont effect the story in any way, heck they are pretty important to the story. \nOverall, i really enjoyed this anime and i suggest it to anyone who likes awesome mechs and war strategy. I rated this 10/10 and its my all time  favorite anime.\nthanks for reading my review :D \n~Aggronian (Josh)\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=8, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    What can I say about Code Geass that hasn't already been said? Let me say it is a rollercoaster ride. You never know what is going to happen with this show. Tensions are always high from the word go and the intensity does not slow down. Even in the most innocent looking scenes will arise major points. Just when you think something will go right for a change, something else will happen to change it.\nLelouch, the main character, is in it for revenge. Without spoiling to much, his whole fight is to find out the culprit of one crime. With such a 2D motivation for\n          \n        a character's reasons to fight, how can he be a likable protagonist?\nWell, he isn't, and his amazing theme song titled Nightmare supports that in both name and nature. You know that no one is in the right in this story. There are those who fight for reasons of loyalty, there are those who fight for their own ideals, there are those who fight just to bring peace, but everyone is morally gray. You respect the characters of both sides of the conflict and you don't want to see the tragedy that lies behind any of them.\nI'll be honest, sometimes this anime might be full on. I personally dropped that anime once or twice because I couldn't handle the full impact of the storyline. This doesn't mean I didn't like the anime. I picked it back up and continued to watch, not forgetting what tragedies made me both love and hate this series.\nThe art style is one of beauty as well, and the music, minus the second opening, was all perfectly placed. I think that the art was a good mix between the regular cartoon style of animes like Lucky Star and the more refined style of animes like Zankyou no Terror. It perfectly suits it. And the music perfectly fits the scenes, the characters, and the show overall.\nI can't recommend Code Geass to everyone. It is quite full on. As I previously mentioned I had to drop the series because it was too much. But if you can reach the end of the rollercoaster, I assure you that you will enjoy almost every minute, so long as you can handle it.\n        "},

It successfully takes one of the most overused plot structures, the rebellion story, and executes it almost perfectly. Two main characters on opposing sides and almost equal screentime allows for excellent storytelling, and couple that with the fact that the two know each other allows for some shocking revelations for the characters. The plot twists are amazing and still get me after watching the series three times. At no point does the story feel rushed or out-of-nowhere. There are almost no important characters that aren't fleshed out. None of the supernatural abilities feel overpowered or\n          \n        underpowered, and when multiple are involved it becomes a battle of wit.

			{["score"]=7, ["helpful"]=3, ["text"]="                          \n    Light Spoilers Ahead\nThe plot to this show had potential that was wasted. Basically, a guy acquires the power to make anyone do anything he says. However, sometimes during the show you will forget he even has the power because he can go a whole episode without using it or even mentioning it. Or maybe I was just asleep and missed some of it. \nThe show is honestly nothing about the power at all. It's about some future setting where \"Britanians\" take over the world and the protagonist tries to take them down.\nI feel like this show could've been so much better if it was just\n          \n        a guy in a normal world who used his powers to become a world leader or something, instead of making a show with something that's hard to follow (mainly because a lot of it is just silly and/or boring, like how one scene they're having a party for a cat and the next scene they're fighting people to the death with robots). However if they went that route it may have ended up being way too similar to Death Note. It still would've been better than it is now, however. \nThis show tries too hard to take every element from popular animes and throw them into one. You got fighting robots, a power similar to Death Note, etc. and it didn't blend very well, especially with the weird art style where everyone has a pointed chin and has legs twice the size of their bodies. Not to mention the constant fan pleasing and random nip slips. Hey, I'm not one to oppose an anime tiddy but if that's all a show has to offer... come on. Half the time while watching this show all I could think was \"honestly... what's even happening.\"\nI got the same feeling throughout the entirety of Sword Art Online where I'm just constantly at a state of confusion wondering if I accidentally clicked a parody or something because there's no way this actually aired. \nIf an anime gives you the same feeling as Sword Art Online... that's not a very good sign.\nI'm going to watch R2 and then maybe I'll change my opinion... but so far it's only getting a 7 and I'm being very generous.

			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=8, ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I had no idea what to expect when I first started watching this anime series. I don’t even remember why I watched it to begin with. However, by the end of the first episode I was hooked. The main character Lelouch is an exiled noble and high school student living as an average Britannian (one of society’s upper-class) in a conquered and annexed Japan. After attempting to help at a car accident he gets wrapped up in a heist led by Japanese rebels which ends in him being given a strange power by a mysterious girl named C-2. His power, called Geass, allows him to\n          \n        command a person to do absolutely anything, as long as he can make direct eye contact with that person.\nLelouch, who despises his government and his father (who is the emperor that exiled him and his sister) becomes “Zero,” a mystery hero for rebels across the world. He lives a double life as a student at a prestigious school, and the leader of the world’s fastest growing terrorist/rebel organization.\nLelouch is a strategic genius, and he uses his Geass power with horrifying efficiency. Even though he can only use it on a person one time, he easily discovers ways to outclass Britannia’s greatest military generals. He manipulates powerful global forces while never disturbing the image of himself as an innocent school boy.\nThe story becomes more dramatic as Lelouch’s personal school friends began getting involved with the large-scale wars that are enveloping the world. His best friend, Suzaku, enlists in the military and quickly progresses to the top as a genius mech pilot. Suzaku, a staunch believer in righteousness and taking the moral high ground, is often at odds with Zero (who he doesn’t realize is his best friend) who uses deceptive and underhand tactics to get his way. Another of Lelouch’s classmates, Collin, is secretly a rebel fighting under Zero, and even she doesn’t know of Zero’s true identity.\nThe tension between all of these characters steadily increases as their school personalities diminish in favor of their increasingly important lives as soldiers, rebels, and tacticians. Meanwhile, Lelouch, as Zero, becomes drunk with power and invents increasingly dastardly and morally questionable schemes to overthrow the government of Britannia. Hiding his identity becomes increasingly difficult, especially when it comes to light that Lelouch isn’t the only person with special powers. At one point a man named Mao confronts him, someone with the ability to read people’s minds. He is jealous of Lelouch for having won the affection of C-2 and will do anything to get her back. His power poses a serious problem for Lelouch, who is physically weak and has always relied on his strategic mind. The resulting battle between them is epic, and requires Lelouch to take chances that he would normally avoid.\nEventually Lelouch’s identity becomes known to more and more forces within the world, and this gives others ways to blackmail him or to understand his goals better. As Lelouch becomes increasingly distant from his friends and relatives, he must decide whether to continue on the path of blood or turn back and salvage any hope of living a peaceful life. His maddening desire to dominate drives him to the brink, and by the end of the series he will have to decide whether or not to take the most extreme of measures to create the ideal world that he dreams of.\nThe series isn’t perfect. There are some embarrassingly bad moments, such as the Super Electromagnetic Shrapnel Cannon (oh god), and a rough, perhaps unnecessary, plot transition into the second season. However by the end all is forgiven. Code Geass is a masterful story about friendship and sacrifice, one in which the characters experience blissful happiness between bouts of exceptional suffering. This series is a must for fans of action or drama, though I would personally recommend it to anyone who considers themselves a fan of anime in general. If you haven’t seen Code Geass yet, prepare yourself for a treat.\n        "},

What truly makes it great is the lack of good side and bad side, as there are good principles\n          \n        on each. \nThe characters are not flawless, but they are strong, characterizing human nature and its flaws and strengths as well as the desire to do good. The evolution and deterioration of friendship as well as the personal goals drives each character to change and grow.\nThe animation of Lelouch and the robots is exceptional. The hand movement and facial expressions by Lelouch bring out the depth of his character as harsh cold yet in love with this world.\nNow it has been awhile since i last watched Code Geass (watched twice) but as i can recall the music did not detract from any part of Code Geass.\nOne of my favorite animes I highly recommend this somewhat mind blowing anime that contains a lot of originality. It is definitely worth watching and is the closest anime to masterpiece, which I am still hunting for!\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=8, ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I'll admit I'm not a fan of any anime that uses robots to fight, but this anime doesn't revolve around simply technology and mechanisms; it includes what I love most: psychology and action with a purpose. I did not expect to like this anime nor did I expect an anime to from 2006 to have the aesthetics I typically prefer. So I dismissed it as an anime I wouldn't enjoy. Lo and behold a year later, I decided to give the anime a shot out of my lack of things to watch. I freaking love this anime so much that I'm reviewing it at only\n          \n        20/25 episodes at night because I feel the urge to let others know before I continue to watch another episode that this is worth your time. \n\nA British teen boy named Lelouch is fighting against Brittania all derived from his own ideology of what justice is. However, in order for immediate change in a strict corrupt society violence is necessary. Violence may only physically harm the individual targeted, but it simultaneously psychologically injures those who witness or are indirectly affected by it. His counter part Suzaku an eleven (Japanese citizen under control of British rule) wishes for justice too, but his methods of achieving it contradict what Lelouch believes. Long story short, various events lead these characters to their own paths whether the path is the same or different. \n\nThat summary was pretty poor and did the story little justice, so please let me give you a chance to see the anime holistically without spoiling anything.\n1) The characters are like-able, interesting, and appealing. Some will argue that said character is annoying/obnoxious but I found all of them to be enjoyable. I found myself empathizing with both the \"enemies\" and the \"heroes\" at certain points. I switched back and forth on which side was right, and at times I found myself hating all of the actions taken. Yet when I asked myself \"What would I do?\" I had no solutions or even a remote idea.\n2) There's always action going on, I watched 10 straight episodes with my eyes glued to the screen...\n3) Progression, the anime gets better as the episodes pass. That's one of the most important things. I like not being able to predict what will happen next, but I also dislike silly plot twists with no logic. Code Geass managed to trick me plenty of times whilst staying realistic. \n4) Morals. I like those. \n\nAddition: (Just finished season 1, season 2 will go by so quick...)\nEven though the plot didn't always go the way I wanted to, no matter how strongly I wished some things didn't happen in the story. I can't bend the anime to a happy fairy tale in which everything I'd like to occur happens. That's unrealistic, this anime made me awfully happy and sad at the same time at some events, but that's what I like the most. I'm not being spoon-fed or lied, I'm given reality in each episode.\n\n"},
			{["score"]=7, ["helpful"]=8, ["text"]="\n                          \n    This serie was awesome in many ways. But I must admit that I didn't really enjoyed it. Before you just give it unhelpful please let me explain why.\nHowever Code Geass was one of the best stories I've ever seen/heard/red and almost everything about it was great. I caught myself that I was counting how much more episodes till the end. Normally I just always wanted to see the next episode and didn't want the serie to end. Maybe it was because of the mecha, maybe because of the way they brought it, maybe cause the story wasn't going fast enough or maybe because of everything.\n          \n        To be honest I do not really know why, but I can tell for sure that I didn't enjoyed it most of the time. Of course that is just my personal opinion.\nNow this is said, I would like to tell why it still deserves a 7 in my opinion.The story and the characters were outstanding. There were almost no holes in the plot and the characters. The way they let you see the story from 2 friends fighting for the same ideal but on a completely other way, even that different that they become enemies because of it. Is very original and well done. The way they fight for it and the psychological questions they handle with their way of judgement is really superb.\nI still recommend this to anyone who like psychological series about politics.\n        "},

Half-naked girls? \nCode Geass takes all of that and tries to make a killing.\nIts premises are not so original. The year's 2017: it's been seven years since the Britannian Empire has conquered Japan, now renamed Area 11, thanks to the overwhelming power of the Knightmare Frames, the show's giant mechs; but the war's not over yet, since terrorists who still call themselves Japanese are trying to retake their country, with no result. At least until our protagonist shows up. \nThe main story has a unique direction, but the methods it uses to develop itself\n          \n        are kinda questionable: bluntly put, it's a sequence of ridiculously convenient plot devices that result in a forced situation more than just a couple of times; every episode ends up in a cliffhanger, and the fact that there's actually no ending means that the Sunrise guys are making sure that you'll come back for season two.\nAbout the characters, the only remarkable ones are the main ones. Lelouch is one likeable fella: smart, authoritative and with a natural flair for melodrama, he's the guy who makes the anime go round. However, you're obliged to accept the fact that he's some sort of genius-strategist, and they (the Sunrise guys) didn't even bother to explain his backgrounds a bit better, although Kallen gets a whole episode to look deeper in her \"Japanese side\" (and for your information that was IMO the best episode); C.C. is interesting too, but I don't think they've done much with her. She's just 'there', period.\nI found almost all of the rest of the cast either dull, irritating, or just too stupid.\n Fanservice has been added in massive doses, and a great part of the ladies isn't... left unseen.\nTalking about graphics, I must say that I'm not exactly a fan of the character design and style of drawing, while animation's well done.\nThen, even if I often had a feeling that robots were there just \"because giant robots\", the mech battles were neat: robots were like infantry, and battles were fought and won by giving orders with an actual tactical value. Nothing too complicated though, the show makes it sound like a big deal, but it's nice to see something different from an ultimately-customized-robo clash. Which is exactly what you'll get in the second season.\nIn the end, Code Geass does its job as pure entertainment: it's ambitious, albeit exaggerated, and the fact that it tries not to disappoint every fandom in the universe drags the quality down. Still, I did like it the first time I watched it, but without any doubt it could have been something more than just a pretty average show.\n        "},

			{["score"]=7, ["helpful"]=8, ["text"]="                          \n    Firstly sorry for my bad english, but after watched this series I want to share some thoughts with you.\nWhen I saw the score 8.87 for ss1 and 9.00 for ss2, I was highly expecting this anime to be very good or very enjoyable. But it isn't.\nStory: 7/10. Most of first season are boring plots. Maybe it has some good episodes at the end but the rest are painful to watch. I didn't enjoy the robots and school life in this movie very much, the plot barely moves and I had a hard time to keep watching and waiting for something interesting to happen.\nArt: 7/10. Only\n          \n        CC and Suzaku are really well-made, Lelouch looks decent though but his hair is so annoying. Robots look very cool but I don't really care much. The other characters look very boring and can be seen in any animes. But the art keeps getting better and at some point you will get used to it.\nCharacter: 7/10. I really like CC, she is unique and interesting. Lelouch is really well-written, but again the other characters are mediocre, Kallen and Suzuka are a bit better though. The character development in this anime is just so-so, I can't see much aspects from the characters in this anime except Lelouch.\nEnjoyment: 6/10. Most of the screentime are boring but I got excited and surprised at the end of both ss1 and ss2. But that's not enough, I was nearly going to drop this anime about 3~4 times at some back-to-back boring episodes.\nOverall: 7/10. I think this anime is highly overrated due to the very good ending,or maybe it is more interesting if you like robot fighting and school life. But after all it still has some amazing moments that will be hard to forget though.\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=6, ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    what a perfect show! I had no idea what I was getting into when I started watching the first episode of Code Geass Lelouch of the Rebellion (english title)\nand boy was I unprepared... This is some Star Wars level stuff... Now before I start mindlessly praising it, allow me to actually write a review.\nLelouch is the main character, a young student with a troubled past, who hates his own country and father. Britain invades Japan, Japan surrenders. Lelouch is native Britain but he's forced to go to Japan with his little sister. He gets caught up in a terrorist attack waged by some Japanese rebels\n          \n        and ends up with a unique power that changes his destiny forever, and of course the fate of the world. Does it change for the better? Watch and find out \nStory 10\nAbsolutely phenomenal, there's a lot to take in as this show goes at a fast yet balanced pace. Basically, you'll always be learning new things about the grand scheme of what is really going on, but you won't be 'overwhelmed' by nonsense\nArt 10\nThis show is from 2006? Really? It could pass off for a 2015 show in terms of the art and animation. I wasn't used to the art style they used as this was the first time I experienced it, but they NAILED it, and I quickly fell in love with it. You can tell how much work and passion was put into the visuals.\nSound 10\nSome of the songs are really moving and beautiful, and the overall sound is without flaw\nCharacter 10\nthere are many, many characters, some of them being developed more than others, but if they developed all of them it would be overwhelming, and I think all the characters were fitting. \nEnjoyment 10\nwhat an outstanding show! For some reason, it reminded me of Star Wars. Well, I think it had many similarities to Star Wars. Some of the music, a lot of the technology elements, fight of good vs. evil, etc. if you like or have seen Star Wars, you'll probably notice it too, and that was just the cherry on top of the delicious cake haha\nTLDR: if you haven't seen this anime, SEE THIS ANIME\n        "},

			{["score"]=6, ["helpful"]=4, ["text"]="                          \n    This one will be hard, because i am really torn on Code Geass and not entirely sure if i like it or don't. I certainly don't love it, i can say that much, but without further ado, we're just gonna start that now. Also, i intend to spoil two scenes i hated with a passion, other then that you're probably safe to read this review.\nStory: The category i am not sure about. It starts slow, i remember that i found the first episode to be really boring, but once our MC Lelouch obtains his power and displays it in a spectacular fashion, things start to\n          \n        pick up. From this point onward the momentum steadily rises, however it also gets interrupted constantly. The culprits of this crime are a lack of intelligent decisions by anyone but Lelouch himself and the taking of massive conveniences. Some things just fall into place and normally, things like that don't even bother me, i barely even notice, but there are just such  glaring mistakes, that even i look at a scene and said to myself:\"That's probably not how it would turn out.\" There are the aforementioned two scenes that take this issue to the extreme, so beware of Spoilers!! First is Suzaku's machine gun kick, the second is the theft of the Gawain Prototype mech. Both of them make no sense, Suzaku is never mentioned to be enhanced above human capabilities and there is no way such a valuable mech could just be stolen like that. Hell, the show even established that these war machines use keys similar to a car, how is it possible to just jump in and take it?\nDespite all that, i give the story an 8. I think the first episodes are really well done and the last ones really made me feel something. To sum it up, there are moments of genius, but there is a lot of bad writing in between.\nArt: This review is going on for too long, let me shorten myself: I hate the art, i really do. The characters look stupid with their long legs and feminine faces, the mechs look like toys. The Environments are nice, but there are also colorful, which stands in a stark contrast to the more serious scenes. The females are attractive at least, the style works for them and zero looks kinda cool too. But all in all, i can only call the art decent. We get to see exposed breasts, that's worth a point to me.\nSound: Not a fan of the sound either. As with the story, there are some really great pieces in the ost, such as the battle theme, only that the majority of it is actually awful. Sometimes i am reminded of Evangelion, only that the Eva-ost is absolutely stellar. This is like a bad homage. Can't complain about the voice acting, everything seems to be on point from a foreign perspective. The first opening is okay, i hate the other ones, they are actually jarring and the first ending is fantastic. Don't care much for the second one.\nCharacter: Lelouch carries this category. A morally grey Antihero with hints of madness and a superiority-complex. He is the main character and gets the most development, which is not typical for anime at all. Everyone else is kinda bland or stereotypical. C.C. is waifu-material, Kallen is hot and i actually like Suzaku. I like most of them actually but i am also not really attached to anyone. Mainly because there are just so many. They are all going through changes, so there is character-development. I'll give at a very good, but only for the great pair of Lelouch and C.C. Honorable mention to Diethard for the sexy Kirei-voice.  \nEnjoyment: As i said: I am torn. There were times when i really felt for the cast, where i was fully engaged in the things, that were occurring. And sometimes i really had to force myself to keep watching. I am talking about the rewatch here, i actually think the show works better when you watch it for the first time and the twists surprise you. In conclusion: I rate my enjoyment \"good\", cause even if it let me down sometimes, it's overall a nice experience. And some people adore this show, so anyone should at least give it a shot.\nSo Overall, the show for me is \"kinda hail to Britannia\"? It's not bad, but it also didn't blow my mind. It was...nice. Also, the last Akito movie released, now that is some nice timing, i can wrap it up completely then. But all in due time. \n"},

That is pretty much how most anime plotlines go.\nHowever, after watching Code Geass, I realised just how wrong I have been. Although Code Geass does focus somewhat on the different models of Knightmare Frames, it mainly focuses on Lelouch's strategic planning and how\n          \n        he puts his powers to use.

It makes you want to join the fight, but at the same time, question which side you should be on. \nI think the set up of the story is incredibly well thought through and each character plays an important roll whether it's to go help fight the fight or give others the encouragement and tools they need to go fight the fight.\nLelouch is (in my humble opinion) one of the greatest characters in all of anime. The most appealing qualities about him are his quick mind, his emotional strength, and his\n          \n        passion to do what he thinks is right. \nEven though, I chose just to write a small paragraph about Lelouch, I could easily write a whole paper on each of the main characters and their relationships with one another and how it contributes to the story.\nBesides the plot and the characters, the fighting sequences are amazing and the animation style has it's own uniqueness to it. \nMy only complaint is about the few flashes of nudity. They weren't terrible and I know for anime it's pretty normal, but it didn't add anything to the story. It was just there purely for fan service and I ain't about that life.\nHowever, don't let that turn you away.

This series in particular contained a wide variety of genres, from romance to action to mecha to psychological.

The\n          \n        reason I only gave this a 9 out of 10 is because the main protagonist Lelouch can get very annoying at times. When this happens, he resembles Light Yagami from Death Note in his mannerisms, which kind of made me want to reach through the screen and punch him in the face. Nevertheless, this is an amazing series and I can guarantee that if you're interested in plenty of action involving groups of rebels trying to break free from tyranny, you'll thoroughly enjoy this series.\n        "},
			{["score"]=7, ["helpful"]=4, ["text"]="                          \n    Preface:\nMy first review, and hopefully first of many (though I have a Samurai Champloo review near completion). I’ve tried my hand at reviewing music before, so hopefully that will help my transition to anime reviewing. This is more of a log of my feelings towards a show, so I’m going to try to write one for every new show I watch. Without further ado, enjoy. \nStory: 8/10\nCode Geass is set in a dystopian Japan changed to Area Eleven after Britannia strippped Japan of all its rights. Lelouch an ex Britannian prince, now a student almost gets killed by a group of Britannian soldiers, but instead\n          \n        an immortal witch named C.C. gives him his geass which gives him the ability to control someone’s action one time if they make eye contact. With this newly acquired power Lelouch creates an alternate persona, Zero in order to overthrow Britannia to create a new world where everyone has equality and everything is fair. This show has a fantastic setup, but I feel like it gets a bit too convoluted along the way, with some of the plots elements being either dumb (like the cat stealing Lelouch’s helmet), or feeling like a deus ex machina just to push Lelouch/Zero into another corner. I also I normally hate whenever amnesia is used as a plot point, because it is extremely frustrating, but I feel like Code Geass handled it alright. If this wasn’t the first season, and it ended after episode 25 then, I would call it one of the worst cliffhangers I’ve ever witnessed. Lastly I can’t not talk about how similar this show is to Death Note, and I’m saddened that neither were able to pull off their cat and mouse plot games all that well, with death note tanking around episode 20.\nCharacters: 8/10\nLelouch Lamperouge:\nHis intelligent and isn’t afraid to get his hands dirty in order to achieve is goals of a perfect world. His whole reason for living is Nunnally his sister, for a world where they can both live safely without having to hide. He is a grand tactician and doesn't necessarily need to use his geass all the time. He does care for other people besides Nunnally and takes him a while to grasp the consequences of some of his actions. He is the most interesting character by far.\nC.C.:\nAn immortal witch who makes a contract with Lelouch when she grants him his geass. She always straightforward and serious, plus she has a deep love for pizza. She also maybe has romantic feelings towards Lelouch along with a few other supporting characters. There is still a lot we don't know about her past, so hopefully we’ll learn more about it in R2.\nSuzaku Kururugi:\nAn old friend of Lelouch and a Britannian soldier. He thinks that he can change the world and the way people think from within, but is completely hypocritical. He disapproves of Zero’s methods, but he doesn;t seem to have a problem killing his enemies on the battlefield, especially when something happens to a certain someone. I honestly kind of hate him, his has an air of superiority to him, like he’s above Lelouch even though they are achieving there goals in pretty similar manners.\nAnimation/ Art Style: 6/10\nIt’s seriviceable. Sometimes the worst thing to be is average, especially since it’s hard to come up with adjectives to describe your opinion on the topic. the characters are pretty generic, the only one that really sticks out to me is C.C. probably because of her hair color. The Mech fights are exciting, though I get lost as to what’s happening at times. There just isn’t very much excellent or terrible animation wise, honestly sometime the series looks like it came from the late 90’s to early 00’s.\nSound: 5/10\nThere is a wide variety of musical genres utilized to fit the different tones conveyed, it’s a pretty generic description, fitting for my overall memory of the music throughout the series. Again The OP and EP are alright, you can call them songs. That is something right?... hello?... Yeah, this series does nothing for me music wise, but it doesn’t piss me off either, so it is middle of the road fodder in my eyes.\nEnjoyment: 9/10\nThe story is action packed, and it plays like a game of chess. With each battle being as strategic as the last. Most episodes end with a cliffhanger leaving you starved for the next turn. I feel like though it gets more epic and grandiose as the war rages it, it also adds new characters and new geass that frustrate more than they help. It’s a complex and messy show that shouldn't be taken too seriously, and you go into this show knowing this ahead of time I’m sure you’ll find some enjoyment in it.\nOverall:\n7/10\n        "},

With its fantastic characters, interesting setting and brilliant strategy elements, \"Code Geass\" is an amazing story about how far one will go to change the world and is absolutely a 'must-see'.\nStory & World (9.5/10):\n\"Code Geass\" is set in an alternate timeline where the world is controlled by three superpowers: the Britannian Empire, the European Union and the Chinese Federation and takes place seven years after the Britannians have conquered the Japanese (or as people now call them \"Elevens\"). At the centre of the plot is our anti-hero Lelouch vi Britannia, an former prince who was exiled by his father to Japan with his disabled sister Nunnally and is determined to one day seek vengeance on his country and make the world a better place for his sister. One day, after getting caught up in a terrorist attack, Lelouch has the key to his goal handed to him on a silver platter- Geass, a mysterious power that is best described as affecting the minds of others- in Lelouch's case, it gives him the ability to control people's minds. With this power and his cunning, Lelouch soon forms a group called the Black Knights in order to end the Emperor's tyrannical rule once and for all.\nSome may dismiss \"Code Geass\" as a mecha anime but that really isn't the case. It's actually just a military anime that just happens to have mechs in it. The focus of the battles in the series is strategy, not mechs and the show can go for several episodes at a time without any mech battles at all. You may think that having the ability to control people's actions and wills makes Lelouch invincible but the truth is anything but as his Geass has plenty of limitations, such as only working once on each person. As a result, Lelouch has to rely on a lot more than Geass and thankfully he's an expert at manipulation and tactics, but even then he still loses or fails quite a few times.\nThe story is brilliant- as the plot develops it shows Lelouch gradually facing the consequences of his actions and how they affect those around him. The setting is also quite unique- while alternate timelines have been done before, this could very well be the best one I've seen. Sure, there is the occasional hiccup (did anyone like the infamous deus ex machina in reverse?), but overall the story is really compelling and kept me hooked to the end. And speaking of which, I'd also like to say this has easily one of the best endings to an anime I have yet to see.\nArt and Animation (9/10):\n\"Code Geass\" overall looks really good. The characters and environments are well drawn and the effects are fantastic. While there is fanservice, it's not particularly noticeable and never shove-in-your-face. Sometimes, however, the character models can look really weird when up close when you see how oddly skinny they look as well as the strange noses. The textures can also be quite dull at times. These don't keep the art from being solid but they can be distracting.\nSound & Dialogue (9/10):\nThe soundtrack is good, but not outstanding. It fits the series, but it tends to just blend in to the background most of the time. The opening and ending themes are quite good but not exactly memorable. Nevertheless, there are some really good tracks to be found here, especially in the last few episodes. The real attraction here, however, is the voice acting. The dub features a brilliant cast including Johnny Yong Bosch, Yuri Lowenthal, Karen Strassman and Crispin Freeman and they give nothing less than their usual energy. The dialogue is also fantastic, with the most noteworthy line being said three times in the series by Lelouch himself and is pretty much the lesson of the entire show: \"The only ones who should kill are those who are prepared to be killed.\"\nYeah, I could go on forever listing how many villains should have learned that lesson before going on a crazed rampage.\nCharacters (9.5/10):\nThe characters are amazing. I could go all day explaining why I love them but I'll just keep it simple. For a cast that pretty much consists of anti-heroes and villains (not including all the neutral characters), there is an awful lot of diversity to be found here. The amount of character development is the series is huge- some characters you hated at first you may like by the end and vice-versa, though the latter isn't exactly a good thing. \nWe'll take a look at the main characters: Suzaku, for example, is the best friend of Lelouch but also works for the Britannians despite the fact that they dominated his country. He comes off as a hypocrite and a horrible judge of character but the last few episodes may just change your opinion of him. There's also Kallen, a member of the Black Knights and pretty much Lelouch's powerhouse. While she's not the best character in the series in my opinion, she is definitely the most badass and there are no less than two scenes where she's naked but not unarmed (you read that right). Another noteworthy character is Lelouch's little sister, Nunnally. While not exactly a protagonist, she is pretty much Lelouch's motivation for making the world a better place as he wishes for her to be happy. For someone who can't see or walk, she is hardly ever in a bad mood and is painfully sweet and huggable. It really is no wonder Lelouch loves her so much.\nMy favourite characters, however, are Lelouch himself and C.C., the mysterious woman who gave him his powers. I consider Lelouch in particular to be the ultimate definition of an anti-hero as far as anime go. The first episode alone establishes him as the chessmaster, the guy who will get his hands dirty to help a stranger without a second thought, the genius who appears to have an encyclopaedia jammed in his brain and the well-intentioned extremist he's about to become. He is also far from your average terrorist in that he's fully aware of the kind of person he is. While he is determined to destroy Britannia, he never has any delusions that he's doing the right thing. He even outright admits to being a hypocrite several times. Over the series, he develops a huge guilt complex which, if I were to explore in detail, would spoil the entire show. He always sticks to the quote I mentioned above and is perfectly willing to face the consequences for his actions at any given time. However, this does not stop him from ever giving up. C.C. is also really compelling and loved her very nearly as much as I did Lelouch. She may come across as very serious, but she has several odd quirks such as her fascination with pizza. She also has a very complicated backstory and the episodes that explore this are some of my favourite in the series. She is also the only character in the series who can match Lelouch word-for-word, and the banter between them is easily some of the best in the series. \nThe villains in the series leave a little to be desired, as many of them don't get as much screentime as they could have or have very convoluted plots, the Emperor included. One guy is made out to be Lelouch's worst possible enemy only to be killed off a few episodes later. However, I've always liked heroes a lot more than I do villains so this didn't bother me that much. Of course, for villain enthusiasts, this could certainly prove to be a problem.\nEnjoyment (10/10):\nI looked back over the series quite recently and I was amazed by the incredible amount of re-watch value the series had. I was never once bored during the series and it was never too much to handle. There were always some great surprises and the end left me truly satisfied. Long story short, I can say that I easily enjoyed it all.\nOverall:\n\"Code Geass\" is one of the best animes I've seen so far. It's got great set-pieces, fantastic character development and a very compelling and touching story with a truly perfect ending, as well as (in my opinion) the greatest anti-hero anime has ever given us. I would highly recommend this series to everyone, especially those who are looking for a show that will really get them into anime. Just don't expect every anime to match the standards of this one.\nScore:\n9.5+9+9+9.5+10=47/50=9.4/10\n        "},

A catchy song and awesome animation that really compliment each other!!\nReason why i love this anime is the Character development of the Protagonist Lelouch. He wants\n          \n        to change the empire for a better living for him and his sister with the power of Geass he attains from forming a contract with a Green haired Babe called C.C (C2). He is the leader of a Japanese rebellious group, he hides his face and goes by the name Zero. There's also great character development of supporting characters like his long friend Suzaku and His Classmates. Lelouch balances his between being a rebellious leader and a part of his schools student council trying to avoid getting any of his friends involved with his dark secret.\nThroughout the entire series i was always on the edge of my seat. I even marathoned through the series because i just had to know what was going to happen in the next episode. Not like it matter though because there'd be some crazy plot twist that you didn't see coming!! Just when you thought you saw it all the Anime throws you a curve ball and leaves you in awe!!\nAlso the tactical and strategic thinking process that Lelouch does is outstanding and the Anime does very well explaining to the viewer as to how some things happened. \nThere is also some entertaining Mech battles in it aswell!!\nand also there's a great deal of Fan Service !!\n\n"},

			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=7, ["text"]="\n                          \n    With Code Geass being the second anime I had ever seen and having my friend bother me for a week to watch it, I was actually amazed. Of course, it had been one of my favourite anime- but I felt that nostalgia made it seem better than it was. And boy was I wrong... This anime is better than what I remembered it to be.\nIf you want to know whether to watch it, then definitely do. I don't dislike mecha anime, but neither do I like them. As a matter of fact, I've only managed to fully watch 3 mecha anime in my life. This\n          \n        means a lot, as a genre that I avoid watching actually turned out to be one of my favourite anime.\nThe story revolves around the anti-hero, Lelouch, who makes a contract with a mysterious woman and gets the power to command anyone with one thing. With the use of his charisma, wits, and power, he decides to take over the empire. Having this as a story is fairly interesting. I mean, the main character is practically trying to take over the world by manipulating others. It isn't the best storyline, but it definitely is good.\nThe art is actually really good, even when compared to today's anime. I'm not saying it' better than today's anime, but it was definitely better than what was available in the past.\nThe sound/music of the anime is outstanding. Probably my favourite part of the anime. The openings, ending, and even the music in the episodes was great. When you heard a soundtrack, you knew something was going to happen- even during the extra scenes of them doing almost nothing. The sound majorly improved everything. This is surprising, since I usually tend to either skin the openings/endings and not pay much attention to the background music.\nLastly, the characters deserve a high rating. There was a character that would suit almost everyone. Luckily, this does not include the cliche annoying characters that you would expect to see in poorly written anime. And as mentioned before, it holds probably my favourite anti-hero from anime- Lelouch vi Britannia.\n\nThanks for reading this review. It's not great, since it is my first (didn't want to put it at the start of the review so people don't act to be nice to me out of pity).\n        "},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=7, ["text"]="\n                          \n    At first, I thought it would just be one of those nerdy animes with robots and no story, but wow, I got proven wrong when I saw the first episode. Code Geass is much more.\nStory~\nThis is about a young, teen boy in the distant future named Lelouch, who is on his way in being 17th prince in line for Britannia. In the future, Britannia has raided Japan with new robotic technology, and left it to be nothing more than something called Area 11. Lelouch is disgusted by his father's actions, but is even more horrified to find that his mother had been killed. His sister,\n          \n        in shock, loses her eyesight, and ends up getting shot, crippiling her.\nAfter learning of all this, Lelouch decides to speak up against his father. In doing so, he is banished for Britannia and sent to Area 11 with his sister. Outraged, Lelouch wants to do something, but does not know how he could. Days pass, and he grows bored of life. But then, on his way to school, he actually gets nabbed by Japanese terrorists. He becomes surrounded by Britannian soldiers and fears that this is the end. In the crowd of soldiers he notices his childhood friend Suzaku. He speaks up against Lelouch, but not being a pureblooded Britannian, ends up angering the leader. Suzaku is suspected of being a terrorist like Lelouch, and now, they both fear it is the end. But then, something in the terrorist's truck jumps out and a green-haired girl named C.2 comes and blocks Lelouch. She is shot, but gives Lelouch a strange power that allows him to control the minds of others. With his new found power, Lelouch orders all the soldiers to commit suicide, while Suzaku has escaped. With the power of the geass, Lelouch and C.2 hope to create a better place for Japan, and for his little sister.\nArt~\nThe art is nice and vibrant, but, in my opinion, the guys look a little too thin.  This didn't bother me much because it was still really nice, but it was the weakest point in the anime.\nSound~\nSound is in the correct places, and, like Death Note, dramatic scenes are really made...dramatic.  I liked the theme songs/endings for the most part and overall, it was nice. \nCharacters~\nThough slow at first, Lelouch learns to become a strong leader even though it's out of wanting revenge on his father.  He also wants to help his sister which softens him up slightly in this case.  His comrades also develop as well by following Lelouch and the enemies learn to be trickier.  Lelouch must keep up with his enemies and they must keep up with him.  The development speeds up at the end of the series and in R2.\nEnjoyment~\nThis anime was very enjoyable as it had plenty of explosions, romance, violence, and strategy.\nOverall~\nOverall, I really liked this anime which puts it at #3 on my top 10 animes.   \n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    first off I would like to say that this anime blew my mind, the very first episode that I saw didn't really stand out much it just seemed like a gundam clone. Then came the ending of that first episode, it was the first in a long line of twist each one better than the other. finally leading up to an epic cliffhanger ending.\nstory- This story is definetly for the intellectual type, the main character lelouche is a genius teenager who, when you get down to the bare bone, is out for revenge. Beyond that just the way that the story is set up with\n          \n        the interactions between the characters is astonishing. And the irony, there is so much irony, and seeing when the characters are revealed the truth is absolutly mindblowing. Over all the story is one to remember and one that really needs to be experienced first hand.\nart- Well this is my one complaint, while I do like that the art is stylized to fit its own story, its rather cartoony. It seems to be a trait that Clamp has to elongate the limbs, and personally I don't much care for that. But beyond that the mechs look superb and the fight scenes are done beautifully.\nsound- The OP and ED songs to the first 12 episodes fit very nicely to the overall feel of the show. Also the sounds throughout the series fit well with the tone of what was going on. Though the OP song to the second half of the series seemed kind of out of place and didn't match the animations all that well. For the most part, though, I enjoyed the music.\ncharacter- I could go on and on about how amazing all of the characters are, some more than others though. I will try and limit myself though, it seems like there is something for every one in this department. The characters span a wide range of total jerk, to sweet princess, to someone you love to hate, to someone you just feel sorry for. All of the characters actions and interactions are absolutly amazing, and probably the best part about the show.\nI would absolutly recommend this to any one who has ever watched any thing on TV, this is a stunning series and deserves to be so.

Decide if you want to give this anime a try after you read the entire review. You may add it as your favorite or hate it with your entire soul and body!\n•Story: How many of you liked death note? Why? Because at some point you get that death note feeling. You know! The one where a guy has a super natural power that nobody but him and the one who gave him the power know\n          \n        about. And he tries to change the word, but there's this one guy who thinks they are friends when in fact they are enemies, etcetera etcetera. \n           This show is death note, only with a more childish sound to it, and worst twists and plot.\n•Art: The art was great, can't complain about much on that level, it's a matter of taste.\n•Sound: The sound had it's ups and downs, but it didn't stand out as great, neither did it disappoint.\n•Characters: Oh boy... This is where things really started to go downfall... the death note plot... yeah I can deal with it... but the characters, different story. \n The fact that you get attached to a character for 12 episodes, and he is taken out in the most horrific way possible, and forgotten after only 1 episodes of their death, yeah that freaking pisses me off. It's like they didn't matter at all!\n            The characters also suffer way to fast/dramatic changes! They go from right to left and from left to right in a matter of 3 minutes.\n•Enjoyment: Until the middle of the series I quite enjoyed the series. It had some drama, a little bit of slice of life, some romance, it definitely had action and enough comedy to keep things cool. I found myself more than once very moved by certain events. \n             Now this is where the crap stars! Keep in mind this is enjoyment not the story/art/sound or any other section. So, I'm at the final episodes, everything is going steady, something just pops out of nowhere that looks like it's going to end the series with a little bit of drama, but it will all end up in a good way. It's that type of happy ending, where you know some stuff is gonna happen before you get to it, but it's obvious it's gonna come and it's gonna be good. And as I expected, it came, everything was very good, a 4/5 star ending, beautiful. But then! Everything gets turned 360 degrees! Because of a stupid mistake, and no I don't mean a well calculated, well placed, well timed mistake, I mean DOWN RIGHT STUPID, OUTRAGEOUSLY STUPID, mistake that changes everything and ensures the most, rage worthy ending!\n•Overall: Watch the show, you might find it very entertaining, it has some very good episodes that really stand out, but as I said, the ending screws up, big freaking time! And the second season is just an excuse to drag. As mentioned at the top, you might love it, you might hate it. I know I did."},
			{["score"]=5, ["helpful"]=7, ["text"]="                          \n    Oh boy, what I can say about the beloved Code Geass anime? Well, I can pretty much tell you that I was hoping for something really good, but then I ended up very dissapointed mid-way through the season (this review is for R1 only)\nThis anime kicked ass when it first started. It had a seemingly good plot with a good character. One that was hell bent on having revenge, going so far as to kill off his own half siblings. Not to mention the cool power of geass. I really wanted to see Lelouch slowly bring Britinia down to its knees and watch him acheive\n          \n        his goal throughout the show.\nSadly, the anime turned rotten about halfway through. Idk why, but by the time I was already on episode 15 or so, I realized that this anime went by fast. Too fast. Things just didn't seem right. Infact, the pacing was completely fucked. Things were going by way too fast, one minute we are attacking something and the next we are doing something else with little to no explanation. Plus there was just too much shit going on. We had all these things going on over the series and we only see them bit by bit in each episode or something. The awful pacing and the overload of random crap were the two main downfalls for this series.\nThings also began to get really repetitive, half the episodes were the same shit. Black Knights attack, Cornellia fights them, Zero almost acheives his goal, Suzaku shows up, Zero's plans get fucked up, Black Knights retreat to fight another day (and repeat the whole bullshit all over again). \nAm I going to watch R2? Maybe, maybe not. The only reason I am considering watching the second season is because of of the HUGE cliffhanger ending, which is tearing at my soul.\nThis series was overall dissapointing and does not deserve all the 10's it gets on MAL. Seriously? What do people see in this crap? This is defiantly another overrated anime with a LARGE fanbase (which really makes me wonder why so many people give it such HIGH ratings when it has so many flaws).\n"},

Turns out it was hehe. I would have to say this anime deserved all the actual awards it received and the score I gave them. This is because from the Story to the Enjoyment level of\n          \n        the series, it was at a constant high.\nSo...without further ado, I'm sure you'd like to read about the details, instead of me waffling and wasting your time...\nStory: A rather perplexing story I have to say. Not that I'm giving you any spoilers ( I hope), but this is one of the rare anime that I find that has a rather sad ending. However you view what Lelouch does, it can be a happy/sad ending. Anyways, from the first episode, I thought the explaining was very thorough and somewhat plausible. Therefore, the story is something that a viewer of this series should be seriously paying attention to. I promise you that you'll love the plot of this series and it won't disappoint you.\nArt: I personally found the art to be pretty detailed, something you should expect in a series that features cool mechas. Nothing really here to complain about as a top-notch series like this shouldn't have any art errors present.\nSound: I really liked the opening and ending themes of this series. Not that it stuck in my head the first time i listened to it, but it was somewhat addictive. The soundtrack itself was fit perfectly according to the tension at a certain moment. Subarashii!!!\nCharacter: As the same quality as the story, i found the characters to be very well developed and I didn't have to use wikipedia to gain further knowledge on certain characters. The characters themselves also seem to have plausible personalities and were very well scripted as well as the casting was kanpeki desu!\nEnjoyment: I cannot express how appalled I was after completing on 7/12/2010.

			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=4, ["text"]="                          \n    Code Geass! R1! This was quite an intense anime, I don't think I've seen anything this intense since possibly Evangelion or something around there. It's a very aggressive thing and kind of gets pretty crazy at times but at the same time I liked different parts of it so.. here we go. \nCode Geass is basically about the story of Japan during an era of rule by a country that is very powerful and rules over a lot of the world, and Japan has a lot of conflicts within itself and outside.. it's basically not the best time, you could say... \nIn the middle of\n          \n        this, Japan rebels and is defeated, and this is where Lelouch Lamperouge, the central character in Code Geass, comes in..\nInterestingly, Lelouch is actually not from Japan but a prince, but a very low level one, who came to Japan with his sister Nunally. There, he makes friends with Suzaku, the son of the prime minister of Japan and this is kind of the main backstory for Code Geass, the story of Code Geass is really one of Lelouch (and intermittenly) Suzaku's kind of rebellion in order to make Japan a more independent country against Lelouch and Nunally's original country and their father. \nLelouch was kind of interesting to me because he was seemingly often apathetic but then at times would be fairly nice and cool to be around simultaneously, like he was kind of very hot and cold type of personality, although you definitely frequently saw the cold and dark side. \nSo that's a lot of the backstory, but a lot of tha tin Code Geass tells you about the rest of the anime as well, and there are indeed a lot of points along that trip, trials and tribulations for all parties, to say the least... \n..but the odd thing I can never really shake off is how similar Lelouch was in many ways to his father and the other country he came from, in many ways everything he did within his organization was similar to how it was done in his other country.\nThe thing is everytime Lelouch would be mean and freak out and blame someone for this or that, you could see like dealing with just his crush on Shirley you can see a more just kind of straightforwardly human side, so I kept watching. \nThen.. wow.. I think up until very near the ending, I thought Lelouch and his friends were at least kind of interesting, maybe not always likable.. but it often seemed like they were somehow trying to find a way to make amends with their rulers so as to have like a better life and there was a lot of conflict, and they weren't always doing things so well, and things weren't always going so well, and it wasn't still my favorite anime at that point mind you it was still just kind of not fun, BUT I think a like a low 8 is pretty good for R1, because it did kind of engage me, and you did see some nicer sides to the characters and stuff. \nHowever, R2 is completely different, and part of the reason comes at the very end of R1, which for spoiler and others reasons, I think should just be a part of \"R2\" which wow R2 was no fun at all, because without spoiling too much everything kind of flies off the rails in the last part, and that continues off into R2 which was really just not very fun to watch. \nBecause of all that, I was tempted to make Code Geass R1 like a lower score, but it came basically so far at the end I thought it was better to just lump that in with R2. \nSo even though R1 kind of ended strangely, I was still ok with it being like an 7, it wasn't my favorite anime, but it was kind of interesting at least if not necessarily fun at times. \nAnyway! Phew, long review, but you know another thing is I think in terms of more gray kind of characters I still prefer like D from Vampire Hunter D, and so on, just because I feel like if you subtract out a lot of the political stuff Lelouch isn't super different from D it seems to me at the core. \nOn the other hand, I watched another kind of politically heavy anime Legend of the Galactic Heroes, which featured another kind of tortured figure in Reinhard Von Lohengramm, and honestly I'd have to say I'd probably prefer CG to LotGH, primarily because I feel like LotGH was kind of jarring at times with how screwy things get , I don't really know how to phrase it or summarize as a point here exactly but CG seemed to emanate more power a bit. \nAnd in the interests of explaining the big thing about R1 and R2 I'll go with the spoilers past this point. \n(SPOILERS FOR end of R1/R2)\nUm I should totally write a separate review for R2 for this, but all I can say is that ending make like NO sense to me jeez his whole \"All the hatred is focused on me\" was a total cop out excuse there was no way that was the plan, because I mean one of the things that happened in R1 was the Geass malfunctioned when there was peace with Euphemia, and then it's like everything went wrong and all that happened was a bunch of excuses blegh I'd give R2 a 6 but even that's being generous it might honestly be like a 5 or 4. \nEven that whole malfunction thing was screwy I don't know it just kinda started to tear apart and I was like yikes this is crazy, but as this is overall a review for most of R1, I don't think R1 should be low for that. \n"},

The writing for this show is some of the most brilliant I've seen in any medium, the character relationships, the complex geopolitics and philosophical dilemmas are so incredibly engaging and inspiring as a writer I can't bring myself to see it as anything less than a\n          \n        masterpiece.\nThe show asks some of the hardest questions a human being can ever be forced to try answering.

Can good people do evil deeds, is there even such a thing as purely good or evil? Is it best to keep peace through forced submission, or allow freedom and the horrors that come from the greed that it breeds? \nThis show is heavier than Thor's freaking hammer and I love it for that beyond words. It's not often that a piece of artwork so well produced and constructed is willing to challenge an audience on so many intellectual and emotional levels.

The characters here are uniquely drawn - they're quite lean, except the occasional fat ones, but Lelouch and his friends and enemies are for the most part pretty slim. The hair is also unique.

Before getting to the actual review, I want to say don't think you can watch Code Geass without also watching Code Geass R2, the two seasons needs to be watched together to get the full effect.\nStory 10/10: This lost prince isn't trying to find his way back home, he's trying to obliterate his homeland. The plot may seem very straightforward, and it is for the most part, but there will always be a twist; the good thing about this though is that the twist\n          \n        is always completely within the realm of possibility. You'll feel smarter and more diabolical just for watching the first two episodes, once I watched those, I was hooked for life. P.S. if you think this is a mecha anime about the mechas, please start over.\nArt 10/10: I almost feel compelled to lower this score because of the string bean character designs and unnecessarily busty string beans, but the design of the -special- Knightmares (mechas) is just too great, and the fight scenes are excellent.\nSound 10/10: Catchy theme songs and always perfect mood music for what's going on.\nCharacter 10/10: If you think you have all the main characters figured out after the first couple episodes, stop yourself there, and then keep watching without that thought in your mind. I may be making this sound like they all make life changing reveals, but that's not necessarily the case, though you will get insight into their motives and personality, so just keep watching. If you think there are some characters that are underdeveloped, remember one of the top rules of anime: pay attention to the characters with hair that stands out. After that, if you still think they are underdeveloped, watch R2.\nEnjoyment 10/10: I've watched Code Geass and Code Geass R2 at least 10 times each, of course I enjoyed it. \nOverall 10/10: If anyone is willing to watch any series suggested by me regardless of the episode count (since 12-13 episode series are the new standard), I will always, ALWAYS recommend Code Geass.\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I'm going to start this by saying that I came into this show with a handful of experience with the manga. When I first saw it, I thought that it was going to be a horrible adaptation but I'm glad that I decided to continue with what is now my favourite anime series. Also on a side note, I am a big Jun Fukuyama fanboy, and love everything I have seen him in. Getting into the grit of things:\nStory: Code Geass tells an incredible story, complete with wonderful and in-depth world-building that is not pure exposition. It's the type of story where if you are\n          \n        thinking really intricately and analytically as you watch, you can begin to predict Lelouch's next move, only to be shown that it was actually MUCH more intricate and thought out, and just damn cooler than what you could have hoped for. This delivers a perfect mixture of laughs, tears and moments of awesomeness, deserving a perfect score. 10/10.\nArt: Although this anime is of an older variety (in comparison to a lot of the popular ones now), and it was not as well animated in some aspects as shows from the same time period, such as Death Note or in some aspects Kuroshitsuji, but it has definitely aged well, and never lapses in quality like some other anime with better animations. 9/10.\nSound: The OST is incredible in this, being one of the few series where I bothered to buy the full OST, but I do have a few grievances with the second OP and ED. Giving it a 9/10 on that.\nCharacter: These characters are VERY in-depth as are their interactions, backstory is revealed systematically between characters and it does not go overboard on either exposition or flashbacks (like other anime), none of it feels forced, and some of these scenes contain some of the best voice acting I have heard. Along with the great choices in cast, even without counting Lelouch's, we have some of the best and most diverse, in my opinion, VA's we could have gotten, 10/10.\nEnjoyment: This show was a rollercoaster to watch, and I enjoyed every second of it, twists and turns, laughing or crying, Lelouch or Suzaku. I have rewatched this anime, and it does not seem to ever get old, 10/10.\nOverall: As an overall score, I don't think I can go below 10/10. It is in my eyes, one of the most perfect anime series I have ever seen and I do not think that there are many things I can say about it that are bad. There are a few plot holes, but those are usually minor and only made obvious when you search in detail. I encourage anyone that was a fan of Death Note, or things in a similar vein, anyone who likes strategy or mecha to watch this. I do not usually like mechas, but this is an exception, 10/10 overall score.\n        "},
			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=2, ["text"]="                          \n    - English Review (Translated version)\nWhen you write a review, it is difficult to find a balance between the quality of the product and the impression it has caused you. I mean, really doing something individual should have a good dose of subjectivity, but being honest is not fair also not take into account the virtues and defects objectively. That is why achieving a harmony between both is often a difficult task.\nOf all the anime I've seen, with the most I've felt this is with \"Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch\". And with a lot of difference. \"Code Geass\" is, quite simply, a military history, full of\n          \n        combat and strategy. Of course it is not my favorite genre (at least in anime), but if you add a main role to \"mechas\" during the battles, my interest goes even lower.\nThe fact is that otherwise, the series is practically perfect, outstanding and brilliant in all aspects that can be taken into consideration objectively. And here is where I wanted to reach with this speech: subjectively the topic does not appeal to me, but objectively after seeing the series I can say its quality is superlative. So looking for a balance between both, because the review is basically mine but I also like to be fair when I write, I have scored it with a 8.\nThe story is one of the strengths of \"Code Geass\" (although I would be hard to find a weak one). It is deep, it is convoluted, full of nuances and at the same time it is catching you as the episodes finished because everything is clarifying at the same time complicating with new storylines and/or plot scripts (which there are and also very good). Curious is the detail of the parallelism of the beginning of history with what happened in Japan during World War II. Tribute or criticism, I found it an interesting point to do so within the fantasy of the other elements.\nDuring the history they are involved multitude of characters, a tremendously high number. Well, I always say and I defend that an anime knows how to manage and make its characters, secondary included, already has many livestock. This is the case here. Leaving aside the leading role of Lelouch, which is obvious (although I personally think he's not a big deal), the robust base of \"Code Geass\" is built on solid and charismatic characters.\nNamed already Lelouch I could continue with Kallen, Suzaku, C.C, Cornelia, Euphie, Ohgi, Shirley... the list is practically infinite and I still leave many names: Cecil, Nunnally, Jeremiah, Villetta, Lloyd... I think there is still clear that the lack of good characters can not be blamed. Best of all is that they are not padding roles, with exceptions, they all have some kind of important appearance in the plot and that is what makes the work of the screenwriters so great in terms of characters. Even a character who should be totally inconsequential (nor human to begin with) as the cat Arthur has a key moment.\nThe music is completely great. A soundtrack that can be considered a true masterpiece. The instrumental melodies that sound during the episodes are magnificent and apart from that they are embedded in the action of perfect form giving more power to the decisive scenes. Seriously, probably the best performed ever in Japanese animation. I would have loved that the openings (yes, up to three different in only 25 episodes...) and the endings were up to this, but they did not reach the level of \"ambient music\". I choose as my favorites the first opening for its rhythm (and claim that the third opening is horrible) and with the second ending for its wonderful lyrics.\nWeak points? Objectively... nothing, to say something the fact it is a first season and the story does not conclude. Nothing that can not be fixed, there is only to begin the second season after. If you have not seen it, you are already late, you will enjoy it very much. And if you are a fan of \"mechas\" you will enjoy it twice.\nPS: Does anyone want to order Pizza Hut?\n\n- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)\nCuando uno escribe una crítica (review) sobre cualquier cosa es complicado encontrar un equilibrio entre la calidad del producto en sí y la impresión que te ha causado a ti mismo. Quiero decir, realmente al ser algo individual debería tener una buena dosis de subjetividad, pero siendo sinceros no es justo tampoco no tener en cuenta las virtudes y defectos de forma objetiva. Es por eso que lograr una armonía entre ambos se suele antojar una tarea difícil.\nDe todos los anime que he visto hasta el momento, con el que más he notado esto que comento es con \"Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch\". Y además con muchísima diferencia. \"Code Geass\" es, simplificando bastante, una historia militar, repleta de combates y estrategia. De por sí no es que ése sea mi género predilecto (al menos en anime), pero si a eso le añades el protagonismo cuasiabsoluto de los \"mecha\" durante las batallas, para mí pierde aún más interés porque no me atrae para nada esa temática.\nEl caso es que por lo demás, la serie es prácticamente perfecta, sobresaliente y brillante en todos los aspectos que se puedan tener en consideración de forma objetiva. Y es aquí donde quería llegar con todo esta perorata que estoy soltando: subjetivamente la temática no me atrae, pero objetivamente después de ver la serie puedo decir que su calidad es superlativa. Así que buscando un equilibrio entre ambas cosas, ya que la review es básicamente mía pero también me gusta ser justo cuando escribo, la he puntuado con un 8. Esto en general, luego también hay detalles que complementan esta justificación, pero de esto hablaré después de esta introducción que quería dejar clara antes de todo.\nLa historia es uno de los puntos fuertes de \"Code Geass\" (aunque me costaría encontrar uno débil). Es profunda, es enrevesada, repleta de matices y a la vez te va atrapando conforme pasan los capítulos porque todo se va aclarando a la vez que complicando con nuevas tramas y/o giros de guión (que los hay y además muy buenos). Curioso el detalle del paralelismo del inicio de la historia con lo ocurrido en Japón durante la II Guerra Mundial. Homenaje o crítica, me pareció un punto interesante el hacerlo así dentro de lo fantasioso de los demás elementos.\nDurante la historia se ven involucrados multitud de personajes, un número tremendamente alto. Bien, siempre digo y defiendo que un anime que sabe gestionar y hacer actuar a sus personajes, secundarios incluidos, ya tiene mucho ganado. Éste es el caso aquí. Dejando a un lado el protagonismo de Lelouch, que es obvio (aunque a mí personalmente no me parece para tanto, llamadme loco...), la robusta base de \"Code Geass\" se construye sobre unos personajes sólidos, carismáticos y con los que se empatiza constantemente.\nNombrado ya Lelouch podría continuar con Kallen, Suzaku, C.C, Cornelia, Euphie, Ohgi, Shirley... la lista es prácticamente infinita y aún me dejo muchísimos nombres: Cecil, Nunnally, Jeremiah, Villetta, Lloyd... Creo que ha quedado claro que la falta de buenos personajes no se le puede achacar. Lo mejor de todo es que no simplemente están de relleno, salvo excepciones, todos tienen algún tipo de aparición importante en la trama y eso es lo que hace tan genial el trabajo de los guionistas en cuanto a personajes. Fíjate si lo hacen bien, que hasta un personaje que debería ser totalmente intrascendente (ni es humano para empezar) como el gato Arthur tiene un momento clave.\nLa música es complemente genial. Una banda sonora que se puede considerar una verdadera obra maestra. Las melodías instrumentales que suenan durante los capítulos son magníficas y aparte de ello están incrustadas en la acción de forma perfecta dando aún más potencia a las escenas decisivas. En serio, probablemente de las mejores realizadas nunca en la animación japonesa. Me hubiera encantado que los openings (sí, hasta tres diferentes en 25 capítulos...) y los endings estuvieran a la altura de esto, pero no alcanzan el nivel de la \"música ambiente\". No es que sean malos ni mucho menos, pero es que ésta alcanza cotas altísimas difíciles de igualar. Me quedo con el primer opening por su ritmo (y reivindico que el tercero es horrible) y con el segundo ending por su maravillosa letra.\n¿Puntos débiles? Subjetivamente lo ya comentado al inicio de mi review, objetivamente... nada, por nombrar algo que al ser una primera temporada la historia no concluye y te deja con ganas de más. Nada que no se pueda arreglar, no hay más que comenzar la segunda temporada después. Si no la has visto, ya estás tardando, la vas a disfrutar muchísimo. Y si además eres fanático de los \"mechas\" la disfrutarás doblemente.\nPD: ¿A nadie le apetece hacer un pedido al Pizza Hut?\n        "},

While initially appearing not the most original story, the character development and the philosophical context blow away the rest of dramatic anime. It is truly a masterpiece by most standards, but there are few who don't enjoy it as much. This is because it is almost perfect from a critical view, not an entertainment view.\nThe show represents a somewhat modern take on good vs. evil, with a realistic spin in that there is no real good influencing the story. While intentions are good for the most part, evil is ever present and perhaps even\n          \n        necessary. This simple contradiction provides the basis for the conflict of the story, and its resolution ultimately. This anime is perhaps the most influential on those who question the correctness of their own actions or those of other by that contraction as well. \nAdditionally, its themes of actions, relations, and power become focal points of the character's minds. This fact is what makes the story so emotionally moving- that its characters are going beyond the lines and becoming thinking beings in themselves. This likely arises from a deep connection to the philosophy presented in the show in its writer, while personalities they know well are implemented alongside.\nFinally, the show is constantly changing in struggle and direction; however, when one looks upon earlier phases of its story, they see it move in the general direction of forward. In the midst of it all, however, constant changes represent an impossible struggle which effects the main character Lelouch in a multitude of ways. Specifically, he becomes more and more human while taking someone along with him down said path.\nBeing one of Sunrise's best, it is a must watch for any fan of anime or any fan of entertainment.\n        "},
			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=6, ["text"]="                          \n    In all honesty this show, which I'm writing specifically about the first season, has a compelling core story with side venues to ensure it never gets too serious/stale. The season revolves around a teenager named Lelouch who is trying to recreate the world for the sake of his younger sister, Nannally, and also to get revenge on the people that killed his mother. In the course of the first couple episodes he inherits a power that allows him to control the people around him. This power, which is called a Geass, has a host of conditionals attached to it. Lelouch must have direct eye contact\n          \n        with the host (eyewear excluded), be within 250m, and most importantly can only order someone under the Geass once. There are other Geasses, but this is only explored with one other character named Mao. At its' core, it makes for an entertaining show about conflict and war, with some intrigue and politics factored in, and of course some giant machina and mecha thrown in for fun. \nSTORY 8/10\nIn an alternate universe, the Britannian Empire is the most powerful political entity with nearly 1/3 of the world's land mass. Japan was conquered and turned into 'Area 11,' subsequently its' people were called Elevens. In this area, there is a societal conflict that exists between the Britannians and the Elevens. Similar to how the Great Powers of Europe partitioned the world in the 18-19th centuries under the guise of Imperialism, the same situation is applied to Area 11. It was seen as colonized by the superior Britannians and developed into the economic entity it is today. However, the Elevens are treated as second-class citizens and are discriminated for simply being Elevens. \nLelouch, currently a student at Ashford Academy, inherits a power which enables him to control the people directly around him. Taking the persona of Zero, he launches a revolution with the sole focus to destroy Britannia, his father, and the people responsible for his mother's death. By destroying the old world, he can reconstruct it with true peace for his sister, Nannally.\nAnalyzing the main plot in-depth, the parts of the story that bothered me was the decisions the writers took to convenience the hell out of the storytelling. I swear it was almost as bad as a Korean soap opera with all the unnecessary plot twists that were thrown in, almost in an attempt to show people, \"Look I've got so many plot twists you can't trust ANYTHING about me, that makes me deep, right?\" The reality is, even though the story was tightly written, kinda.., I think they left a lot of open ends for a second season, it felt unnecessary at times. I guess it's a bit of a balance sometimes, you make a story as tight as possible by introducing a set amount of characters and you want to make a compelling explanation for extraordinary events in the plot but...so you choose to bring back characters, sometimes from the dead and other times from a different time/space, and bam problem solved. I'm not going to include any specific examples because they will be crucial spoilers.\nThere are additional storylines in conjunction with the core story. The second one is the school-scenario at Ashford Academy. Seriously, I thought the school-scenario was pretty lame, but it had its' necessary devices. It's very well possible that a Code Geass -sans school would actually be a problematic show. The school served to be...1, a convenient way to set the main characters in close proximity to each other to flesh out (anybody else noticed that there's only ONE high school in Japan!?), 2, convenient place for everyone to eat and enjoy Pizza Hut pizza...all for the sake of Cheese-kun :3 , 3, created a diversion from the seriousness of the main story, 4, created a type of alter-ego identity for Lelouch to live in...which of course created its' own complications with characters nosing around, and finally 5, this story was written primarily targeting junior/high school kids so it made it easier for the (target) audience to associate with the main characters. So I do hate this whole Ashford part of the plot, but I can see why they wrote it this way.\nThere is a third storyline, but it's only displayed or talked about briefly. This is the C.C./V.V. part of the tale, which was left a mystery throughout the whole season. Also note how LATE V.V. was introduced, it's a sure bet he was just staged for the next show. The only part of this storyline that intersects with the core story is with Lelouch receiving his power, Mao, and at the end. And to add, the Mao arc of the show was probably the most painful part...and he really didn't serve much for the overall storyline.\nART 9/10\nCLAMP's style is particular, honestly I'm not a major fan of the character design. Who really likes it, I'm not sure...the whole tall, skinny physique with abnormally long limbs? So why a 9? Because the show was well-animated, the action scenes and the character animations were all really done. You can tell that there was a lot of care put into it and made the show all the more entertaining to watch.\nSOUND 6/10\nThere are some good tracks, the OP/ED tracks used were all blood-pumping and fun to listen to...there were a couple tracks that were memorable, like the vocal track Stories//Hitomi. Overall, the tracks worked and did not detract from the show, however at the same time it was not memorable. If there's not a large amount of tracks that make me go, \"Oh man! I have to find out what this song is called!\" Then I usually think lower about the music. As far as the sound effects, they work, nothing unusual noted, but I don't usually factor sound effects heavily in a review.\nCHARACTER 9/10\nOh man, where to start! I really think Lelouch is an interesting character, there are some motivations that drive him that are unusual for a Japanese anime. The way that he affects the people around him, both with and without Geass, really struck a chord within my evaluation of him. His ability as a master strategist, explained by his expertise in chess, seemed reasonable. His rise as a leader of the Order of the Black Knights, was also well thought and I accepted it logically. He does possess a set of weaknesses too and this reinforces his reliance to strategically assess and manipulate others. Throw in a couple \"Oh sh-!\" scenes and you really start to believe in his ability to win this war. \nHis friend from a young age, Suzaku, is a Soldier with the Britannian Army but is also a student at the Ashford Academy (conveniently). He gradually becomes the main antagonist of the show, which I would say he started to take more-and-more of it away from Cornelia who at around the 20s started to lose significance in the story. He is also an ideal antagonist because he is in a lot of ways the antithesis of Lelouch. Lelouch is manipulative and strategically-proficient, Suzaku is strong, independent, and also tactically-proficient. The two have various complications because of the differing relationships they have between Suzaku and Lelouch AND Suzaku and Zero. His story is interesting, but I think it doesn't have the depth of Lelouch and initially his motivations are unbelievable.\nI won't get into it further than this, but the majority of the characters are interesting in their own ways. The strength of the show is around the characters and yes there are ridiculous ones, NINA especially, Mao...and a lot of the classmates at Ashford, but the vast majority are enjoyable to see interact.\nENJOYMENT 9/10\nThe characters are interesting, the plot good, and a healthy amount of action scenes. I watched the show within 3 days and there were rarely long periods of time where I had to stop and do something else. This means my attention was maintained for the most part. So I can say yes, it was enjoyable.\nOVERALL 8/10\nAn 8/10, a good show to watch, I know there is a fair amount of stigma around the show but it didn't affect my level of enjoyment. Don't confuse my review however, it's not a \"deep\" show and there are some crappy scenes, but for the most part it was fun to watch.\n        "},

			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=6, ["text"]="\n\nCode Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion starts off with a young student and his sister Nunnaly. Lelouch comes from a royal family, and has long since denounced it. Background goes like this; Eight years ago, Brittania took over the majoirty of the world, including Japan. Japan became known as Area 11, and its members known as Eleven's. Some members of the Japanese populace sought to become honorary Brittanian's so they may have rights, but others went to hiding, prefering to be japanese, though that term had been outlawed. Lelouch, member of the royal family and good friend to Suzaku, watched the discrimination with anger and\n          \n        horror, swearing to make the world a better place for his sister. He also swears vengeance against his father, the emperor of Brittania, for letting his mother die in the war. Lelouch is a brilliant young man, and is met by a woman, by the name of C2. C2 gives him a power, a Geass as they call it. This Geass is also refered to as 'the Power of Kings' and it has the ability to ultimately bend people's will to his own, regardless of outcome. This Geass helps him along with his plans, and to shape the future.\nThe Beginning: Lelouch watches as stolen semi passes by him and his friend, and crashes off of the road. He rushes down to see if they are ok, and gets caught in the back with this capsule. In the progressing scenes, this capsule opens to reveal C2, who forms a contract with him. This editor will not mention the terms of this contract, other than the fact this is how he gets his Geass. The thieves of the semi are a small group of radicals who want to liberate Japan from the rule of Brittania. They get into a fight with the Brittania government, and Lelouch watches from afar, giving them tactical advice, and leading the small team to both victory and profit, also managing to deliver them with a train of medications to take back and/or sell on the black market. This is how he ends up meeting Karen (english name). Karen and her group of rebels eventually form quite the task force, without ever meeting Lelouch.\nThe Middle to the end: Lelouch takes up a mask and calls himself Zero. He leads the rebels, but gives them a name, \"The Order of the Black Knights\" and refer to themselves as the ally's of justice. Throughout the story, they meet many other friends and ally's, and in time lose many. Again, this editor is trying not to give too much information away, as I do not want to spoil it for anyone. Zero and his troupe gain much notoriety in wars of not only violence, but of political and image as well. He has each planned laid out so well, that he never seems to be trumped, leading his group to victory time and time again. However, this all goes sour when the face of Zero is revealed (sorry) and the world turns on him, leading us into R2.\nBefore I go into R2, aside from the story arc I laid out for you, there is also something to be mentioned about battle sequences. Yes the dialogue is fantastic, and the story runs quite deep, but this is also an action anime, with the characters using something like the mecha from Full Metal Panic, if any of the readers have seen. (And Full Metal Panic is another that would be recommended)\nR2: (And if you don't like spoilers, stop reading now) Is the second series. This follows Zero as he is hated by everyone, save for a select few... It isn't until halfway to two-thirds of the way the world fully places Zero as an enemy, but his life gets harder and harder, and we see the hurt from Lelouche's life as he has to get more and more detached from reality, at least publicly. This series really culminates around tragedy, and loss. I cant say much more without giving away much more to the story. But I thoroughly recommend watching this second series.\nThis Jack Rabbit gives Code Geass an easy 5 out of 5. If I may add personal notes here, I am not found of the actual art style, but that's an issue of preference. But the show was so good, that in the end, the art style did not matter at all. I loved it, and would recommend it to anyone.\nCode Geass is an anime produced by Sunrise in Japan, and licensed in the States by Bandai. Sunrise is a subsidiary of Namco Bandai Holdings. I'm just a viewer. ^_^ \n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=6, ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I might sound lame, but I just watched Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion last October 2011. Most of my fellow animé enthusiast friends tell me this same line in a surprised tone: \"What? You're just watching it now?\" Personally, I don't get why they're so surprised that I was just about to watch Code Geass. I just started in the whole animé thing at that time, after all.\nThen I watched Code Geass. Then I figured out why they were so surprised at me. Code Geass doesn't just pass as some standard animé title; Code Geass is a story of epic proportions, with a lead\n          \n        character who you'd probably least expect to be one of your future favorite characters, nonetheless one of the most celebrated characters in animé history--or animation history, in general.\nCode Geass presents itself as a cut above the rest; after all, you don't get to watch shows about anti-hero leads frequently. You don't get to watch anti-hero leads with mechas frequently, either. Code Geass manages to mix two genres, already detail-heavy on their own, and still come out as a masterpiece definitely deserving of the numerous awards already awarded to it. Here's why.\nStory, for a short review, is simply amazing. Lelouch Lamperouge, our lead here, is as outstanding as he gets. Not only is he the perfect anti-hero, he's also the vice-president of his school student council. Code Geass meshes the two facets of his life--as a student and as a rebellious individual--and turns it into an orchestrated story which blurs the line between the two distinctly different faces of his daily life. Bring that with an initial premise as revolutionary as it is amazing, and you get a story that spans ideals and beliefs. You never thought an animé would ever get this deep a story. At least I did.\nArt doesn't fall behind the story. CLAMP didn't fail in implementing their already unique style to the already unique story. This joint effort results in an animation truly a cut above the rest. Mecha designs rival those of the famous Gundam series. Code Geass seemingly overflows with creativity in both story and design. It's just like in a picture I saw on the net about Code Geass. Expectations: Cardcaptor Sakura + Japan; Reality: Death Note + Gundam. To whoever made this, well played.\nThe melodies present in this series truly augments to the high tensions and the mellow moments present in the story. I don't usually download animé soundtracks, but Code Geass is the first exception. I've downloaded a few others after it, but Code Geass will always be the first. Opening and ending themes are also excellent. FLOW's \"COLORS\" and Ali Project's \"Yuukyou Seishunka\" make for great first opening and ending themes, respectively. I'll leave it to you guys to find out the other opening and ending theme.\nAnd here comes Code Geass' strongest aspect: character. You can easily rename this series as \"Lelouch Lamperouge\" and everyone probably wouldn't mind (though as a side note, its subtitle is \"Lelouch of the Rebellion\"). The story circles around Lelouch's development as an anti-hero and how he manages to blend it in with his everyday life. The story also shows how his family and friends slowly adapt to his peculiar tendencies in everyday life, and how his fellow revolutionaries slowly learn how he acts as a leader. Code Geass, above anything else, is about human emotional growth. That's my opinion, because I believe that each character's development is responsible for the great story this animé possesses.\nI rarely give perfect 10s for any animé I rate. Yet somehow, I find myself in awe of what this show delivers to me. It goes beyond simple viewing and watching--it's a experience. Code Geass takes you to stories where you find yourself sympathizing with the characters, especially Lelouch. It's even more astounding to think that this show has a sequel.\n        "},

In the beginning he meets an immortal woman named C.C, who grants him the Geass, a power that gives Lelouch the ability to make anyone do anything he says without question. He soon uses this power to bring Britianina to its knees. \nOverall, this is a pretty cool anime to watch, the major theme of the anime (including\n          \n        the 2nd season) is that, for some people, power is like a drug: The more they get, the more they want, and they'll do anything to maintain their position.

Well Its good not bad it has good taste in food, the sound track is so far I really like in any anime of 2007.

But I don't like killing your brothers and sisters for revenge, especially if they have no idea how did it. then playing a joke to kill people is not funny especially if you have the power to mind control that you cant control. And the only way to stop that person is to kill them and the worst part there is that person is your own sister that's just great. I just don't like the idea of killing people in cold blood especially if they are your relatives that love you and didn't know that your still alive.

Code Geass doesn't keep dragging on and on and there is a total of 50 episodes in which things keep happening continuously.

While they both are psychological in nature and have equally devious leads, that doesnt mean that they are alike, so what im saying is that those of you who came here expecting a death note clone should look elsewhere.\nWARNING-MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS\nStory: The story follows a young britanian lelouch as he tries to bring down the britanian empire(im sure\n          \n        we all know this part by now) by killing off the important leaders, who just happen to be his family. He takes on a false identity and takes control of a band of terrorists and fights highly strategic battles against the empire, his family, and his best friend.\nArt: the artwork was friggin fantasic especially in the fight scenes but aside from that theres not alot i can say.\nCharacter: The characters range from bubbly or sullen all the way to cruel and sadistic. I like the stark contrasts in the ideas of justice put forth by lelouch and suzaku as they fight for opposing sides. The characters have deep backstories and you get to know them, which is a luxury that we dont get with very many shows. \nEnjoyment: I started watching this one day and before I knew it, I had seen the whole show, and had no idea where all the time had went. The one problem I had is that in the last few episodes I was sitting there wondering \"what the hell just hapenned?\" and thats how the show ended. This woudve pissed me off beyond belief if it werent for the second season of the show where all of the questions are answered.\nIn Closing: This show comes together magnificantly and is easy to follow, you will be drawn in and hooked.

			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=6, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    VERY GODLY ANIME\nStory 10:The series takes place in an alternate universe where Japan has been conquered by the “Holy Britannian Empire”, the world’s only superpower. Under Britannian rule, the native Japanese have been subjected to a cruel and oppressive foreign rule. At the heart of the conflict is the protagonist, Lelouch, who is a Britannian prince who hates the Empire. The story begins when he receives a special power from a mysterious girl. \nWhat I appreciated most about the story was the moral complexity and ambiguity. Nothing is clear cut and everyone (who survives) undergoes a significant character change. It’s one of those morally grey\n          \n        narratives where it’s hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys. Britannia is an evil empire, yes. I mean they ruthlessly execute Japanese civilians and their soldiers follow orders like Nazis, yet many of the series’ most likeable characters are Britannian students/citizens. The Japanese resistance on the other hand may stand for a noble, underdog cause, but they conduct terroristic bombings and execute Britannian hostages too. Ok, so who’s the “good guy”? If that’s an answer you need to have then this is not the anime for you.\nThe story is exciting and engaging and it definitely does a good job combining action with strategy and intrigue. \nCharacters 8: It’s rare and great when you have an anime that has exciting and well-developed characters along with a very cool plot. Often you have to choose between one or the other…or neither. Code Geass has both. The characters are complicated and don’t follow typical anime clichés.\nOne of the predominant themes that keeps surfacing is the challenge of fighting evil without becoming evil. \nI’m reminded of a famous quote from Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s Gulag Archipelago (which I was coincidentally reading at the time I watched this anime): \n“If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?”\nThe protagonist, Lelouch, embodies this good/evil dichotomy. He is intelligent, self-righteous, ambitious, vicious and powerful. The viewer can’t help but respect him and his obsessive, driven personality. However, this admiration becomes progressively more uncomfortable for the viewer as Lelouch’s hands become bloodier and bloodier in his quest to eradicate the evil empire of Britannia. Can one fight evil without becoming corrupted? Is it wrong to kill in the name of a righteous cause? Are people guilty by association? What are the dangers of seeing the world in black and white? These are some of the questions that are explored in Lelouch’s journey and (in my humble opinion) allow the anime to transcend just being a cool story and, instead, give it some philosophical depth. \nWhile Lelouch is the centerpiece, he is surrounded by very interesting characters too. And while these co-mains and supporting characters serve to give Lelouch more complexity, they are also very interesting and unique in their own right.\nFor example, when CC is rude or unreasonable it’s not part of some cutesy tsundere flirtation scheme…no, no, sometimes she can just be a major bitch…which is delightful to watch. Then there’s Suzaku, who I disliked at first for being a one of those over-powered, one-dimensional, annoying, simple-minded, pure-hearted idealists that pop up in anime so frequently, but even he turned out to be more complicated and flawed than I gave him credit for. And of course there’s Shirley, Episode 1: just the cheerful, preppy bimbo; Episode ???— Think again, she’s complicated too. Haha, I guess a good way to sum it up is that everyone in this anime has issues, which makes them interesting. And it’s through these unique characters that we get to see the different facets of Lelouch.\nArt 8: the art is beautiful, from the action sequences to the futuristic/Victorian scenery to the characters themselves. The animation takes a very strange approach to depicting the human body. I noticed that most of the characters have very androgynous body frames and are usually tall and oddly slender. In faraway shots people look almost like well-drawn scarecrows. This isn’t good or bad but it’s unique. What’s not unique though is the absolutely shameless product placement. In an alternate universe where Britain rules the world, battles are fought using mechs and where magical powers shape the course of global events, only one thing remains constant…Pizza Hut. That’s right, kids eat Pizza Hut. CC eats it in 90% of the scenes she in and still manages to maintain that slender figure I was talking about earlier. And despite Pizza not even being Japanese or British, Pizza Hut still shows up on buildings, in parties, on desks and even as a password during a crucial moment. I was seriously waiting for the Mechs to start entering battles with NASCAR-style Pizza Hut logos slapped on their guns. \nSound 8: Catchy intro but not my favorite. None of the other music stood out in a big way for me.\nCritiques: \nAt some point, every 17+ anime has to answer the simple question of how wrong is it to kill someone. Compare Elfen Lied and Psycho-Pass. Both are dark shows but Elfen Lied put very little moral weight on the masses of people Lucy slaughtered, and even portrayed her as a misunderstood and sympathetic character. Whereas, in Psycho-Pass, despite a great deal of violence and moral ambiguity, the death of a single anonymous person is still treated as something horrific, evil and thought-provoking. Code Geass is inconsistent and they kind of swing back and forth. Sometimes they’ll explore the psychological effects of a single death on different characters, but other times these same characters kill without so much as an afterthought and go on with their merry lives. I would have preferred more moral consistency. \nSatisfaction/Overall 9: I was very satisfied with the first season. \n        "},
			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=6, ["text"]="                          \n    My first try and I would rather cal it a \"rageview\" than a review. \nAlthough I scored Code Geass with a generous 8, I'll write more about the flaws of this series. I really can't deny that I enjoyed CG, yes even the redunant filler episodes were somehow entertaining but it's not as good as most of the viewers think. A masterpiece? Don't make me laugh, it's faraway from being one. Some of my friends recommended to watch CG and because of the great score and the so-called similarities with Death Note were a reason to watch it. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed\n          \n        this series but simultaneously I kinda hated it because I had high expectations and so the hype annoyed me markedly. There a lot of plotholes, well maybe there were times I didn't followed everything attentively but I'm sure that it also had many scenes which weren't explained, like how the hell xy survived the attack of the Gurren, or just laughable, Spinzaku with the power of avoiding gunshots.  The most ridiculous thing is the comparison with Death Note. Death Note had an intelligent plot and Light Yagami had a weapon which was explained to the smallest details but Lelouch's Geass respectively all the Geass weren't. The only thing we know about it, is that you need eyecontact with the victim and it can be only used once on a person (or in Mao's case a space of maximal 500 meters) but that's it. At the beginning Lelouch tried to get knowledge about it's function, for example testing how long it does work on people (not sure if they said how long it works). If you compare this to the Death Note with it many rules and limitations, it is just weak. Maybe the two protagonist have some things in common otherwise I can't see much of similarities between these two anime. Someone may perhaps found out that I also scored Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann with a 8 although it makes lesser sense than Code Geass but, folks, the big difference is that Code Geass WANTS to be a serious anime, TTGL however not. Just watch the first episode, it's clear as glass Gurren Lagann is nothing which cares about logic unlike CG which has superpowers and Mechas but for the rest it acts in a \"normal\" world and then I don't want to see soldiers who avoid gunshots like nothing. Well, yes it sounds very negative but like I said this series was entertaining, very entertaining I have to admit, I couldn't find a single episode which bored me and the story had also some nice moments and twists. It may just sound bad, but only because I was disappointed especially because it wasn't near of what Death Note is.\nThe art, mhh, my first contact with the \"noodle-character\"-artstyle from Clamp and I. don't. like. it. Definitely not my taste but well the art doesn't mind me too much. Apart from this the drawings and the animation were good I guess, no sightings of \"QUALITY\" or something like that. Even the use of CGI was fine, nothing what would outstand in a negative way from the drawings unlike Iron, pardon, CGI Man. \nCG's OST is really something great. Whether the great orchestrated tracks of the Black Knights or the \"Theme\" of Britannia, it fits and creates a good atmosphere. However the openings and endings aren't my type, typically the \"just-one-time-after-I'll-skip-it\"-Ops/Eds except for the first Op and Ed, yes, the all hated first Ending. Somehow I managed to like it and it fits with the scenes of the ending in my opinion. \nThe character-cast includes a huge amount of chara-types. Partly of this, many of them are shallow, not a big surprise or a grave flaw though. Well most of the cast was okay, Lelouch is no Light but I kinda enjoyed him and his campaign against Britannia. \nOverall I had a lot of fun watching this. Better than the mediocre moe-anime for sure but never the masterpiece many people think of it.  There are positive aspects but many ignore the flaws, flaws which a \"masterpiece\" shouldn't have. Entertaining sure but the hype and wrong comparisons with Death Note diminish my impression of Code Geass a little bit.\nSorry for my horrible english. \n        "},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=6, ["text"]="\n                          \n    This is my first review, but I was really compelled to write a review for Code Geass because it is the first anime to grab me in quite a while. Although I wasn't very interested to watch it because I heard CLAMP did the character designs, I was drawn in from the first episode by the (I mean this in the best way possible) exaggerated animation; close ups, angles, movements and facial expressions from the characters. Seeing the driving forces behind the main characters and the royal family members gives them a human side the watcher can somewhat identify with, making you unable to completely\n          \n        hate them. Like Cornelia is a battle hardened merciless commander, but has a soft spot for her sister and her other siblings. The storyline continued to surprise me, not pulling any punches and had great development for its genre, giving plot twists that knocked me off my feet. The only downside I saw lies with Lelouch. I can say his character is really great and fits the leading role of his other identity Zero well. But there were times I was hoping he would show a little more remorse or regret for his actions. However it's that same trait that makes him a solid leader a good character. Awesome show I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.\n        "},

			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=6, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    After roaring onto the anime scene at the helm of Infinite Ryvius, director Goro Taniguchi has had something of a checkered history. His series are visually inventive and unfailingly entertaining, but beyond that, quite variable. It's his habit to follow each of his respectable projects (Ryvius and the more modest but equally brilliant Planetes) with something, to put it kindly, with a lot more trash in it—a la the intense but insanely stupid s-CRY-ed. By that logic Code Geass, coming on the heels of the spectacularly uneven Gun x Sword, should be a beautifully-constructed masterpiece. Well, patterns, like rules, are made to be broken.\nFrom the\n          \n        first episode, when Taniguchi takes his tale of political strife and drives it straight into the kind of hammy, blood-soaked territory that would have been handled by Vincent Price were it a micro-budgeted live-action film from the seventies, it's obvious that a masterpiece is out of the question. Lelouch is a bastard, full of hubris. Superior characterization is supplanted by a slew of characters as thin as their whipcord designs (by CLAMP). Tense mecha battles alternate with stretches of goony humor that blend into the series' tales of terrorism and compromised morality like hippies at a skinhead convention. And occasionally the series wanders off onto single-episode tangents that might as well have “character-building” signs stapled to their foreheads. Hardly the stuff of masterpieces.\nBut no one ever said that a series had to be a masterpiece to be good. The sizable cast is also as colorful as their designs, Lelouch's hubris is tempered by his absolute devotion to his sister and friends (and it doesn't hurt that he regularly gets his comeuppance), and the plot—cobbled together from equal parts Death Note and Gundam Seed—is propelled at such a speed that neither its derivation nor its jarring shifts in tone have much time to rankle. The massacre that rages over the first two episodes sets the tone, never letting up or allowing the tension to flag, even as it prioritizes careful strategy over godlike piloting skills.\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=6, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    DISCLAIMER: This is my FIRST review, there will be as many spoilers as there will be hate: NONE. This review will also cover BOTH seasons of Code Geass, although it is posted on the first season, i'm not prepared to write separate reviews, if you have seen the first season but not the second, this review will not spoil anything, but might include minor references to the second season. That is all, enjoy.\nStory 10\nThe story line of Code Geass is one that cannot be \"compared\" or said to be \"similar to\" anything else, anything else I can think of anyway. The story follows a young\n          \n        genius student named Lelouch Lamperouge, who, when competing in a chess match against a Brittanian aristocrat, is caught up in a supposed \"terrorist\" attack, after a short series of events Lelouch finds himself at gunpoint by Brittanian soldiers, he is to be killed, but a girl named C.C, the item stolen by the terrorists, grants him the power of the king; Geass, the absolute power to bend anyone to your will. After acquiring this unique power, Lelouch realizes what potential it holds, and begins to change the world, one step at a time. He is taken on an amazing journey, meeting many new characters who all play a significant role throughout the 2 seasons. He uncovers the truth about others, and hides his at the same time. The story line of Code Geass is magnificent, dark, humorous and unique, definitely a recipe for success.\nArt 8\nThe Art style of Code Geass is questionable, while it does not affect the flow of the story, nor is it badly done, but some may find it odd, I personally have never seen an anime with characters quite this thin, in fact I have a friend who likes to mock the art style, nevertheless, whilst the art is, as aforementioned, questionable, it really didn't have an impact on my enjoyment, nor should it on yours.\nSound 9\nThe voicing of Code Geass was brilliant, People like Lloyd Asplund, the cynical manager of the Lancelot Knightmare Frame, have a very suiting voice to fit his attitude and personality, while he doesn't play a main role, I always enjoyed his dialogue. The rest of the voices are generally great, with a few miscellaneous characters with minor dialogue being meh, ok. The Openings of Code Geass were always something I looked forward to hearing, especially COLOURS (1st OP). The ending credits songs were so-so, but were never bad, and I never skipped them. The music played throughout the episodes also give the ambient atmosphere that suits the anime. A fantastic score of musical talent expressed in Geass.\nCharacters 10\nThe characters of Code Geass have made me change the way I act in my life, especially Lelouch, his melodramatic and sometimes sarcastic tone when he knows he has won is just so good, his evil laugh *cough cough Light Yagami cough cough* is fairly sincere as he slowly goes mad with his power. C.C was the other character who I felt, despite being a main character, didn't make as big of an impact in some parts of the show as I had hoped. Battle scenes where Kallen and Suzaku are fighting, things are blowing up, etc. etc. Lelouch and C.C are there in the Gawain, Lelouch might be laughing or stressing, but C.C is just there piloting, asking for commands and giving information. Plus i'm pretty sure a romantic (using that term lightly) story was brewing between Lelouch and C.C, and while this is certainly true when you google \"Lelouch and C.C\", I had high hopes for a more intricate look at this, but to no avail. All other characters were portrayed very nicely, with the same exceptions as the sound section. A few unnecessary characters with insignificant roles, but despite that, C.C and Lelouch brought it home for me.\nEnjoyment 10\nDoes anything need to be said here? 10/10 enjoyment, loved every aspect of this anime, I watched this after finishing Death Note, and after loving the likes of Light Yagami's intelligence and various schemes, I was pleasantly surprised to find 50 episodes of action with a main character more cunning and courageous than Light ever was.\nOverall 10\nThis anime will forever hold a place in my heart, and while dreaming that I could have the power of Geass embedded in my left eye, I don't see that happening anytime soon... This is one of those anime that no matter what kind of person you are, no matter what kinds of anime you like to watch, you can't go wrong here, if you are influenced by reviews and ratings, there is no excuse for you not to watch this, influenced by your friends or people around you? Same applies, even if you don't like supernatural occurrences or massive mechs in your anime, you will enjoy Code Geass to some extent, while others (including myself) loved it to the point where you rate almost every aspect a 10/10. \n~Xeno156  \n        "},

T^T\nAfter watching it , I could not watch anything similar for a while! At first,  I thought, \"Eww, mechas?!? Like Gundam?\" but after bearing myself deeper, I slapped myself for doubting.\nCode Geass actually makes you care for the characters. The protagonist was executed well; whenever Lelouch came across a dilemma or faced a certain hardship, you really felt his pain and you deeply sympathized with him.\nEach and every character is unique and many of the most memorable characters have their dark side and flaws to them. There is no definite good or evil, right\n          \n        or wrong.\nThis emotional evoktion had me cheering for him in the end!

Tehee, this series was like \"Who has the more and stronger mecha wins.\" The plot was delicately twisted with the characters.\n R2 was not another unnecessary extended sequel. \n        "},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=6, ["text"]="\n                          \n    What is there to say about Code Geass? Well, first of all, I want to say that this is easily one of my favorite shows of all time (animated or otherwise). Before going too far, this will be a review for the English dub of Part I.\nOn a technical level, this series is absolutely flawless (which also applies to Code Geass R2, which is done by the same company). Code Geass has by far some of the best artwork I've ever seen in any series (but what do you expect when Clamp is doing the designs?) There is not a single poorly designed character, mecha,\n          \n        or background set to be found, nor is there any sign of short-cuts in the animation, it's absolutely beautiful to watch. The same is true of the music, it fits perfectly well with every setting and adds extra emotion to every scene (of those songs, my favorites are probably the insert songs \"Innocent Days\" and \"Stories\", as well as the first opening \"Colors\").\nCharacter wise, it's a very strong and colorful cast, the main character Lelouch is one of the most complex characters you'll ever get (and maybe it's just me, but having Vash the Stampede's voice actor laugh manically is always worth a few extra points in a review to me!) The entire English cast performs brilliantly as well (with powerhouses such as Johnny Yong Bosch, Yuri Lowenthal, Kate Higgens, Steven Blum, and Kirk Thorton, that's probably not a surprise). Although I love all the characters, I do have one minor quibble; a lot of the characters that are introduced aren't really fleshed out, even though they're given a lot of in-story importance (Kaguya being the biggest offender, even in R2). Again, this is really a minor quibble, as even those unnecessary characters are a lot of fun (this isn't usually true for me in a series, but there isn't a single character that I dislike from Code Geass, even when they aren't totally useful).\nTo my mind, the weakest element of Code Geass (both parts) was always the story. This isn't to say that the story is bad, and in fact given how insanely good the rest of the elements are, a weakness for this series is still quite good for most series (though again, not spectacular). Without spoiling any scenes, my biggest problem is that a lot of background information is taken for granted by the main series. Without spoiling too much, the series tells us that Lelouch and the secondary main character Suzaku Kurarugi are best friends from childhood but doesn't really give us any real background about the nature of the relationship from back then (though the series does rectify it through the use of short sound and picture dramas, if you haven't heard them, many scenes don't really have the same force that they should have because of it). Again, the story isn't horrible, and even without the supplemental material it is pretty easy to understand, but I do wish they would have tried to insert them better into the series. Still, the story is probably stronger than most other shows I've seen so I can't be too harsh about what is ultimately a minor flaw.\nAll in all, I highly recommend Code Geass for all anime fans, and for some who aren't necessarily anime fans.\n        "},

He wants to seek revenge on his father for killing his mother. One day he meets a girl name C.C who gives him the power of Geass. Geass allows him to control the minds of people.

			{["score"]=7, ["helpful"]=2, ["text"]="                          \n    This will be a review of both R1 and R2.\nCode Geass is an anime that is often deemed a masterpiece, but in my opinion, it is far from it. There are unfortunately a lot of plot-holes, lots of contrivances and plot conveniences, and things that are just silly. But other than that, the anime is still good. I give it a 7/10 overall. Here is why.\nStory: 5\nThe story is the biggest problem I had with the show, but it was still okay. Instead of focusing on Lelouch's internal struggles for power and trying to find his place in the world, it seems like the story\n          \n        was too focused on the mech-battles. They are cool, sure, but it doesn't really leave any room for emotion. In addition, the story moves too fast for its own good. Instead of focusing on backstories and character development, characters would die and leave me thinking \"Oh, that's sad I guess,\" instead of me being deeply moved. Here's an example. A villain is introduced at the end of an episode at the very beginning of the show, but is killed off at the beginning of the next episode for what seems to be no reason. They didn't give any character development or any time for the audience to process anything. The pacing is just too quick. Unfortunately, that's kind of what Code Geass does. There are also a lot of moments that leave you thinking \"What?\" but you just kind of have to roll with it. This is my main criticism of Code Geass. Also, expect to see a lot of the Pizza Hut logo and fan service).\nTL;DR: They over-complicated such a simple and unique plot.\nArt: 8\nI don't have any complaints, really. The art style fits Lelouch quite nicely, and when Lelouch would activate his Geass it looked quite pretty.\nSound: 9\nThe first intro theme is one of my favorite openings in anime. The other openings weren't really good, though, unfortunately. The outros were quite nice, too. The OST itself was great. Some awesome trumpet flairs that fit Lelouch quite nicely, and some beautiful melodies. They did a great job with the soundtrack. Probably my favorite thing that I liked about the anime, especially since it fit Lelouch quite nicely.\nCharacter: 8\nLelouch Vi Britannia is the only character that I REALLY liked. There were some other awesome characters, like Mao, C.C., Suzaku, Kallen, Jeremiah, etc., but they were all kind of overwhelmingly overshadowed by Lelouch. His disguise, Zero, was also quite the awesome addition to Lelouch. There were also some bad characters. Like Nina and Nunally. Nunally didn't really annoy me, but she wasn't really good until last arc of R2. Also, a lot of people don't like Suzaku, for some pretty good reasons. So, good characters, but there were a lot that I really didn't care about to be honest. The villains were a bit disappointing, too, and I think that Mao was really the only good one. His arc should have been longer. Had an awesome backstory, an awesome power, and gave Lelouch quite the struggle.\nEnjoyment: 8\nI enjoyed it quite a bit, but am disappointed that it wasn't a 10/10. I feel like the problems that I have with the show hindered my enjoyment quite a bit. I wanted to see some real psychological battles, and not just mech-battles. If they cut the futurism back a bit and made the atmosphere more melancholy with higher steaks, that would have been better. There should have been more bloodshed, and I'm talking man to man combat, and maybe some plasma guns instead of just people in powerful suits.\nOverall: 7\nWould I recommend Code Geass? Absolutely. Just be aware that there is quite a lot that gets left unexplained, which does hinder enjoyment quite a lot. Also if you're expecting a lot of psychological elements, then realize this probably isn't the anime you're looking for. But if you desire some cool plot twists, an AWESOME supernatural element, an AWESOME main character, with some cool fights, then this is for you. I honestly understand why this is some people's favorite anime, and why others hate it. I love it, but it could have been a LOT better. Nevertheless, I'm excited to see R3 and I hope that it's good! This is a really fun anime, but it isn't all that deep, which is something that one would expect it to be."},

An unparalleled masterpiece would be justifiable epithet for this anime. It is much smarter and deeper behind it's facade than many people tend to notice.\nIt has a story with both global conflict and a personal one. Japanese fight for independence is easy to understand so I would not go into details. But for example Lelouch's motivation for being Zero and starting a rebellion is very solid and well thought one. That is very different from\n          \n        for example Light's whimsical attempt to make world a better place in Death Note. Because, if you think of it, killing already incarcerated criminals who no longer can kill or hurt anyone since they are in jail would not change much.\nI will cover a single event of the plot in detail to highlight the level of depth in the story and its characters:\nWhile that wasn't spelled out very clearly: Lelouch was pretty much betrayed by Charles and send to a certain death in Japan before Britannia even invaded it. Britannians assumed that Japanese will kill Lelouch and Nana, who were staying with Japanese prime minister's family, in retaliation for the invasion. That is why for example Clovis was so surprised to see Lelouch alive.\nLelouch clearly understood what Charles have done, and that he might do it again and send two of then to another country shortly before the invasion, and that other country might actually decide to kill two of them in retaliation for the invasion. That is why he did not returned to the royal family but instead lived disguised as commoner. Such a tragic backstabbing from his family definitely influenced his personality and convinced him to destroy Britannia.\nAnd as story progresses and he keeps going on with his war against Britannia he faces realities of his choice and its consequences. The outcomes of his actions are often realistic and logical which makes story believable and real. Several times he has to choose between his quest and something else, like his friends or former love interest, and even make sacrifices to keep going towards his goal. Lelouch's learns from the events around him and his occasional mistakes and becomes wiser, more cunning and pragmatic. His personality develops as story progresses.\nOther characters, not only major ones like CC, Suzaku but also more minor ones like Shirley, Mao, Jeremiah and even Nina also have well thought personalities and as story progresses they develop further and meaningfully change, influenced by the events of the plot. They are much more realistic and believable then many more stereotyped single trait characters in many other shows.\nAlso Code Geass has well though battles where tactics and strategy and not overpowered abilities or emotions determine who wins. And there are also deep philosophical statements and life observations.\nAnd while being so deep Code Geass still manages to stay entertaining and fun to watch. So surely it deserves to be called masterpiece.\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    \"What is this fuckery with my emotions?\" This is the question I keep asking myself as I watched this anime.\nCode Geass surprised me in many ways. I started watching it with an expectation that it be basically a mimic of Death Note, and while I admit that there are fundamental overlying tenets with Death Note, it is pleasantly much more different than I had imagined.\nLet's start with the good things about CG:\nThe characters. You hate them. You love them. You want to punch them in their faces. You want to hug them during times of tragedy. Ultimately, the characters presented in CG are come off\n          \n        as much more human and are more relatable than the characters in Death Note. Lelouch is a much more complicated. There are times during which his dark side shine, and you really believe he is a demon. However, throughout the season, he faces many more moral dilemmas than Light does. This is simply due to the fact that Lelouch has many more people he deeply cares about than Light does. His intentions are a messy mix of thirst for revenge, corruption by power, arrogance, guilt over hurting those close to him, and his love for his sister. Many of the supporting characters are equally complex, notably Suzaku. One of the most intense and interesting characteristics about this anime is the juxtaposition between Suzaku's and Lelouch's ideology and what Lelouch says, \"which one of us is the bigger hypocrite.\"\nEven if you don't end up liking Lelouch or Suzaku (the two central characters), the chances are that you'll find at least one other character you can empathize with or at the very least root for.\n\nI like the setting of the anime and the general framework of the plot. Let's be real. Just because there are megatrons and magical girls running around, this anime isn't completely out of this world. In a colonial society, the Japanese or Elevens have a choice: submit to the higher authority in a state of indefinite subjugation, or risk losing everything to fight for true freedom. Like any war or military conflict, lives will be lost. Morals will be questioned. People will be led down the path of darkness. Many things happen that you don't want to happen, but that's the bleak reality of what happens in a colonial struggle like this one. While this certainly isn't the only theme of CG, it does get you thinking about the world around you. Remove the fantasy and sci-fi elements from this, and you basically have an idea of the questions that arose in most of the countries that exist today as they revolted against their colonial oppressors. \nHowever, for me, the plot was driven mostly be the interactions between characters and their struggle to distinguish right from wrong. Layered atop a complex battle for independence is the emotional fuckery I was talking about. This anime tugged at my heartstrings a lot more than I expected because of the inherent human element to it.\nNow, my qualms:\nUltimately, my qualms are pretty minor. One of the things CG tries to do is cover as many anime genres as possible from mecha to slice of life. Tidbits of romance and fanservice are incorporated. While I thought it was done decently well, I can see why people would complain about CG trying to tackle too many things at once and spreading itself out thin.\nAnother qualm I have is with Kallen's character development. An episode was narrated by her, and although she is a main character (fights in all battles), I feel like there's some empty room for real character exploration that the show doesn't quite fulfill. Essentially, it's lost potential.\nLastly, I find Lelouch's ideology to be hard to follow. Light's was simple: create a world without villains/criminals with him as the arbiter of justice. WHile I like lelouch's complexity, I find his elaborate schemes to be a bit \"extra\" if his sole motivation is to protect his sister. However, some of these problems are resolved in s2,  when he finally gets a better idea of what it is he's truly fighting for. \nOverall, it's a must watch anime!\n        "},

I don't want to be bias but Code Geass is an excellent anime from the story to characters. The development of the story is really good where you're going to start having paranoid thoughts on what's going to happen in the next episode because of all the thriller and actions happening. \nFurthermore, the way they developed the protagonist's background is really amazing but it's more amazing how they developed all the antagonist background as well that made the viewers think\n          \n        who's on the right side of what they're doing. Also, talking about the action scenes, some viewers said that the mecha fights doesn't suit in the story but to me, it totally fits to everything what's happening. \nOn the other hand, some viewers said that the animation for this anime is a bit outdated for a 2006 anime but all I can say is that they managed to make a beautiful anime like this with beautiful fighting scenes and especially the thrilling story so for me and maybe for most of the people reading this right now. It's totally worth watching this anime for the PLOT ;)\nTo conclude everything, it's a must-watch anime for all of you out there and for the people who just wants to start a new hobby, then it's a really good anime to start your hobby. \n        "},

Aquí en donde las pequeñas cosas pueden hacer la diferencia. \nAlgo que me sorprendió y me gusto de Code Geass fue como pudo combinar tramas que ya se habían visto y las hizo funcionar; el uso de un poder que daba cierto control sobre los otros, y una lucha en mechas\n          \n        por la libertad de un país. Pero así como unas cosas le sirven otras no, además de lo mencionado anteriormente, el anime también tiene toques del típico anime ecchi/escolar/comedia que a mi parecer no encaja para nada y en cierto momento el anime se aleja de la historia principal para contarnos algo que si bien podría explicar algunas situaciones en el futuro, es innecesario y muy molesto.\nEl anime tiene una gran cantidad de personajes para solo ser de 25 capítulos. Pero, a excepción de uno que otro, no los siento molestos y aunque a veces sean aplastados por lo OP del protagonista, me parece que ayudan a desarrollar la historia.\nPara mi Code Geass es un anime entretenido y hasta ahí.

			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=2, ["text"]="                          \n    You ever see one of those places that makes fast food items but does them really fancy and gourmet? (Yes, this is an Anime review, just stick with me for a bit.) They make burgers and fries, but instead of using passable and cheap ingredients, they put time, effort, and resources into their product and make something that resembles what you see at a chain franchise, but after you've eaten it realize it's so much more than that. That is what Sunrise's \"Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion\" is. A great Anime disguised as a garden variety mech. \nAny great TV show, movie, etc. is\n          \n        gonna rely on a great story and great characters. This has both. In an alternate universe, in 2010, Japan gets conquered by the Holy Empire of Britannia. Re-named \"Area 11\" and is subjugated to a new, tyrannical rule by a bunch of fancy, pompous, bad guys with royal titles and really over the top outfits. These guys are easy to hate. Naturally, a rebellion starts up. Rag tag heroes we can easily get behind. Both sides use mechs (called Knightmare Frames) as primary weapons, but they are not the center of the story and the end all, be all of winning the battle like most other shows. The characters are the money. Lelouch, our titular character who is suddenly endowed with a magical power to will anyone to obey his commands, commands our attention as a master tactician even without his ability. Kururugi, torn between loyalties to country and those he is sworn to serve, easy to empathize with. Kallen, the endearing, bad ass resistance chick who also provides most of the fan service in the show, those are just 3 of what is a very rich cast with good depth of character to each of them. \nThe writing in this show utilizes this cast and provides some of the best story telling and plot twists I have seen this side of \"Death Note\" all while giving us great scenes of combat with giant robots for those who need a fix of that sweet, sweet, 'splosion porn. This is all beautifully done with some gorgeous art and character designs that are bright, vibrant, and colorful providing a good contrast to the nightmare of war that so often surrounds them. My only complaint being they are too long and lanky in some ways, can somebody get these guys a sandwich? I realize war doesn't add meat to bones, but not everyone in this show needs to look like a scarecrow. I digress. You put all of it together and you have a new standard for greatness for the mech genre. \nWhile I adore this series on the whole, some things did bother me, and one is too much time putzing around in (you guessed it) A *BLEEPING* HIGH SCHOOL!!! It's a prestigious academy, etc, where all these teenagers would naturally meet and interact, so it makes sense as a plot device, but we spend much too much time here doing event planning and Character X has a crush on Character Y. As good as the writing is, some of the subplots are too drawn out and the cat and mouse game of when will this character learn the truth about this other character, which they inevitably do, gets tiresome when you know it's going to happen at some point. Even with this however, the 24 episode season is immensely binge worthy and these speed bumps do little to harm the pace of plot. \nSub vs. Dub time. This was a tough one. I must admit. But, I really like the English dub better than the Japanese cast. Mainly because Johnny Yong Bosch gives the performance of his career as Lelouch. With this he has forever separated himself from the \"Power Rangers\" franchise and establishes himself as one of the premier voice actors in the English dub world. The rest of the cast is hit or miss at times, but he makes it all worth it. Top the rest of the ear driven experience off with great sound effects and a very good score in the show (I found the opening and closing credits music to be basic and skippable) and you have a complete experience for the senses.  \nMy personal journey into this show was like most others, word of mouth, \"This is great! You should watch it.\" I saw commercials with big robots blowing stuff up. Sounds good, looks good, okay- I tuned in one day and I saw our main character chasing a cat who had run off with his helmet. \"Okay, this is a waste of time...\" was my reaction and I moved on to other things. After giving the show a proper watch, I realized how wrong I was and how I had walked in at one of the silliest scenes possible. This show inspires interest and gets you emotionally invested all while being supremely entertaining. This is everything one could ask for in an Anime and more than you could ever expect from a show with giant robots. This show is fantastic. Not perfect, but damn close. 8/10. Check it out. Cheers!    \n        "},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=2, ["text"]="\n                          \n    Hi guys!\nThis is my first and SPOILER-FREE review on MAL. I would love for you to read it if you're looking to watch this anime as it will explain it a lot. Code Geass is one of the best animes I've ever seen that was cleverly and nicely thought-ought..This review will give a synopsis and explain the perks and bad things to the anime.\n--\n[This is a synopsis for if you don't fully understand MAL's synopsis, drop down a couple paragraphs to skip it.]\nThe Holy Britannian Empire is a very dystopian power-hungry dictatorship led by a leader who cares of destruction and the rule of his\n          \n        empire. This Empire has it's destructive grip around Japan, enslaving their people and objectifying them. Japan is considered \"Area 11\", and Japanese people are to be labeled as \"Elevens.\" They are looked at as dirt to the Brits. \nThis is where prince Lelouch Lamperouge of the Holy Britannian Empire, the main protagonist of Code Geass, comes in. As he is son of the dictator-heavy emperor Charles Lamperouge,  that means Lelouch is a prince of Britannia and a part of the royal family. Emperor Charles cares very much about his empire and therefore he neglects his family, which Lelouch hated. Charles couldn't care less about Lelouch's mother, Lelouch's handicapped sisterm Nunally, or Lelouch hisself. He even directly told the young Lelouch that he is only a pawn.\nLelouch hated this very much so. It enraged him that his father didn't care about his family. This drove Lelouch with a hate to his father and the Britannian Empire as a whole. He wanted a changed world, and so with this new-found hatred and fire in his soul he acted on this pipe dream of his. He wanted a better world of peace and equality for his family, the Japanese, and the Brits. With that he makes a deal with a girl to obtain the power called \"Geass\" and creates a rebellion of his own to become a powerful force against the Britannian Empire. The anime revolves around Lelouch's rebellion and Lelouch hisself.\n--\nThat being said, Lelouch brilliantly thought-out character. He bears great finesse, cleverness, intellect, drive, and charisma. Lelouch is one of the greatest protagonists I have seen in anime history.\nBut one of the best things about Lelouch is that he hisself can't really be categorized as good or evil. He possesses actions and traits to which are good, he possesses some that are evil, and some that are anti-hero. This heavily diversifies Lelouch and just makes him a beautiful character. This is something very unique and is not very common in anime..\nTo conceal his identity as he fights against his bretheren, he creates an alternate identity/second life, Zero. As Zero, he wears a a very evil-looking cowl/cape over a matching uniform. But more importantly Lelouch wears a high-tech helmet to conceal his face. There is a compartment that opens up a slit for his right eye so he can make eye-contact with his victims and use his Geass ability..\nThe power of Geass. Lelouch's best weapons are indeed his brains and finesse, but he also has an ability which heavily propels and supports his rebellion and the plot of the anime, which is his Geass power.\nGeass is given through a mutual contract or covenant. It doesn't have a set-in-stone ability; it resides in every user differently and is very diverse. Every user's eyes will turn red and have a bird symbol on their iris' when they trigger their ability..I will say the power of Geass will violently change the user's lives, whether it be good or evil.\nIn Lelouch's case, his Geass power is very potent and helpful for his aspirations. With one look into the person's eyes, Lelouch can order the victim to do anything he desires. His Geass power definetly has a great impact onto the plot and stirs many issues. \n(For those of you who think \"Why can't he just order everyone to submit to him?\" It's not that simple. There are many reasons to this which I will explain some below.)\n--\nA big point to add in are the mechas, or coined \"Knightmares\" in the anime. They are big, humanoid mechanized fighters-vehicles that are heavily used in the military of the Holy Britannian Empire. But more importantly there are Knightmares that have a heavy effect onto the plot.. There are monotone, standard-issue Knightmares piloted by regular soldiers that serve to fight and control, and then there are also a few very unique, powerful and colorful Knightmares piloted by important characters that have heavy impact onto the fights, skrimishes and friendships. These are the hearts of the combat in Code Geass.\nA great example to go in-depth on the \"important Knightmares\" fiasco would be to bring up one Knightmare dubbed \"Lancelot.\" A white and gold, sword-weilding Knightmare that is very highly acrobatic, fast, flexible, and skilled in combat. Lancelot is a trump card of the Britannian Empire and he is used skillfully by Britannian commanders to fight against the rebellion. \n(This is all I will go into detail about the important Knightmare pilots as I believe it is a badass and cool aspect of Code Geass and so I am gonna let you discover the rest.)\nThere is one very important detail to the pilot of Lancelot. The pilot is Suzaku Kururugi, a friend of Lelouch in school. This creates a lot of issues with Lelouch concealing hisself as the Rebellion leader and has to fight a friend. More issues come too that I am not going to spoil.\n--\nSuzaku isn't the only friend of Lelouch's that know eachother in school and in greek life but unknowingly are adversaries in war. There are a few more people that are like this to Lelouch. As I don't want to spoil, I will not go into it too deeply. All I will say is that it adds a whole new layer of issues and conflicts that will become big roadblocks to Lelouch's friendships and his rebellion.\nThis is a very big aspect to the whole plot and heavily drives it. It stems a lot more issues in general. I love it.\n--\nThere is a lot of good things to say about Code Geass which I have listed above. You should definetly watch it. But of course, all animes have it's flaws and Code Geass does too. These couple issues will probably bother you if you are very critique-heavy..otherwise they won't really have much of an issue to you.\nEssentially, there were a couple times the anime brought in a couple issues abruptly. If you watched the anime, you'd probably know. But since this is a spoiler-free review I am not going to talk about it.\nAnother thing I didn't like, is how much loopholes the Geass power has, mainly Lelouch's Geass power. (As you know, he can order anyone to do anything he desires and they oblige and fulfill his order to the utmost extent.) There are a lot of questions arise the more he uses it, like \"What would happen exactly if you obstruct the victim from doing his/her order?\" \"What can stop or cancel the order given by Lelouch?\" and such. There's more questions than answers..\nI will be honest I am not too sure on the above statement. I haven't seen Part 2 of Code Geass as of this writing and so I don't know if they explain these things or not later on..\n--\nThis is not only it to the story that is Code Geass (part 1)..People will die, things will happen, jaws will drop..It's just a beautiful anime and it's so high on the charts for a reason.\nThere's also things like romance between Lelouch and such, which I did not cover in my review but will also impact the plot.\nThanks for reading my first review and I hope you watch Code Geass now :]\n        "},

At first, some viewers may dislike his cocky, almost self-centered attitude, but Lelouch does a great job at presenting his story and showing us why he does a certain action.  I also found him very easy to sympathize with him and I could feel his struggles.\nWell done art: Being an anime watcher of 2013-2015 animes mainly, I did not expect such stellar art from Code Geass.  The colours are vivid and the lines are crisp.  Characters, mechas, and backgrounds look great.  My only slight problem is when the long character bodies become just a bit too exaggerated.  It kinda becomes comical.\nGripping story: The story is awesome.  It is full of plot twists.  Since Lelouch is an underdog and his group is facing off against an entire empire, the plot is very likable in my perspective.  I always find it enjoyable when the odds are stacked against our protagonist and he or she has to find an original and unique way to solve the conflict.  They also show certain themes like tyranny, collateral damage, and greed in a cohesive manner that can affect the reader.  The story of Britannia and its colonial empire reminds me of how Britain has affected our real world in its history.\nWell-written hated characters: Suzaku and Nina are good at making the viewers rage and want to kill them.  Their backstories provide enough insight and logic, so their actions have a smidgen of reasoning in them.\nGood mecha action: This is my second mecha anime (first one being Gurren Lagann) and the fights are fun to watch in Code Geass.\nCons:\n2nd OP: Just skip it.  Please.\nIs Lelouch's power broken? : Sometimes, I felt that the power to control someone's mind gave Lelouch too much breathing room for mistakes, as he could plan his strategies extremely far ahead with that huge advantage in mind.\nOverall: 9.6/10\nA masterpiece of an anime with an addicting story and a marvelous protagonist.  No real weakness in Code Geass as well.\n"},

It's really that addictive. \n  It doesn't matter what type of anime you're into, this one has bits of everything from school life\n          \n        to mechas, so it's appealing to almost all. The characters are unusually lovable, many extremely well thought out and unique in the way they act, and there's a very strong sense of morals and deep meanings to the story which might occasionally make you weep. X'D By the last episode you're so attatched to the characters, their morals and their way of life that you almost feel you're a part of the story yourself, experiancing what they experiance. Little reminder though: don't get Code Geass mixed up with reality, you might get arrested. \n  I'm not going to explain the story, because it's already in the description of the anime at the top ^ and I'd probably get too excited again and start blabbing out spoilers, but I'd highly reccomend this anime to everybody. It's a classic which should - and most probably will - be remembered for years. \n        "},

			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5, ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Code geass (both seasons) is my personal favourite anime. At this point in time I consider it the best I have seen.\nThere is so much about it that I like, It is intelligent, it has good fights, is has exellent pacing, interesting characters, is very unpredictable and has a supernatural element that fits with the rest in a good way without becoming stupid.\nIt depicts very acurately how a real war is waged, something you rarely see in media. \nYou make plans, the plan goes bad, you need to improvise or perish, your enemy makes new plans, if you don't counter them you are in trouble\n          \n        etc.\nIt also shows all aspects of a war, the strategic as well as the political. How support from the people is just as important as weapons to win a war.\nMost of all, nothing is ever certain. The plot twists are many, sharp and impossible to see coming, something that I really liked.\nFinally, this anime is intelligent, there are several big events that happen (I won't spoil anything here) that you need to stop and think about a little to realise just how clever they really are.\nIn conclusion, this anime is definitely worth checking out. If you don't like mechs, give it a shot anyway, you may be suprised.\n"},
			{["score"]=6, ["helpful"]=5, ["text"]="                          \n    This show, up until the final 3 episodes, was set to be a solid 8 or 9. You had solid mech combat, interesting politics, exciting action and a good bit of humour.\nThen it all goes a bit surreal.\nIn terms of plot, until the bizarre ending arc, you have a strong revenge story with a nice rebellion arc, about a prince trying to slaughter his way through his corrupt dynasty and avenge his mother.\nHe is able to do this thanks to mind control powers and fanatically loyal allies.\nAll well and good - there's a nice side-plot with a telepathic kidnapper, and an enemy ace pilot trying\n          \n        to stop the hero.\nHowever, the final arc is written to lead into a sequel that wasn't really needed, and goes totally pear-shaped. A minor villain is brought back as the final enemy. The technology accelerates past what you're used to. A ridiculous stand off occurs.\nIn short, it's a very weak ending.\nThe art is very much an acquired taste - the characters are very elongated and that may not appeal. The scenery is simple but adequate, and the mech designs are solid throughout. Music and sound are also good for the most part - the OP from FLOW (also known for the first opening of Eureka 7) is a really good choice.\nOverall, though, this show is ruined by a completely stupid and rushed ending to hook into a sequel. It could have been ended nicely after 25 episodes (although the last couple would have needed reworking) but instead plummets downhill. I was sitting slack-jawed in confusion as all manner of bizarre developments occurred, and there was very little resolution of what was going on. Much like Gravion, this is a show designed around its second season - unlike Gravion, this decision is badly implemented.\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5, ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Code Geass is truely a one of kind masterpiece. With it's dramatic plot and amazing visuals, I fell in love with the story and the characters at the first episode. \nLelouch has to be one of the most unique main characters I have met in my career of watching anime. Many people say that he resembles Light Yagami from Death Note, and I have to agree in a sense. They are both very charismatic and intelligent. Also, I find that they both have very dark characteristics that aren't associated with your everyday hero. Lelouch has become one of my favourite and most respected fictional characters.\n          \n\nThe art in Code Geass is astounding. CLAMP is a wonderful mangaka group and did a great job with the character designing. The concept of the Knightmare Frames were similar to Gundams, yet had some noticeably different aspects. \nMusic is a very important part of an anime that can make or break it in an instant. After listening to the original soundtrack of the show, I was shocked. I hadn't really noticed how the background music played in so perfectly with the many different scenes and lines of dialogue. \nThat brings me to my next point. With all it's dramatic twists and turns, I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole series. The story plot surrounding Lelouch and his revenge held both action and tragedy packed acts. At most points in the story, I could really feel the emotion that the characters were experiencing. During those heart wrenching times, I had to try to stop myself from slamming my hands to the desk or bawling my eyes out. \nMy rating of this anime may be a little over the top, as well as my review, but I can't help myself. I enjoyed myself immensely while watching this show and I probably will continue to rewatch this for a very long time. \n--Rennemeow :)\n        "},

They are the same show after all, and must be viewed in the context of each other.\nLet's get one thing out of the way:  some of you, like me, may have seen random stills from Code Geass and thought it was a shoujo.  It is not a shoujo, just a CLAMP anime.  There are subtle differences between the two.\nNow, to the show itself.  It is a gripping and compelling drama that can really tug on your heartstrings.  I teared up on multiple occasions and the ending was exceptionally well done,\n          \n        a feat that many otherwise good shows seem to struggle with.\nThe art is gorgeous, thought not everyone is into CLAMP's EVERYONE MUST BE PRETTY style, I think it works for the show.  The whole neo-Victorian aesthetic that many scenes seem to strive for  just works better with pretty people.\nIt's been a while since I watched it, so I don't remember much about the soundtrack, sadly, but the voice acting was all spot-on.\nOverall, I had a really fun time with this show, and will recommend it to anyone who likes things that are good and isn't worried about watching something his friends might initially mistake for a shoujo :P\n        "},

This is the anime that got me hooked on to watching anime in the beginning. Aside from Kallen looking like Aki in YGO5D's, which I found hilarious, the fact that Lelouch was both a Good guy and the Bad guy, he puts all the blame on himself, consciously and unconsciously, he is a master level tactician, and has a power that can make someone do ANYTHING for him.

			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5, ["text"]="\n                          \n    Without knowing anything about Code Geass before watching, I did not know what I had gotten myself into. Right from the start it grabbed my attention, evoking questions in a compelling way. I will not outline the plot as I believe other reviews do a very good job of that, but I will describe personal thoughts for someone who wants to know what they are in for if they decide to watch. The series has a way on ending each episode on a \"what's going to happen next?\" way but making you watch episode after episode, back to back. I have watched the two seasons\n          \n        both twich.(i just said two,both and twich 2 times in a row) yeah think about what i did just now!\nIt most certainly earns it's place with the \"must see\" list. The plot development is excellent, carrying forward characters who represent certain ideals within the well thought out story. It is one of the few animes I have seen which really does have you guessing left and right, but more often or not, you turn out to be wrong. With an inclusion of a vast array of characters, it contributes to what seems to be an ever growing story. Even though I have watched it twice, I still have the ability to just sit and watch with full enjoyment. To say that Code Geass has a re-watchable factor is an understatement, but what seems to add to that is the time scale at which it all takes place,it feels like a quite long and progressive trip, making you feel as if you have just been on an epic journey with the protagonist. From start to finish it had my full attention. I really do not have any complaints about this show.\nOn a final note, everyone that I know that has seen this anime, being an avid watcher or not, has been converted by the likable plot and character development right from the get go, which might mean something to you if you are reading this and you have not seen it yet. My enjoyment of this show tells me its 10! but thats just me. \n        "},
			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=5, ["text"]="                          \n    STORY\nGenerally, I rate the story on how much it interested me, rather than how plausible or unique it is. I also add points for comedy if it's well done, and subtract from my final score if there are glaring faults.\nHaving said that, I found Code Geass to be immensely enthralling, even when I've already seen it once before (read: two and a half years ago). The tension kept me on the edge of my seat, and the twists still genuinely surprised me. i even became more emotionally invested towards the end.\nHowever, it's also towards the end that I had some problems with; not just in\n          \n        how the story made one of the more shocking twists of the show (no matter how much it was foreshadowed), but also the ending. It actually ends on a huge cliffhanger, basically ordering you (no pun intended) to go watch season two, and I do so hate it when that happens.\nANIMATION\nI never do have much to say about the animation. Despite re-watching Code Geass for reviewing purposes, i eventually found myself overlooking the art/animation in favour of the story, which I really shouldn't be doing. Overall, the art was good, bright and colourful, and particularly detailed when the scene was set in one of the \"ghettos\", and the animation was mostly well done.\nSOUND\nThe BGM was largely forgettable for me, bar one or two tracks. It mostly fit well with the current situation, but more often than not, I wouldn't really notice it, particularly the Ashford Academy scenes.\nCode Geass sports two main opening themes that split the majority of the show between them, the second one being the worse one, IMO. On the other hand, I often found myself singing along to the first OP - Colors by Flow - as well as humming the first ED - Yuukyou Seishunka by Ali Project. This ending just seemed to fit CG more than the second one did, thought that's probably just personal preference butting in again.\nThere is, however, a third opening - Hitomi no Tsubasa by access - that took up the slot for the finale. This opening left a long-lasting impression on me, and personally edges ahead of Colors as favourite CG opening.\nThe voice actors largely do their jobs very well, with Jun Fukuyama doing a very good job as Lelouch. Thinking back, there was not a single voice that didn't really suit their characters, though that's probably because this WAS my second time watching CG, regardless of how long ago I first watched it.\nCHARACTERS\nThe characters, for me, were rather hit-or-miss. On the one hand, you have Kallen, the hot-headed ace pilot who is determined to reclaim Japan's freedom; Cornelia, who does a very good job at being the villain/hero (depending on whose side you're on); and Lelouch, the magnificent schemer who slowly falls further into darkness. Being the main character, he gets the most character development, initially seeming apathetic towards the casualties of his fight against Britannia, and all the bloodshed starts taking its toll, both emotionally and psychologically.\nOn the other hand, there are characters that annoyed me for whatever reason. For example, we have Suzaku, who is very much against violence claims that he will fight to change Britannia from the inside despite doing nothing more than keeping his own people under the Empire's thumb; and then there's Nina, who honestly doesn't seem to serve any sort of purpose to the story whatsoever. She was the one that pissed me off the most, really, and every time she's on-screen, I wonder just why is she there.\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nCode Geass is one of those anime that will always be talked about, either in a positive light (fanbase who defend the show against every argument) or a negative light (haters bashing it at every turn). Either way, try to ignore the hype and the spoilers floating all over the internet, and give it a watch. I'm not saying to drop everything and watch it now, but place it high on your priority list."},

If I was a secular reviewer, I would too!

The voice work is really great in the dub, unfortunately I haven't time to watch the subbed version.\nLelouch's geass is really cool btw :3\nNow to the negatives...\nNegatives: THESE ARE BASED ON MY VALUES AS A CATHOLIC TEEN\nSwearing (in the dubbed) is kept a the Damn and Hell level... Very rarely did I hear a Bastard, and I never heard Fuck or Goddammit, which in itself is a positive.\nThere is two unexpected topless flashes in the series, this is really why I gave this series a 7... There is no more explicit toplessness or nudity, but in one episode a girl is seen masturbating on a table edge, it is dark and nothing else is seen. There is one shower scene as I remember, and it is blurred out. The only other sexual thing could be that how Kallen pilots her Guren is suggestive.\nThere isn't too much blood and there is NO gore in the series, but there is enough blood to spook anyone under 13...\n----------\nThis series is WAY to dark for anyone under 13, and I recommend that parents watch this before their kids, so they can get a feel for it.  While it can be considered a masterpiece, it still has it's moral flaws\nI give Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion a 7 (while it IS a masterpiece, it has gaping moral flaws)\nThanks for taking time to read my review :D contact me if you have any questions!

Kaizoku Ganzak, s-CRY-ed) and written by Ichiro Okouchi, present an excellent source of entertainment and.\nStory\nLike much Mecha animes, Code Geass presents an alternate universe/reality ruled by the Holy Britannian Empire, the world's largest superpower.\nOn August 10th, 2010 a.t.b, the Empire overcome the Japanese militar power by the use of the new belic-weapon, the Knightmare Frames. Japan is renamed\n          \n        to Area 11, and it's citizen are designated as 'elevens', with their rights stripped away. It's when the story of Code Geass starts.\nLelouch vi Britannia, eleventh prince of the Empire, upset with his mother's death, rebel against his father and is sent to Area 11 under the name 'Lelouch Lamperouge', and has the ambition to obtain revenge on his father and crush the Empire by any means necessary. The story builds to the climax through some arcs, but the viewer isn't overwhelmed with information or bored with lak of plot. While the story goes on, some questions are answered but new ones appear, this mistery is what hook your atention to Code Geass.\n• Pros: Nice action, moral oriented story. Long mistery - the viewer always want to discover and see more. A few 'light' (a.k.a. Fanservice) episodes placed very well.\n• Bads: A few scenes may turn people off - some parts may seem excessively strange (read: Nina and the Table). Anyway, this is not only for mecha fans, but other anime fans too, you can watch it for either the great story or the awesome battles.\nBattles\nCode Geass has some of the best battle scenes I've ever seen. There's actually an technical team to give instructions, build/rebuild the Knightmares, battle strategies, ace pilots face off, real battlefield, and others. Code Geass is new twist on 'main-character-sudden-overpower-and-destroy-anyone' with intense battles, you don't know for sure they will win. And there's no way to determine by 'good always win' because you don't know who is 'good' and who is 'bad', thats other nice point of Geass. The battlefield throw them against each other and one has to lose, even if we like the characters on both sides. Combining this to the unique Knightmare Frames and powers from both the Rebels and the Empire, you get an awesome mecha series with very flexible battle scenes. The complexity of strategies and chaos of the battlefield gives you the impression that you are watching a real war right before your eyes.\nAnimation\nI'm a CLAMP Fan, but I have to say: the characters look great, Knightmares are beautiful, everything looks amazing. But the style may put people who are not used to it down, since the characters are very tall and thin (like the ones from xXxHoLic and other CLAMP characters) and the mass-production Knightmares are usually unimpressive and ordinary.\nSound\nI liked the sound effects a lot, they get along with the animation, what turned me off a bit were the Opening themes, in my opinion, the Openings are meant to make you excited to the anime (I usually watch some anime openings before buying or downloading it) and need good songs. Flow's song 'COLORS' it's nice, like the first opening, but Jinn's 'Kaidoku Funou' is much better when you hear the full-version (and the opening is basically the first with some new scenes). I still don't get the point of the last opening, made for a very very few episodes, and it's a bit strange, like if they were in a rush to do it.\nCode Geass is a mecha that appeal to more than action and mech fans. It is very well projected, for exemple: characters are victims of their own (and others') actions and actually feel it and regret their past actions, but can't change them, something usually slip from the writer's hands on other animes/mangas.\n        "},

			{["score"]=6, ["helpful"]=5, ["text"]="                          \n    Code Geass is a fairly well plotted sci-fi melodrama hampered by an abundance of dull archetypal characters who exist only to drive the plot and a premise so tired that I once accidentally called Area 11 Airstrip One. Not to fear, though—the dull, twentieth century totalitarianism of Britannia is distinguished very well by their disastrously stupid leaders, whose decision-making seems based less upon rational self-interest and more upon creating emotionally manipulative drama for the viewer. The most egregious example of this is the climax of the first season, in which the second most senior member of Area 11's government (nominally speaking, at least) is allowed\n          \n        to meet a known terrorist alone in an empty room. The results are predictable. To her credit, the charming naiveté of said member of government can at least be acknowledged as well-intentioned and comparatively productive when you consider that most other senior officials in Britannia are characterized superficially as buffoonish, trigger-happy, or both. How this supposedly great empire conquered a third of the inhabited world is far beyond me.\nLike most anime aimed at the shounen demographic, many of the characters in Code Geass HAVE NO INSIDE VOICE. Luckily, protagonist Lelouch avoids this by talking exclusively in a smarmy, nasal gloat, usually while pressing his hands into his face in the most ungainly configuration he can manage, looking for all the world as if he has a motor control problem; however, while he is eminently unlikeable, Lelouch is nonetheless a good character who avoids archetypal blandness. Suzaku is less distinct but still well characterized. Fan favorite CC is also no doubt deserving of the praise that she's received—her shift between cool, defensive sarcasm and genuine sweetness makes it all too easy to classify her as yet another tsundere and leave it at that, but it would sell her short.\nThere are a few more exceptions that could be brought up, but unfortunately, most of the fairly large cast exists purely to drive the plot and possess totally forgettable personalities. There'll be one or two that any given viewer will appreciate on the basis of preference—Euphemia hit the moe sweet spot for me, with her gentle, forgiving heart—but at the end of the day, they're undeveloped archetypes with little to recommend them as fully rounded characters outside of the context of the plot. This becomes most evident during the school life episodes, which are borderline unwatchable for a slice-of-life fan. The show needed more dialogue for its own sake and characterization that wasn't paper-thin—the passionate rebel, the zany scientist, the snobbish noble, etc.\nThere are several impressive action sequences featuring the Knightmare mecha, which I'm sure would be of interest to people who like impressive action sequences featuring mecha. Frankly, it's not my area, and I spent a lot of the time during action scenes laughing at the awkward, upright position that the Gawain mecha adopted whenever it started flying. It's hardly an informed opinion, but they appeared fairly great from the perspective of someone who doesn't like mecha, so it's perhaps something to bear in mind.\nIn all fairness, Code Geass is by no means a bad anime, but it's a severely flawed one. It offers the viewer a decent story decently told, and though it's hurt by its iffy characters, goofy worldbuilding, and the occasional plot contrivance, it's entertainment, and that's no bad thing. If you like shounen, this is probably more like a 7 or 8.\n        "},

The first few episodes might be a bit dull ( as with a lot of animes  ) but that should not stop you from watching , and if it did i feel really sorry for you . Code Geass has one of the most sophisticated characters out there which is a very positive point for the older audience who wouldn't  like watching these \" kid shows \" . Each character has his own philosophy and ideology for which he stands by and that is what i find great in\n          \n        this anime since it doesn't force you to like the main protagonist and his ideals , but gives you the option of choosing who you choose . \nJust to show you one of the many different ideologies i would like to share with you one of my favorite quotes from the main protagonist : “What do you do when there is an evil you cannot defeat by just means? Do you stain your hands with evil to destroy evil? Or do you remain steadfastly just and righteous even if it means surrendering to evil?” i really like this one since i relate to it in real life and by the time you finish this anime you'll be thinking long and hard about decisions you take and what path you follow to make them. \nYou also get very attached to some of the characters , at one point in the second part of the serie i almost started shedding manly tears  . \nSo from a guy who's been watching animes since birth i highly recommend watching this because it's quite unique.

It has memorable action sequences, fantastic characters, and one of the best anime endings - the best, in my opinion - ever. Except... that's all in part two. This isn't part two.\nCode Geass R1 is very easy to rap up, I think. If anyone has seen Dragon Ball Z, it has a similar feel to it - or at least it did for me. The characters aren't anything special, but you become attached to them and they are enjoyable to watch and relate to. The story isn't really all that important or original, especially\n          \n        when it's another tale of fighting against an oppressive, foreign government. The art is fine, except that all of the character's have such skinny bodies and long limbs they look like octopuses sometimes.\nNow, in all seriousness, I really did enjoy this anime. It's pure fun, and it's always enjoyable to watch Lelouch, the main character, find a way out whatever situation he is in. Despite my fairly apathetic attitude that I have displayed thus far, I have to say, I was never bored with this first season. It constantly entertained me, even when it was just some dumb high school hijinks episode, and had that addicting feel that made me want to watch the next episode.\nI recommend it, especially because it leads into part two. And I ALSO think you should look at my review for that as well.\n        "},

Both main characters want the rights to make justice but knowing they happen to go nuts later on. Both want to make it a peaceful world though difference be Light using the DEATHNOTE with sidekick RYUK love eating apples in a reality modern world JAPAN and LULU having the GEA's eyes with sidekick C.C. love eatting PIZZA in late 21st Century who Britannian took over Japan now called Area 11. You know, i prefer the pizza since that makes\n          \n        me hungry mmmm. Read from fans giving praise in Anime News Network including here, so gave it a shot. let me say it was worth it.\nI never actually saw a Mecha anime series to tell you the truth. I have seen others in commericals and seemed to be bad how it looked with no story. Then, when I saw this, I was impressed by it. Showing Mecha wars going on between Britannian vs Area 11 vs Japanese than go back to getting to know the characters before back to action war scenes.  Though have to say kind of made me think of IRON MAN with TRANSFORMER STYLE. When think of it, it kind of does but a ton of them. \nThe Story what impressed was not one is actually a super hero or a villian in this. You might think that you don't want to join any sides between Britannian or AREA 11 when getting to know each of the characters. though be a misunderstanding but way they are having this war is truly a mess that shouldn't happen. though of course Britannian cause the problem first taking Japan away but knowing should they find away to bring peace with each other or will it? \nThe Art like you see in Tsubasa Chronicles but though much tense and little bit darker. \nFor enjoyment, i watched each episode two days straight. 10 episodes on Memorial day MONDAY when disappointed didn't get to see Indiana Jones with a friend but this made my day. Next day Tuesday 4 episodes in the morning on and finished all the rest in evening till pass midnight when something was canceled what i want to do AGAIN lol. WORTH IT WORTH IT.\nThe ending is a cliffhanger so now i want to see the second season which is already airing in JAPAN right now. Can't wait till put in subtitles online \n        "},

Lelouch had to live in Area 11 (Japan), and because of his royal status, was treated horribly by the Elevens (Japanese). His only goal is to make a better world for his sister Nunnally, and to find what really happened to his mother. \nThe story is totally original, full of uncertainty at times, funny when it can, and really dramatic. A+.\n\nArt:\nAnother wonder of Code Geass is it's character designs. What really blew me away are the designs of the Knightmare\n          \n        Frames, a big essential piece of the Code Geass puzzle. Everything just seems to fit in.\nSound:\nCode Geass has the best background music of all times. Most are sung by the ever talented, Hitomi. The staff definitely knew when to put these awesome tracks. It's first Opening, Colors, was a hit for me. The dramatic scenes and the introduction of new characters had it really well. Next was Kaidoku Funou, another success.  A+. The English dub of the series was another win, i really liked Lelouch's dub, Cornelia's dub and Lloyd's dub the most. Everyone else was ok. Japanese version was (of course) excellent.\nCharacters:\nWell, you got the former Prince of the Britannian Empire, a green-haired Pizza loving witch, A 'Sasuke' like clone who fights for Britannia (Suzaku), and the table-humping mad scientist (Nina). A well-mixed group of people. The staff balanced out the different kinds of characters fairly well.\nOverall:\nCode Geass is a show you MUST see, whether or not you watch it in English or Japanese, it's just win. There aren't alot of good shows out there anymore, so savor this one up. Make sure to watch the sequel!\n        "},

I was tempted many times to read the wiki because I felt like the anime moved\n          \n        too slowly for me, but still kept watching because I knew I would regret missing some of the small details that the writers threw in. I love how the writers keep the interactions between the characters very tight, and more than once had me yelling at the screen because once again two of the main characters refuse to see each other. \nArt 7/10: The character design for me seems to be a little more realistic than I would like, but is still great.\nSound 8/10: Standardish anime music. Nothing outstanding.\nCharacter 9/10: The characters in the story all have their own reasons for doing what they do, and made me support them no matter which side they were on. Kudos to the writers for creating such amazing characters. However, there are a few people whom I feel contributed little to the anime, but nevertheless are in it. Though they don't detract too much from the main story, I wish the authors focused more on the main characters and the realtionships/struggles they face.\nEnjoyment 8/10: Enjoyable, but still somewhat disappointed at some parts in the anime.\nOverall 8/10: This is a great anime to pick up for anyone who enjoys shounens such as Naruto. But for the diehard shoujo fan I am, it's decent, but not chair gripping worthy.\n        "},

Thinking back, I didn't know what kind of story I was about to get dragged into. The characters in this world are unique and diverse, making clear points on ethnicity and diversity when most animes ignore it. Code Geass also makes social statements on racism, how the \"Winners\" of war react to their former enemies, clash of classes, and finally, on the age old question, is it wrong to accomplish good by doing evil?\nThe story and character devolpment were by\n          \n        far the strongest points of Code Geass, building up the characters so that we can see changes in their personalities and relationships with one another, while all tieing back to the story. Lelouch alone is a complex and meaningful character, having both good and evil tied into him. He is by far, the defination of anti-hero, dealing in terrorism and warfare to accomplish his goals. But he's also human, caring for his crippled sister and protecting his friends. He is human, or as close to a human as Pixels can get.\nStory-10\nCharacter-10\nThe art and sound where also complimentary, with clean visuals and a nice soundtrack to keep pace with the story. Though sometimes in the subbed you could hear voice actors being recycled into different characters, these where only minor flaws. \nArt-9\nSound-9\nEnjoyment-10\nThe reason I enjoyed it was simply because it was a truly unique story, dealing in topics most directors tried to avoid simply because of how they could backfire on them. Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch (Japanese) or Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion, is a must see if you are into darker stories that still manage to maintain a light aspect (on occasion).\nOverall-10\n        "},

Fans of mechs, dizzying plot twists, rapidly paced action and storytelling, or just anime in general will likely fall in love with this series.\nI found myself positively rabid for the next episode, every episode. The character art is distinct and beautiful in every sense of the word, the mechs are meticulously detailed and have a strange balance between practical and almost mystical technology to them, and the animation is fluid and professional. I've seen enough anime to easily recognize\n          \n        most story plot patterns miles away, but I was astounding at every twist and turn of the plot, until late in the series when I started to predict some of the events and characters' actions... but not because the writing was predictable, but because I KNEW the characters as PEOPLE.

Plus there is a new type of mech shown here, the Knightmare, and its design is not totally similar to Gundams at first but as you continue with the story they will eventually resemble one.\nAnyway, this series has the elements of a plot of war as shown by Gundam Seed, and the intellectual twists and turns presented by Death Note.

I was a bit saddened by the last episode, first because Suzaku became a jerk, and second because the ending wasn't really clear.

			{["score"]=7, ["helpful"]=2, ["text"]="                          \n    Code Geass is about an incredibly smart high-school student who wants to recreate the world in his vision with his power he obtains. It does have a lot of similarities to Death Note but is not quite the same. Although, the main character Lelouch is almost exactly like Light Yagami from Deathnote.\n The Art in this anime is great and the action scenes are really well done and fun to watch. You can tell they put a lot of time into animating it well.\n The sound is good nothing I immediately noticed, and the openings are okay but what does stand out is the soundtrack\n          \n        is very well done. At times it can be emotional and at times very epic.\nThe Characters are very good and all have their well thought back stories.\nThere is a lot of enjoyment to be had in this anime especially if you watch the second installment.\nThe story is well planned out but at the end of this part of the anime you have more questions than anything else. Another thing is that somethings in the anime are not very believable. For instance how such a controlling state does not have better surveillance and doesn't pour barely any resources into finding out who Zero is. The amount that Lelouch gets away with in the beginning is a little far fetched. Another point that is a little lacking in this anime is that a lot of times they don't show you how Lelouch really does his genius they just kind of tell you he is super smart and your supposed to believe him. Most of the time they don't really go too in depth into his plans, whereas in Deathnote we saw Kira's plan every step of the way and exactly how he did it.\nOverall this anime is really enjoyable but has a few flaws, but has a huge pay off at the end if you watch it all. The pay off is arguably much better than Deathnote's.\n        "},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=4, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I loved it. From top to bottom, I don't think I've been more pleased by an anime in a long, long time.\nThe show follows Lelouch Lamperouge, a cold, calculating genius with a messiah complex who is given the ability to make anyone do anything. In the alternate universe the show is set in, the Great British Empire has expanded and controls a third of the world, including Japan, where the show takes place. Soon after the start of the series, Lamperouge begins commanding a group a Japanese rebels as though it was a game of chess; he anticipates the enemy's actions, calculates every scenario that\n          \n        can occur, and dominates the battlefield.\nI won't go too deep into how the story plays out from there, though. After the second episode (where I cut off), it really needs to be seen. I do have a few gripes, though. The chess motif is great, and while it plays out, I enjoyed it. However, as the series goes on, a certain pilot continues to break through Lamperouge's plans. I find this to be a very poor choice. Considering how Lelouch is built up in the first six or seven episodes, as someone who can calculate every possible scenario and react to them all, it seems to be in very poor style to then have one specific character, in one specific mech, foiling his plans constantly. For whatever reason, this genius fails to account for the Empire's ace-in-the-hole. How does that happen?\nDespite this, though, the drama and irony created by this choice far outweighs the plot hole. I won't go into too much detail about it, but sufficed to say, it works really well. I can forgive the plot hole.\nThe casting and voice work are excellent. Johnny Young Bosch voices the main character, and there's definitely enough of him in there to tell who's doing the voice, but this character is far different from what Bosch usually plays, and he does this character justice. Every other voice in the show gets the job done, and well, but I felt that Bosch was the most notable for going far outside of his normal, happy-go-lucky, carefree characters that he is cast as so often. The only thing I thought was odd was that, despite it being the Great British Empire in Japan, all of the GBE soldiers had American accents. I suppose when you control a third of the world, a lot of the soldiers are going to be from other countries, but then why are these soldiers (and civilians, too) so obsessed with \"true Britannians\"? Considering that they clearly aren't British, the characters' motivations for hating and degrading the former-Japanese seems a bit odd. Still, I liked the voice work regardless.\nThe character design was done by CLAMP, a company known for the quality of its work. They do not disappoint. Everyone in the show seems like they fit their roles. I was especially impressed by the design of Lelouch and his rebel forces.\nMusic in this show was also impressive. It was placed almost perfectly in a lot of spots, but it also came as almost inconsequential. Every time the sound designers launched us into a triumphant cadence or slow ballad, it was covered up by everything else that was going on, to the point that the music was getting in the way. It's sad that such a great soundtrack was squandered in the actual series.\nFinally, though I spoke about the plot, I'd like to talk about the characters. Every character in this show is well-written, and at the very least, somewhat interesting. The best character dynamic, and one that plays throughout the whole series, is the dividing opinions between Lelouch and his classmate, Suzaku Kururugi. Lelouch believes that, through the destruction of the British Empire, he can establish a new world, with true peace, and that any means to this end are justified. Kururugi feels that the Empire must be changed from within, and that, in his words, \"anything gained through contemptible means is worthless.\" This establishes the foundation of a debate among fans, and plays well within the series.\nAll in all, I have to say that this was one of the best anime series I've seen in a long time. Despite some nitpicks about the plot and some poor choices regarding sound design, I will recommend nearly everyone watch it.\n        "},

His intentions are good, and no matter what evils he commits, as an audience we always feel our beliefs aligning with his - everything he does is for Nunnally.\nThe empathy inspiring characters are the ultimate merits of this anime, the presentation of backstories like Kallen, mystery like C.C, Euphemia's hope, and Suzaku's loyalty, all contributing to the mass love fans have for Code Geass.\nSecondly, the story is pretty damn intricate.\n          \n        It's a whole new universe, where alliances have changed, and power is shifted. There is an immense acceleration in technology, and the supernatural element exists. Lelouch possesses the coolest power out - the ability to control people. The clever ways in which he manipulates battle strategy, his identity, his friends, and also his enemies, lead to an intelligent character, and a very interesting story.\nI think the only detriment to the story is the characters who JUST WON'T DIE. I won't spoil it for anyone, but my god just stay dead please.\nAnother awesome factor of Code Geass is the art and manipulation of it in animation. The characters are unique, grand, appropriate, and have a definitive style. The action is fast paced, engaging, and unique to each situation - this is animated perfectly, the Nightmare Frames appropriately and successfully represented as a machine, but also an extension of their controllers themselves.\nThe characters are also easily defined by way of voice acting. The crew (English dub and Japanese) utilise rhythm as required to present interesting scenes of drama as well as action. Good quality stuff.\nOverall, I definitely recommend Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch (and its sequel) to every anime lover - it is a must watch for any genre specific audiences, and I guarantee there is some element for everyone to find to love in this anime.\n        "},

But one thing I will say is that I don't think people should be reccomending other mecha shows for people who like code geass.  This show was about so much more than the mecha fighting.  Sure, the mecha stuff was cool and well done, but it was only really there to show off Lelouch's amazing strategic mind (like a big game of chess).  Yes this show had action in it, but that wasn't what made it awesome.  It had everything.  It was thought provoking, profound, philsophocal, grabbing, and even had some\n          \n        romance it in.  Even the voice acting was the single best english dub I have ever heard.

And if you do too, you'll enjoy Code Geass just as much as I did.\nThe plot, for starters, was nothing short of brilliant. The backstories of the main characters are fledged out sufficiently, without being too far fetched. Also, the plot may have its dark moments (observe the pwnage Zero deals out), but this is contrasted by its lighthearted comedic scenes (chase that cat!). Not to mention the Mechas. Ah, the Gawain. \nThe artwork, done by CLAMP, seemed a bit odd for a Mecha anime at first, but they proved to be a lot more fitting than I expected. Even\n          \n        the Mecha scenes were well animated, and kept the adrenaline pumping.\nThe music was, on the whole, alright. The BGMs were all quite standard, but in terms of the OPs and EDs, I only liked the first OP (Colors - FLOW) and the last ED ( Mosaic Kakera - Sunset Swish). The others were, well, meh.\nThe characters, however, were what really attracted me to this show. Lelouch, on his quest for vengeance against the Emperor, is starkly contrasted by his longtime friend Suzaku, who opted to change the Brittanian empire from the inside. As Zero, Lelouch has no qualms about using Human lives like chess pieces to carry out his plans, while Suzaku is completely against the idea of killing anyone (for now) (also, a walking contradiction, since he joined the army. Go figure). One of the highlights of the show was watching these two old friends clash on the battlefield. It adds a weird sense of realism to it all.\nOverall, even if you watch it just for the Mecha action, Code Geass is a series that I highly recommend to anyone interested.\n        "},
			{["score"]=7, ["helpful"]=4, ["text"]="                          \n    For months, people were nagging me to check out what hundreds consider the best anime ever: Code Geass, and I finally decided to give in and see what all the fuss was about. To be honest, I'm still not sure 100 percent, but I'll give my personal take regardless.\nTo start off, I'll get the positives out of the way. Brilliant plot. Overall, the story and pacing of Lelouch and his rebellion's uprising was spread out diligently. Each factor of Lelouch's tactics and his battle plans amazed me in terms of his stealth and cunning tactics. He's truly one of the more interesting and shrewd protagonists\n          \n        I've seen to date, and needless to say, that's only amplified by Johnny Yong Bosch, who does a terrific job as Lelouch. The main character, like the plot, can also be complex at times, with a near-obsession to overthrow Britania all for the sake of his family, yet  it's hard at times for the viewer to decide whether it's right to sympathize with him or to object to some of his notions. That complexity makes him a perfect counter for Suzaku who's your average goody-two-shoes and serves Lelouch's enemy; the Holy Britannian Empire. Unlike Lelouch though, Suzaku makes sure that what needs to be said and done is enforced rightfully and the tension between these two comes alive and full-throttle during their battles, which leads me to the next pro.\nI'm not the biggest fan of Mecha-genres, but in Code Geass, the overall battles between the Black Knights and the Britannian Empire, as repetitive as they can get, are not just interesting in their design, but are about as intense as bloodshed gets! Code Geass isn't afraid to depict the horror of combat on the battlefield and when these Knightmare Frames come face to face, it's really alluring to the view in both detail and the strategy played out by both sides.\nOverall, the plot and these battles are a good majority of the series and as great as I find them, there are also my personal and minor gripes about the series that detour me from saying that Code Geass is one of the greatest animes I've seen. For one, the rest of the characters. Aside from Lelouch, Suzaki and C2, most of the other characters are bland and tedious, not to mention some of them are also quite irritating! Unlike some of my favorites like FullMetal Alchemist and Fairy Tail, many of these supporting characters don't register completely in development and by the time of the series' end, a lot of them are quite forgettable. \nThe fanservice. And this is a biggie for me. Unless fanservice serves some kind of point to the scene (however small it usually is), it's only mere and annoying breast and panty shots in the viewer's faces distracting them from the actual scene. For me, fanservice, in cases like Seto No Hanayome, works well when associated with comedy or to elicit a humorous reaction from the characters. But in Code Geass, usually whenever Kallen shows up screen, it's walking fanservice that overstays its welcome and serves no point to the scenes.\nAlso, as I said above and this is a nitpick, many of the Black Knights' attacks with the Knightmare Frames can grow quite repetitive; usually beginning with Lelouch organizing some intelligent scheme, and then Suzaku and the Lancelot show up and put a dent in the plan.  The battles are interesting themselves, but the way they're drawn out all fall in a similar manner.\nOverall, Code Geass does make it as one of my favorite animes to date, but I certainly don't think it makes it as a complete masterpiece in my opinion. I guess when it comes right down to it, Code Geass isn't exactly what I had expected, but it's an entertaining show nonetheless. \n        "},

			{["score"]=7, ["helpful"]=4, ["text"]="                          \n    Oh Code Geass, great holder of 14# and often called Death Note with mechas. While I wouldn't call it anything but great, both those titles are completely undeserved.\nCode Geass has a great concept. Oh the words that have begun on many a failure, but manages to execute it 'fairly' well. To make a first for this site, I wont recap the synopsis and actually follow the rules that are very clearly to the right of me as I'm writing this. It executes it fairly well, however the comparison between it and Death Note is completely unjustified. There are similarities yes. It begins by appearing to\n          \n        have dual and polar protagoni before focusing nearly entirely on the 'evil' character, the evil character's biggest tool is both his brain and newly found supernatural ability and the evil character slowly more and more 'evil'. \nThese similarities however are bare-bones. It lacks the interesting mind games of Death Note, as well as lacking a philosophy discussion starting plot, and the two main characters are not directly against each other. Whats more, Code Geass's shock moment that is supposed to represent Lelouch's completely discard of morality near the end actually makes him seem like a better person, and is partially caused by a sudden inconsistency in his character which is never explained.\nBut enough unfair comparisons it to a true masterpiece (well, a true single season of masterpiece). The plot is ok. It is interesting and has a few twists and turns. However many of the minor twists come from Lelouch suddenly pulling an ace out of his ass and causing massive strategic victories. These would be far more interesting if it didn't feel like deus ex machina's every single time. As these traps are never hinted on at any point in the anime before hand, and often cause Lelouch to appear to have near psychic powers. One time early on, I swear he literally conjured a cruise liner from empty air, and teleported people hundreds of metres onto said boat. When the best parts of the anime are these twists, such sloppy writing is unforgivable. \nHowever what I must commend it for is being the first anime I've ever seen, nor show really, that has managed to make an entire series not have any drawn out feeling scenes, nor make the reverse mistake of having a rushed scene.  That takes sheer talent or incredible luck to pull off. Still,  I cant give it too many points for this, as sometimes a drawn out anime can actually improve it. Attack on Titan is a shining example of incredibly drawn out scenes making an anime many many times better then without, although many do not agree with me in that aspect, but I digress.\nFinally, on another but altogether shorter complaint, the mecha addition does nothing for the show, and serves no purpose. They could be removed and the show could easily be slightly rewritten and nothing would change. A needless aspect should be a non-existent aspect of a show. The only purpose of the mechas is to cash in on mecha fans. However it never really hurts the anime, it's just pointless.\nThe animation and art of Code Geass is wonderful and fluid, but while I'm able to give multiple paragraphs on the story of an anime in the utmost highest of the English language, describing art is a challenge for me. So uh...its good. It's very very good. You will think its good as well when you watch it.\nYeah.\nOn the sound, anime list's infamously strange category. I personally watched the English dub. Put down the brick, no I cant see you your just predictable. I watched the first five minutes of both the original and English dub. The English dub is fine. There is just as many, if not more silly sounding parts in the Japanese dub as the English dub, and every character displays the correct levels of emotion in every scene that matters. Even in the second season (which I'm not factoring into the rest of this review) which was supposed to mark a suddenly massive drop in quality, has great voice acting jobs all around with the exception of Shirley who's voice actor apparently lost the part of the script that said context to her lines, causing her to somehow display the opposite emotion in nearly every scene she's in. (she's perfectly fine in Season 1 however).\nOn an offhand note, the voice actor for Lelouch is the same as Light Yagami from Death Note, as if they were trying desperately to make people call it Death Note with mechas. \nThe soundtrack, as much as everyone seems to adore it, is simply competent. There is no memorable tracks at all, even if they direct emotion at a satisfactory level. The openings and closings are some of the less fitting I've seen. This is not the incredible masterpiece of a soundtrack everyone else seems to think it is. It's painfully competent, and nothing more. Attack on Titan's soundtrack is an incredible masterpiece that is always fitting and always epic, not this.\nAh the characters. Their pretty good. It's hard to really go much more into this without spoiling things. Only complains is that Lelouch grows less evil by the end like they make out and more inconsistently written. Also when he makes an innocent mistake later on that has dire consequences, the anime seems to be trying to say he's a horrible person for not being perfect. Aside from that, there is a good amount of development from all the characters, and there a varied bunch. \nOn enjoyment? While I've mostly had negatives so far, I somehow enjoyed my time and found it a worthwhile watch. Which in the end, as Attack on Titan showed me, is all that really matters isn't it? Still, I firmly will call this simply a 'good' anime. It's not a masterpiece, it in no way deserves to be so highly ranked, and does nothing new in the anime scene outside of having proper pacing which my decaying memory seems to state ironically Death Note did such a thing first. Regardless, after trying and failing to get into One Piece for having the very problem of horrendous pacing, its good to see that not all animes have bad pacing.\nJust most of them.\n        "},

So, one of my friends recommended it to me (for the fiftieth time, I should say...) and I tried it.\nThis anime is definitely my number #1, which surprised me at first, because I'm not exactly into mecha.\nSTORY: The story completely blew me away. Every twist and turn in it had me on the edge of my seat. It constantly shocked me. I really don't like mecha, but the fighting robots were awesome. 'Nuff said. \n      Though the whole genius-schoolboy thing seems a little cliche to my friends--and\n          \n        maybe it is sort of cliche--the story wouldn't work without it. \n      And the ending, though very unhappy, was amazing. It made this anime seem more \"real\" to me; un-cliche. Not everyone get an happy ending, but because of this, other people are able to. \nART: At first, I didn't like the art, and I'm still not very crazy about it. The chins seemed too pointy, the hair too floofy. But I got used to it, and have grown to like it.\n      The animation was not the most beautiful I've seen, but it could be worse. Even said, the art fits the anime, so I wouldn't be worried.\nSOUND: I very much thought the music fit the anime really well. I liked all the voices, especially Japanese-Lelouch, which sounded sort of dark. The dub wasn't bad at all, though, it's just that the same person who voices Ichigo from Bleach also voices Lelouch, so it makes watching it feel weird.\nCHARACTERS: Okay, I absolutely loved the characters. I don't like \"do-no-wrong\" characters, honestly. That's why I liked Lelouch so much. He may not be the pinnacle of goodness (or manliness, according to his pink apron), but, hey, who is?\n      The characters had good depth, I believe, except for C2. But she's supposed to be mysterious, anyways.\n      The characters (Except for maybe Lelouch, because main characters are usually \"do-no-wrong\") are pretty much what you find in a lot of books/animes. The girl who crushes hard on on the main character but never ends up with him. The good guy turn bad. The innocent one who gets caught in the crossfire, ect.\nOVERALL: This anime is freaking AMAZINGLY awesome. It will never get old, as I've watched it seven times already. The only problem is the ending, because after I finish it, I spend the rest of my day curled into the fetal position and crying my eyes out."},

The story is amazing, the art and animation is great, sound is surprisingly awesome. \nI found the story to be unique: a typical high school student who stumbles upon a mysterious girl and receives the power of the king to fight the tyrannical government. \nThere were lots of cliff-hangers and each episode made you want to see the next one. \nCharacters were developed nicely, and each has their own interesting background. \nThe animations were awesome, all of the robot fight\n          \n        scenes were just stunning and character designs are beautiful.\nI saw this anime in English Dub, and i found it surprisingly well voiced when considering other anime's english dubs.

There is some excess of Deus ex Machina use in the plot, and some people may find the action to be over the top. However, I found that the elements of fantasy made the show a very fun and light experience. Definitely worth watching.\n*Premise* The show takes place in a futuristic world where the Holy Britannain Empire rules over a third of the globe. Their emperor's conquest has\n          \n        lead them to Japan, which they conquered easily due to their superior military technology (machines called Nightmares). Japan is renamed area 11, and it is here, 8 years after Britannia's invasion that the story begins. The protagonist is Lelouch Lamperouge, a high school student who is given a power called Geass, which he uses to wage war against the Britannian Empire.\n*The Pros* After finishing \"Death Note\" and loving it, I started looking for similar series, and this was one that was recommended all over the place. After watching 2 episodes, I became hooked and finished the series (including r2) in 3 days. Fans of Death Note will enjoy Code Geass, although I must say it doesn't have the same dark mood as Death Note. \nThis is an excellent series for anyone looking for suspenseful & exciting action & drama. The protagonist, Lelouch, is an excellent strategist and tactician, and his brilliant tactics as he battles the forces of Britannia, the world's largest empire, will keep you craving more. While the action of the series is largely centered around mecha, I can assure you it isn't simply a nonstop explosive battle. Much of the focus is on plan & strategy execution, and drama that keeps the story rolling.\nThe artwork is incredible.\n*The Cons* At times, characters & dialogue can become over-dramatic or oversimplified. Lelouch's sister, Nunnally, for example is almost so sweet that it makes you sick, and sometimes characters shout & gesture in excess of dramatic effect.\nMy overall impression is at the top, and I absolutely recommend this series to anyone looking for an exciting ride.\n        "},

Sometimes we see his personal emotions and reactions to situations as though he hadn't planned for it, when in the end they show how he planned based in predicting the possible outcomes.This kind of makes him appear more genious than he might have actually been.\n(-minor spoiler-)\nAnyhow it adds to the grand theatrical performance of him leading the show as a masked man who moves a nation(area 11) by season-1 and moves the whole world by during season - 2. \nThe tide of the battle sees a lot of  'nick of time saving' by an unexpected command/involvement of their leader(Lelouch). The clash of strategy driven rebellions and the tactically motivated imperial army is entertaining(for mecha lovers to observe). The plot is closes with the end if the big game which comprised of three wars between the rebellions and Britannia. The masked man goes down in history as the hero who led the liberation of Japan and lead the world - is symbolised as the hope of the future - for the sake of the future.\n((It definitely was a great watching experience (Y)))\n        "},

It wastes absolutely no time getting you hooked, and is one of only 2 or 3 series that I've seen which doesn't have a single dull episode. As the story centers around the Japanese resistance to Britannia, much of the show is filled with fantastic mecha fights, but even when there isn't fighting the characters are so entertaining and interesting and the plot so well developed that I was never bored. More than just a mecha anime with a nice story, Geass focuses on the symbolic battle between Suzaku and Lelouch over the moral and efficient way to deal with the rule of the Britannian Empire and the resulting subjugation of the Japanese people; this culminates in an intense ending that will have you rushing to watch R2.\nGeass' animation is bright, beautiful, and features superb character design. Fights are fast-paced and never repetitive, and a heavy focus on Lelouch's use of tactics makes them superior to those in your typical mecha series. The OST is very nice, creating suspense and capturing the mood of nobility life perfectly: of note are \"Cold Nobility,\" \"Occupied Thinking,\" and \"Nobless Oblige.\" While both voice casts are exceptional, the English cast really shines with an all-star group including Johnny Bosch (Ichigo in Bleach, Kiba in Wolf's Rain), Yuri Lowenthal (Sasuke in Naruto, Kuma in Afro Samurai), and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn (The Major in GitS, Lady Jagura in Wolf's Rain, Julia in Cowboy Bebop). All of this comes together to make Geass a wonderfully addictive, well-presented anime that must be seen.\nAnimation: 9.2/10\nAudio: 9.2/10\nStoryline: 9.5/10\nOverall Score: 9.4/10 (Masterpiece)\nFor snapshots and high quality episodes/OST downloads check out my blog at http://animefiend.blogspot.com.\n        "},

It is very straightforward and you may guess how it ends from the very beginning. Sometimes things get too convenient for the main characters so that they can pull through different situations. The story gets boring near the end making you sense that the producer wanted to wrap it up in as few episodes as possible.\nIf you like action animes with a dark-side to their story, you wont loose your time seeing this one and might like it very much.

Because that's pretty much how I feel about it, it's good. But when I looked at it again and thought, I realized I was being a bit of a Negative Nancy, and switched to an 8. Let me start this by saying, yes, I think it's Very Good, but I have problems that keep it from being higher.\n         My favorite thing about Code\n          \n        Geass is how it did something better than Death Note. DN is supposed to be both a intellectual and moral battle, but I never saw any side the it besides the intellectual one. Light is clearly in the wrong here, and L for all his faults is the hero. CG has one morally gray intelligent protagonist who seems to have a better idea, and one misguided and naive average-smarts protagonist. Not only that, but the friendship between them is played really well, and it really hit me in the heart.\n        So after all that praise, why do I feel like the rain on everybody's parade? Well, first off most of the High School plot seemed really out of place, and I'm glad it was excised in the second season. It also peaved me that Lelouch, a freaking genius, could have made things infinitely easier at many points by revealing at least part of the truth to certain people. But no, he gets confronted and shuts up, making him seem worse than he really is. I have a friend who tells me it's part of his character, but to me that's like saying that part of a character is that despite being super-intelligent, he can't fix a hole that keeps appearing in his plans over and over despite them being his greatest problem. It's lazy writing. But the worst part has to be C.C. She should be the image for the Plot Tumor trope. Who could easily cut her out of the entire story, and I wouldn't notice. All the things that she did could easily be done by other people, and she could have just stayed dead in episode one. Still, despite these problems I have, the show is still Very Good, and I would recommend it to many. It's just begging for a Fan Edit though. Maybe one that ends at episode 22... \n        "},

I didn't like the art in the beginning, it was different than what I normally watch\n          \n        BUT luckily the story is amazing and I watched until the end.

But it can't have been to bad or I would have noticed it more. So I give 7 points for this.\nCHARACTERS: They are amazing. Code Geass made it happen that everyone of the important characters could tell his/her own story while the main plot was happening. Every character was complicated but still you understand what they feel. \nENJOYMENT: I absolutely enjoyed Code Geass! There is a good mix of action and conversation. So everytime you nearly started to get bored with all the talk they switched it without problems to an action scene and back. \nOVERALL: For me, Code Geass is a must watch. Not only for the mecha genre but generally.\n"},

The ending was exciting, but as I started on the OAV, it was more like a feeble attempt at a reboot and I have to say I lost interest quickly.\nThere's no real surprises when it comes to character development, but the battle scenes are creative and always keep you on your toes. Plot-wise, you can guess where certain things will lead up to, which is a bit of a disappointment in that something that's supposed to be an exciting twist\n          \n        falls flat. \nI personally am not a huge Mecha fan, but I found myself being pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed Code Geass overall. I watched the entire series in one go, and there was a good flow across all of the episodes.\nSo, if you're in the mood for some light angst, guns blazing, rivalry, school shenanigans, and an easy-to-follow storyline, this would be the one for you.\n"},

Both anime share the the similar storyline of a talented youth acquiring a supernatural power to control people and fulfill their dream of making the world a better place. However Code Geass could not match that finesse of Death Note's execution although Code Geass seems to have more going for it (such as a larger scale of war, mecha and technology). While disappointed, I\n          \n        still kept on watching, it was good enough to hold my attention.\nThe show was already fast pace from the start, but it get more gripping as the episode progress. Lelouch, the male lead, used his powers to build an army from scratch. It is interesting to see that although his power allows him to give absolute orders to anyone in eye contact with him, Lelouch still has to overcome many difficulties to reach the top of the game. And so the game of wits and tactics begin, which is a great enjoyment to watch. Consistently comparing it with death note will only disappoint you. However, getting pass that comparison, Code Geass becomes a spectacular anime to watch. You will not regret it. Part 2 is even more gripping and the ending will surprise you.

			{["score"]=6, ["helpful"]=1, ["text"]="                          \n    Hi, everyone. \nI have made some reviews about shows that I love (well, not here), but now I’m going to review an anime, that, even though I enjoyed when I was a teenager, I don’t think it’s the great thing now and I’m here to explain why, but first I need to clarify a couple of things: first, this is a review from both seasons and second, there will be some spoilers, so if you haven't watched the show, I suggest, do not read the review.\nSynopsys.\nCode Geass is settled in the year 2010, where the fictional country Britannia has the control of almost each part\n          \n        of the world... one of those parts is Japan. There our main lead, Lelouch Lamperouge will gain super powers in order to defeat the devil empire... how it will turn out this? Let's see\nAnimation and music 9/10\nI usually don’t like to talk too much about animation and music, since I know too little about both aspects, so I will keep it short here. The animation was quite good, is was bombastic and dynamic through the battles, the faces were not deformed, there was attention to detail –even in the backgrounds–, I felt that the character design was pretty unique and the transition between frames didn’t felt rushed nor distorted. In the same line, the music worked very well, adding tension, sadness or joy to every moment on the screen, according to the emotion or feeling that the show was trying to convey. The first opening of the first season is pretty catchy, the rest is forgettable. Unfortunately for Code Geass, nice visuals and pretty colors is what I care less about an anime.\nStory 5/10\nThis is weakest part of the show; the premise is not original, since a great empire against a rebel army has been explored in anime too many times, to put an example there is Legend of the Galactic Heroes (who does a better job by the way), but that’s not the main problem –many shows have proven that having an unoriginal plot does mean nothing if you do it well–, the main problem resides in the execution. First of all, the tone of the series changes a lot and really quick; sometimes is a school comedy, then is a war drama, some others tries to deal with discrimination and segregation –but fails–, and end up being nothing more than fantasy empowerment for otakus. \nThe themes are treated on a very superficial level, why am I saying this? Because it’s very known by most of us (or at least that’s what I want to think) that war isn’t good against pure evil. There is good and bad in both sides and most of the times it’s difficult to say who’s wrong and who isn’t. The main antagonists in Code Geass are pure evil, even Charles didn’t have a good motivation (let’s remember that his main motivation was to create a world without lies) to explain everything he did, he was just one dimensional villain who wanted “destroy” the world. In the other hand, the good side is portrayed as nice guys who only want to create a fair world (the only one who’s not portrayed this way is Lelouch, but I will talk to him later). They never done anything wrong, and if they did –like the time they killed the children– they will blame Lelouch for giving the order, without any real consequences against them. \nAnother factor that decrease the quality of the show is the plot armor in every soldier of the good side. No one of the Knights die, and we’re talking about a war; people, especially the ones in the front line, die. Only Lelouch “dies”, well… that’s what we thought until the last year when we found out that he wasn’t really death. \nAnd the last factor that ruins the experience of the show, is the Geass itself. It´s just too convenient, like the time it was conveniently used to make Euphemia to kill all the Japanese; and like, in the end, to control everyone –I still don’t understand why he didn’t did that before– and bring peace by being a “martyr”. Also was used to delete the consequences of the war on Shirley, which I found deplorable. \nOn the good side, the pacing was really, really fast, there was almost always something happening on screen (except on some filler episodes, which were bad), so it does not let you to have time on what are you watching, you just want more, like when you eat a lot of junk food, it’s delicious, but pretty bad.\nCharacters 6/10.	\nThe only characters that I found to be interesting were Lelouch and C.C.; the rest of the cast was bland and two dimensional at best. Lelouch was interesting due to he, actually, showed different angles of his personality: he was nice and kind with his friends and sister, was merciless with the enemies of the rebellion (I just can’t stop of thinking how cool was when he killed those children), he was in pain when his loss some of his beloved ones; in the overall I found him to be likeable and well written. My issue is that any of those emotions is deeply explored and has no actual development, leaving him as a two dimensional character (he’s the same from the start to the end, is like any of the fact he went through really changed his way of thinking). \nC.C. does not show a large range of emotions as Lelouch, but her past story, motivation and personality are cool to watch. My issue with her is when the writers decided to transform her into the weak female, that every otaku would love to have as a waifu. \nIn the overall, I give Code Geass a 5.9/10, it was a mediocre, decent at best, war drama. If you want a well done war drama, let me suggest Legend of the Galactic Heroes or Area 88\nP.S. One factor I forgot is that it has a lot of fanservice without thematical exploration that justifies it… you failed again Code Geass. "},

It’s relatively political (fictional politics obviously), but I mostly ignored that kind of stuff and I understood the story fine. The main thing I like about this story is how it doesn’t always play out like you might expect. Since it doesn’t explain everything to you, it can just pull stuff out of nowhere that makes sense but also “twists” the plot in a surprising way. Once you finish season two, you can tell they had the whole thing (or at least most of it) planned ahead of time, because everything important starts developing early. I don’t like the ending of\n          \n        this season, though.\nArt: 78\nThe art overall looks okay, most everything except the characters is not particularly stylized, so it’s not really good or bad, but I do like the character designs, although some people don’t. I guess I’ve always liked that kind of tall and lanky way of drawing anime characters, but it’s not for everyone.\nSound: 87\nThe soundtrack is mostly unnoticeable to me, with the exception of one or two tracks that are really good. The voice acting was pretty good, again, no problems but nothing stuck out to me. The OP’s and ED’s for some reason always felt out of place, but one I got used to them, I thought they were amazing (except OP 3), but some are better than others.\nCharacters: 81\nThe characters themselves are fairly good, they aren’t one-dimensional, and even seemingly unimportant characters are fairly developed in the first half of the season. I’m not one to talk about character designs, but I never thought a design was completely un-fitting of a character, regardless of how they are all drawn. Since the show is two 25-episode seasons, character development happens relatively slowly, thus the seemingly low score.\nEnjoyment: 98\nI did really enjoy this show a lot. There is nothing really impactful that I actually disliked. I’m not a big fan of the mecha genre, but it’s not a mecha show, per-se, it’s more focused on the character interactions and psychology, and characters fight in more ways than just one. This is the only philosophy-heavy show where that didn’t feel forced to me. I can actually get behind some of it, and even when you can’t relate, you know why they feel the way they do, but it also doesn’t feel like the show is trying to impart values on me, the characters just have reasons, i.e. motivations, that are clearly explained and, like I said, make sense given their circumstances.\n        "},

CODE GEASS Lelouch of the Rebellion[8.5 points] (all 50 episodes, including R2)\nCode Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion (コードギアス 反逆のルルーシュ Kōdo Giasu: Hangyaku no Rurūshu), often referred to as simply Code Geass, is a Japanese anime series created by Sunrise, directed by Gorō Taniguchi, and written by Ichirō Ōkouchi, with original character designs by manga authors Clamp. Set in an alternate timeline, the series focuses on how the former prince Lelouch vi Britannia obtains a power known as Geass and decides to use it to obliterate the Holy Britannian Empire, an imperial monarchy and a superpower that has been conquering various countries.\nCode Geass first ran\n          \n        in Japan on MBS from October 5, 2006, to July 28, 2007. Its sequel series, Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2 (コードギアス 反逆のルルーシュR2 Kōdo Giasu Hangyaku no Rurūshu Āru Tsū), ran as a simulcast on JNN stations (like MBS and TBS) from April 6, 2008 to September 28, 2008. The series has also been adapted into various manga and light novels with the former showing various alternate scenarios from the TV series. Bandai Entertainment also licensed most parts from the franchise for English release in December 2007, airing the two TV series on Cartoon Network. Most manga and light novels have also been published in North America by Bandai.\nThe TV anime series has been well received in Japan, selling over a million DVD and Blu-ray Disc volumes. Both seasons have won several awards at the Tokyo International Anime Fair, Animage Anime Grand Prix, and Animation Kobe event. Critics have also praised the series for its large audience appeal as well as the cross conflicts shown among the main characters and the moral questions presented. [Source: Wikipedia]\nFirst of all I would like to talk about an interesting point.\nIn fact, \"Lelouch of the Rebellion\" is often compared with the same seems to be one of my favorite movies - \"Death Note\" comparisons. I think it is not without reason, after all, in fact, the two characters \"Yagami\" and \"Lelouch\" is very similar, as are the two animated with \"battle of wits\" as the starting point, the two critics also have a lot of diffuse rivalry, and two also had a lot of support with a child. From the role of point of view, the two men have a lot in common:\nFirst, the two main characters are animated, on the character, setting the background are very similar, these two are the main characters subvert the previous animation settings, they are bad, Lelouch's goal is to establish peace in the capitalist countries, in order to achieve their goals unscrupulous murder . Yagami, too, he believes is right on reservations, the wicked damn, only he who agree to live in his \"New World.\" On the terms of the ability, Geass and Death Note are very powerful weapons, but both are nothing but requires careful planning to avoid the weaknesses above it.\nBoth rely on their own special ability to manipulate the lives of the overall situation of life and death, and both the bigger picture are strong, and it will manipulate the people, and they are for the purpose by any means. Finally, they have the same in this world own \"justice\" of the Incarnation, man worshiped, admired the, is the so-called \"Zero\" and \"KIRA.\"\nBut then, although both are good works. But in fact, compared with the \"Death Note\", I would not say Lelouch of the Rebellion Drama \"climax and downs\" or \"echoed around\" kind of thing. In fact the story of this animation is really quite simple, even a little boring, the whole animation I do not see where is the climax point.\nIn terms of results, Lelouch of the Rebellion is not dead good pen. Beginning of the story, Lelouch met the \"CC\", and by this opportunity to gain the ability called \"Geass\" in. However, this capability will let Lelouch with his \"With his intended\" control of any person, in other words, in addition to not have to look at twice Geass and others in the eyes of these two rules the same person, Geass is almost no \" limited. But in comparison, the death pen but has a lot of rules and restrictions on its use, on the results, the death pen a lot of layout, plot and story, almost all generated around these rules, which also includes Yagami month in accordance with the rules of the launch of the change, so bland \"Death Note Rules\" has many rich unfold. Based on this setting, Geass too strong, since the writers came up with Geass kind of thing, and also want to try to use this to push the story, there is no good to put such a plan is set to take is to make me feel very unfortunate place .\nIn addition, \"Lelouch of the Rebellion\" in fact is also often used with \"Guilty Crown\" Comparing the simple reason that, just as the death pen, both very similar animation. But here I really do not want to be compared to the two together, because there is no better than (LOL). \"Guilty Crown\" I will not go into details here, summed it an idiom to express my feelings: \"baffling.\" (My other friends are interested fill Review)\nOn the story, although I said the film almost no climax, but I also did not negate this animation, conversely, Lelouch of the Rebellion of the story is not the best, but \"almost\" all above average In many ways the performance is \"almost,\" because \"Lelouch of the Rebellion\" come and deal with it the story of a new way, which is called \"the old stems new use\" has enough twists and turns, at least not feel boring . I think here I have to mention his character, and in the \"Lelouch of the Rebellion\" character set, this movie's performance and the best shape I've ever seen.\n\"Lelouch of the Rebellion\" character as much as 50 several, Wikipedia and even open up a website on the character Lelouch of the Rebellion. I have just cited several: CC, Ohgi, Kallen, Euphemia, Cornelia, Lloyd, Cecile, even Guilford, there Suzaku, Shirley, Milly and the like. Although the character so much, but it is every character is shaping well, these many as 50 can simultaneously manage several people at the same time, and control was so good, the writer's skill makes me very amazing. Successful people, but also to dull the story becomes more compact complex role roles, each person has their own story and played the way, and was given the soul, just right staged a good-looking animation.\nIn addition, writers are very good at what point in time the appetite of the audience hanging on, and when the story reservation up, and throw in unexpected places, these storytelling skills, mastery of screenwriter very appropriate, draw the line very well. Again, screenwriter very good use of main and side switch complement the main, branch of the well, in addition to leave room to create a sense of mystery, but also against the background of a good story line, go step by step to promote the development of the story, and even can master, the combined branch in this area with the \"doll game\" has the same purpose.\nEchoed around the plot gimmick, though small, but quite reasonable convergence, foreshadowing also buried well, this contributed to the skill of the writer to throw things, and almost every hint is retained, there is very clear back, only pity the It is that, Lelouch Geass order to test the durability and for the girl to be tested, in the end does not seem to hint to complete this form back.\nBut remember what I said, the story just \"almost\" above average it?\nIn fact, the way I was quite unhappy end of R1, and let me slowly come. Yes, Lelouch of the Rebellion of coherence is very strong, but \"unexpected\" and \"outcome\" is perhaps the major flaw R1. Because fluency grasp the story well, but because of this, you did not stay a little buffer time to the audience a rest, or think about the next thing should happen, and now the forces and situations. You know, \"Lelouch of the Rebellion\" is from an entirely fictional world of overhead, let the audience keep up with these settings, the time must be used to fill the ── even be dragging its feet.\nI think the outcome is totally inexplicable, some people might say: \"This is to allow viewers to imagine space!\" No, no, the first point, I knew there were such a manner end, Jin Yong's novel \"Fox Volant of the Snowy Mountain \"had been used. But the problem is that you \"Lelouch of the Rebellion\" in architecture so much a story, launched after such a long, ending it should give a good account of the audience, speaking bluntly point, if to do so, in fact, in front of the thing completely worthless. Lelouch again ending motivation to save Nunnally, I think is completely inadequate, and I know the writers have in the shop front stems, I have to see. But the writers finally brewing and throws things or too little, do not know the number is not enough only to set the story no way finished up or what, which is what I said, \"unexpected\", so that finally made me feel, Lelouch's IQ is not being writers to the next repair or Zende?\nAgain, you say \"Fox Volant of the Snowy Mountain\" Jin Yong full complement whatever the outcome of the story is over, finally ending the suspense left to the reader, but here the writers did not finish the story is completely cut off, for example: The last bomb it? Lloyd Milei with it? Kallen's response? Nunnally it? Take her prisoner who is? Yuffie then? Keneiliya it? Jeremiah do? (I know these are in R2 mending, I have read, are now talking about R1) but everything and all the problems will only make me think the writers just want to hastily end of the story, such an outcome can not be called simply \"suspense \", but also did not hang audience appetite, you XX did not finish the story! Wikipedia also has written above, R2 is separated by only a year out before the Second Season, is obliged to put most of the story is substantially finished up, will have a so-called mystery.\nIf at that time, I will call the official story please fill until they have finished the first R2, not everyone like me, like turn before the old movie look.\nAs for my thoughts on the R2, almost similar with R1. Distinctive characters, but the story does not unfold R1 so strong, I feel a lot more in the middle are not so necessary things, paradoxically, on the story twists and turns, but wins the R2 R1. Look carefully, in fact, the story did not have a beginning, but as the story the way a writer would have time to start, turn around to find that the story had been made up such a large segment? If it is a good story, is not the kind of feeling.\nThe story continued with Lelouch struggle against the \"Holy Britannian Empire\" is. And there are more characters on stage, including new friends, enemies and so on. When this series of alliances and characters evolving, just like I am talking about the head, the story is more compact and complex. Plot twists and turns of the Second Season better, sometimes even more people feel too much better than the R1 (note to see online reviews, \"two\" almost larger than \"a\")\nUnfortunately, the last or \"outcome\" drag Lelouch of the Rebellion. It will eventually be left behind. Later in the story, I do not know where the writer wrote, finally reached the tipping point or Zende? The story began to show fatigue rhythm, but because I wanted to hurry back to close foreshadowing, but hurry, too many throw things. Drama were too short, and people think this is the climax of a place, but do not feel any emotional climax.\nEnding aspect, Lelouch's personality more and more like \"Jormungand\" in Koko, ending the whole animation style, it feels more and more like \"Jormungand\" \"anti-war\" would like to express, in this regard I do not mean moral Good, but these seem to have begun to slowly deviated from the original intention of this movie. Thus, the writer seems to be only good at describing \"When the war is conducted formula\", but not good \"when the war become past tense.\"\nIn conclusion, in fact, after reading R1, I \"Lelouch of the Rebellion\" evaluation, although not to the poor, but it is not always feel something is missing. Wonderful story, but too linear, no climax, Characteristic wonderful, the story is good, but before and after, but also to talk about the wonderful echo too. But in the Second Season I was completely transformed. Not only is the Characteristic maintain its superb, the story is also the story of the R1 perfectly padded, and also so that the entire drama before and after the echo. \"Originally Zero, Zero finally.\" Lelouch own hit The Black Knights, eventually he became their enemy, and finally even the original purpose, the behavior has changed. And Suzaku, this is a friend, but it became the most powerful enemy, but disguised as a Zero, brought peace to the world. The fate of the two men and ideas so that they staggered unrest. This is one of the process, I am looking at the time, was quite emotion. Screenwriter also buried with drama drama before the end of a thing, is Lelouch remark: \"Can shoot, only has consciousness slain.\"\nIf you want to Lelouch of the Rebellion Season two separate talk, I would say, R1 is not ugly, but it is also nice not to go, 8 points. But Second Season, but it is a rare work, I will give 9 points.\nR2, the outcome is very well designed, I believe in the outcome of R1 disappointed people will get comfort from the Second Season.\n        "},

Its look like, a bit of Transformers. Because there is robots with in Code Geass, but the diffrends is that there are people inside the robots in Code Geass, not in Transformers. It is only a robot with a artificial intelligence. The story is about a war. There are war between Great Britain and Japan.\n          \n        The Great Britain has take over Japan and called it for Area 11 and every japanese is a 11. But when there is a war there are also terrorize. Two terrorize has stolen poisen gas and drive is away in a truck.

Under the city, the poisen gas become releas, BUT, but but, it was NOT poisne gas as thought, but a girl. Lelouch escape with the girl, but capture by the police. They wuold shoot him, but the girl jump in front at him and the cartridge hit the girl. She die and Lelouch are alone again, no way to escape. But the girl take his arm and tell him about a power there can control other peoples mind. And then the story of the black nights begein, Lelouch make a nikename called Zero there will fight against the Great Britain.\nART\nUhh!!

There is also many buildings there are destroyt or in a fin condition. I really like it XD\nSOUND\nWell, when I see a movie, I dont listen to much to the music, but when I do, I think it is great it is really good and its help to do the stage more exicting. The openings are great to, its a new kind of op for me, I have never listen to that genre...!.. O.ô - ;D\nCHARACTER\nAs I say before, the character are really cool, the have so nice personality everyone of them ;D\nLelouch is the mysterious one in this anime and it is him with the eye, there can controls mind.

When his not are Lelouch, he is Zero the one there are fighting agains Geat Britain and trying to reales Japan from Great Britain. It is a hard fight, but he got strong army to use.

Now let me warn you, I have not watched Gundam, or Death Note, so I'm not here to compare different anime.\nI'll start in order. First off the story. I didn't detect, any problems with the way the plot was moving. Of course, this anime is dramatic, and most of the things occuring in the anime will probably never appear in real life, but hey, that didn't get in the way of me enjoying\n          \n        the anime.  \nKami (ha!) was not kind to Lelouch, and the rest of the characters in in anime, and I have purposely skipped over painful scenes many times during the process of rewatching. But watching Lelouch rise up from all of the pain and hurt inflicted on him was a sight to behold!\nNo matter how many times i watch code geass I never seem to get tired of lloyd's insanity, C.C's stonedness (yea...), And last but not least, Lelouch's genius, and addicting dramatic entries, and poses.\nUnlike a few people out there, animation and quality really matter to me, so that usually restrains me from watching any anime that stems from a date before 2008. But Code Geass will always live in my heart as one of the better anime, even when the animations are from... surprisingly 2005. I believe that one of the reasons why this anime succeeded as a mecha, was because they didn't focus on the Knightmare all that much unless they were moving. All of the work was directed towards the characters' eyes, and I have noticed that the unique and sharp design of the eyes, really affected the level of my enjoyment. Yes, somehow a lot of emotion leaks from them.\nI enjoyed the voice actors very much ( expecially Yukana-san \n        "},

Or not. \nBy no means is this series perfect; at some points, Code Geass is predictable and cliche, but it makes up it's [few] flaws with everything else. It is definitely cliche and typical, but it's definitely worth the watch. \nThe animation is great. It's definitely not perfect, but adds to the story and gets better with each episode. The mecha battles are especially great, although it occasionally falters. Overall, animation and art is better than most out there. \nCharacter designs by CLAMP are great, but have the usual CLAMP style; elongated legs, arms, etc.\nVoice acting (Jun Fukuyama and\n          \n        Yukana escpecially) is great; it adds a sense of depth. The voice actors are superb; each adds life into the series. However, there are certain ones that falter when light shines onto their characters.\nThe music isn't terrible, but it isn't the best. Some openings are god-awful, while others are possibly the best out there. It does compliment the scenes, tho.\nSome characters are completely cookie-cutter. CG is filled with fanservice, mechas, and possibly every sort of genre out there. However, as the series continues (also into the sequel, R2), the characters develop multiple aspects and depth. Characters seemingly shallow and predictable become more interesting and break out of the mold.\nEnjoyment varies from person to person, especially because of the \"Code Geass vs. Death Note\" argument out there. I won't deny it doesn't have similarities, but it's not the same as Death Note. If you liked Death Note, you will most likely like Code Geass. It has plot twists, fights for \"justice\", and mecha fights. \nAgain, this series is far from perfect, but it's plot twists, characters, and overall theme left me with a sense of enjoyment when I finished watching it.\nDefinitely worth the watch!\n        "},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=3, ["text"]="                          \n    First of all, I would like to mention that this will serve as my review of both Code Geass R1 and R2. I decided to review the whole series as a whole instead of the seasons separately and my scores are based on considering both seasons. The best way to introduce Code Geass is simply to call it Death Note with mechs (though not literally). You can clearly see that Code Geass  is one of the most recommended anime for Death Note fans and visa-versa. Code Geass has all the intelligence, well craft plans and strategies shown in Death Note, but applied to a\n          \n        military formula.\nStory: 9\nLet’s get the negatives out of the way.. My complaints on the story are largely based on fillers like the infamous cat episode. Don’t bother watching the fillers because they really kill the mood of the anime and aren’t even slightly funny. There is also a significant amount of fanservice during these episodes (and sometimes even in the main episodes) that distracts from full immersion but it’s not too excessive that the anime because a “high school of the dead with mechs” anime. In the end, I did not find that these issues detract from how good the story really is.\nWhen a Code Geass episode is not a pointless filler and following the main story, it’s simply awesome The world is well crafted and possibly inspired by George Orwell’s 1984, but in a future setting. Lelouch Lamperouge is an exiled prince of the Holy Brittanian Empire that vows revenge against the emperor and creates an insurgent organization known as the Black Knights whose goal is to destroy the Empire.  He does this with the help of Geass, a power that lets him control people completely. The story is very interesting to watch as Lelouch dismantles the empire on battle at a time and grows a strong reputation in Japan (area 11). The tension in this show can only matched by Death Notea’s as the viewer sees Lelouch’s plans unravel. The story has excellent build up, despite the fact that the first episode was a bit too fast paced and the anime struggles to easy the viewer into the world. However, once you’ve been sucked in it’ll be hard for you to escape the magic :D\nThe Art and Animation: 9\nMy major complaint with the art is the character design. At first they looked like stretched pieces of spaghetti to me, but I got used to it quickly enough. In the end, the art and animation are superb. The environments are beautiful and there is clear attention to detail, the mechs look great, the animations are smooth and precise, etc. Basically, all the things you expect from a very well animated anime will be present here. It should not disappoint.\nSound: 8\nSoundtrack is awesome and played well. I didn’t like most of the opening themes after the intial one and hated all the ending themes. However, I will still give it an 8 due to the fact that the soundtrack within the anime (outside of OPs/ED) are fantastic and the voice acting is great in both the sub and the dub. Furthermore, all the sound effects sound as expected and I did not kill immersion.\n\nCharacters: 8\nLelouche is easily the best character in this show. All the other characters are interesting, but some are downright annoying. I deeply hated Suzaku’s idiotic view of the world and his hypocrisy sickened me. Nina was also extremely annoying so thank god she didn’t get too much screen time.  The student council members are sometimes annoying and sometimes great depending on the episode. I would rank them as below average slice of life characters. Well, that basically sums up all the “meh” or poor characters in this show. The rest are fantastic and trust me, there are a TON of fantastic characters in this show.\nEnjoyment: 9\nThe fillers sometimes ruined the experience, but I would consider Code Geass as one of the most entertaining anime’s I have ever seen. Its main story is exciting with an excellent protagonist; it has a cool setting, awesome mecha action and finally, some of the best tension and suspense in anime. If there is one thing Code Geass can do, it’s entertain an audience.\n Overall: 9\n+ excellent story\n+ cool and well developed setting\n+ Excellent protagonist and mostly great supporting characters\n+ some of the best tension and suspense in anime\n+ Awesome soundtrack\n-- Fillers\n-- Fan service\n-- Some bad and annoying characters"},

			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I'm going to start off by laying my cards on the table and admitting that this anime is one of my favourite anime's of all time ( I can certainly say that this is in my top 5). Rarely do we get such intense fantasy thrillers in anime that are so good and so enjoyable to watch as Code Geass the only other anime I can rank highly in comparison would be Death Note. Code Geass is a turbo charged rollercoaster ride with aerial explosions and missiles going off all about, set in an artificially created world around a star that is going nova. It\n          \n        is super good theatre. Mega dramatic, with exaggerated theatrics, but it works. In terms of attaching human emotion and experience with the characters and plot, it is top notch.\nThe story start with the main character and amidst political and slice of life school, far reaching conceptual analysis of free will vs predetermined fate, including permanent peace and utopia, are among the 50 episodes constituting the series. Even though each episode is around 24 minutes, which includes the Opening and End runs, so many sequences happen at once that you feel like you just saw an hour long feature film. The amount of plot complexity and exciting happenings makes it feel that way.\nThe artwork in terms of character design was stunning it really compliments this anime story very well and has something which I think every type of anime fan will enjoy (and some fan service too). The artwork is amazingly beautiful especially when it comes to the mecha designs (and if you weren't a fan of mecha anime before you will be after this). The anorexic design famous by CLAMP is not taken to quite as much extremes here, especially with the varied costumes and MECHA combat. It does lend a remarkable air of fragility to feminine characters, not to mention highlighting youth and adolescence.\nThe pace of events and plot advancement is quite rapid creating high tense interest and cliffhangers at the end of almost every episode. The introduction of comedic episodes fits quite well into the emotional connections required to make sense of the main character's relationships. This is not like Scrapped Princess, however, where the humour is spread well over the series. Unlike Scrapped Princess, Code Geass has no problems figuring out the balance between humour and love of life with death's sadness and despair.\nThere is a fair bit of tragedy here, especially of the Greek and Shakespearian kind. On the other hand, there are noble deaths. Beautiful deaths that are sublime in aesthetic and heart wrenching in sadness. A death that brings forth new life is simply one end and the beginning of another. In Christian and Buddhist and ancestor worship zones, death is simply the gateway to a different existence rather than the end of existence, as atheists believe in.\nI love the conflict between free will and predetermined fate. Should people be allowed to decide what dreams to pursue and their methods, or should a centralized authority or special group of elite and enlightened leaders decide for the people. Does a permanent peace become an eternal good that ethically justifies any evil, of whatever duration or magnitude, so long as the evil is temporary compared to the eternal length of the ultimate goal? Should the security of a people, a state, a country, or even a continent be ensured by centralized forces, chains of command, and military forces or should they be secured by the individuals at the bottom of the society, which a lack of security affects the most.\nI recommend you go see this anime right away. My overall thought is this is one of the best anime you will ever see in terms of story, characters and action. GO SEE THIS ANIME RIGHT NOW!\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3, ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Code Geass is my favorite anime of all time, no discussion on why is to be made. It's genius, the pure story of how Britannia became the biggest country and super power in the world and the brit's prince and princess were sent to Japan during the war on an exile is amazing. Lelouch got to meet a friend called Suzaku and he helped him survive when they were young until one day they were split up, and on that day Lelouch swore to destroy Britannia to Suzaku. It's interesting to see later on how Britannia's exiled prince is fighting with Japanese against his own\n          \n        nation under the mask of Zero while Suzaku is hiding in the Lancelot, a next generation Knightmare (this anime has mechas and they're awesome, they don't really make the anime so it's ok if you don't like Mecha, you'll still like it :) ). Not only that, Japan later on loses the war and becomes Area 11, in which Lelouch vi Britannia and his crippled, blind little sister live in. This all happens before the anime begins so it's not spoils. This however kinda is (1st ep ending included) - So Lelouch's hobby is skipping school to go play chess against nobility and considered to be of great intelligence people. He often bets money on these gambles and he says how long it'd take him to beat his opponent, which by the way is a crucial psychology break, if you just announce your victory in that much time and you pull it off.  Anyway, Lelouch completely destroys this guy after which however, on his way back to school, he gets involved into a terrorist run-away operation with a supposed \"bio-weapon\" of mass destruction. Surviving the catastrophe and accidentally opening the Bio-weapon container, he has been compromised by Britannia's military forces, which claim him to be a terrorist as well, true, I'd say that too but his friend Suzaku Kurugi (childhood friend btw) saves him by denying orders, getting shot in the process. Lelouch and the mysterious green-haired girl run away but he is once again found out and before his moment of execution, C.C. (or C2 as she calls herself) jumps in front of the bullet shot at Lelouch to save him. Thinking that she is dead, the military captain prepares to shoot Lelouch and say it was him who killed her in an act of terrorism. Before her \"death\" however, she touches his hand and offers him the \"Power of the Kings\" known as Geass. With that power he will be able to live on but his life, name, friends and future as a whole will be all a lie. In  return for her power, he will repay her one day in a method she doesn't say until Season 2 (Episode 15). Lelouch, being in a tough spot accepts the power of Geass (which manifests in people's eyes) and he's come to this sort of \"threat\" where he asks the military : Why aren't they shooting him if he's so weak, powerless and a bird-like symbol appears in his left eye. That is his Geass, the power to execute commands, which will be obeyed and until they're done, the person who's being Geass-ed would lose his memories before and during the process. Lelouch gives his final philosophy on \"power\" as he says \"The only ones who should kill are those, prepared to be killed\" after which he commands them to all die, which they can't refuse after they made eye contact and shoot themselves in the head. After this whole scene of losing himself, Lelouch thinks on his life, saying it truly has become a lie and that this is not him.. \"yet\". He gives an evil grin as the screen turns black and Episode 2 follows as he is using the terrorists as \"pawns\" for his and their escape from Shinjuku Ghetto. You get the point, he's a badass and I dare say he equals, if not beats Light/Kira from Death Note as he is more  strategical, thinking not only about himself and his identity's safety but also how to use his \"people\" to survive and fight off Britannia to avenge his Mother's death and his sister's current condition. \nCharacter Design : 9/10 ( Rivalz and Nina shouldn't be so dull or overjoyed, other than that I think everything's alright)\nMusic : 9/10   Great OST, the bgm really makes you feel like you're following a royalty while the protagonist is no longer one, even in times of big battles, the OST fits awesome but it could use a bit more variety \nPlot : 10/10 ... no comment, just watch it and you'll see why\nAnime adaptation : 8/10   Okay, R2 shouldn't exist according to the Manga but it became so popular that they decided to make an R2 to explain what happened after the \"show off\" between the main protagonists. Still, I think they put a lot of effort into R2 and it's a really great adaptation, even with lack of Manga unlike Guilty Crown, I personally wanted to see more from it but just 2 chapters to make an awesome animation,music and character design go to waste by plot holes is breaking. Code Geass suffers from no such things .. maybe once when Nina constructed a super weapon (eh?)\nVoice Acting : Now some of you may disagree with this but it's my opinion, my review of it \nJap : 9/10   | Eng : 10/10 \nWhen I watched CG for the first time, it was still airing, I was new to anime and reading subtitles wasn't really my thing. I was happy though, I liked it a lot but seriously, Johnny Yong Bosch deserves not only a piece of the cake, not the cake as a whole but at least 10 cakes for his dramatic, over-the-top performance on Lelouch's role, he is a master at voice acting and it has been proven as this anime is probably the best Eng-dubbed anime ever with top-notch voice actors on both ends but in the Japanese dub, I didn't feel like Lelouch sounded AS badass as he did in the English so yeah... flame me, it's my opinion :)\nOverall : I'd say this anime deserves a 10/10 if it wasn't for some things such as Suzaku's crazy-ass hair.. was that supposed to distinguish him as a Japanese ?  But my score for this, if I could give it a score, would be 10/10, ignoring those little things that make me want to strangle Rivalz and Nina\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3, ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I started watching Code Geass because I had heard it was similar to Death Note. A common comparison, but not wholly accurate. Where Death Note entertained me, Code Geass blew me away. Code Geass is not perfect. The fanservice is annoying. The plot can be rushed. It can border on ridiculous. But those flaws pale in comparison to the quality of storytelling and the extraordinary character development which beat Fullmetal Alchemist for the title of my favorite anime.\nCode Geass is about rebellion. It's about war, hatred, oppression, love, friendship, and choice. It's about discerning what is right and what is wrong; it's about loss and\n          \n        how far people will go to recover what they love. Code Geass is about seeing a broken world through the eyes of all types of people, about never knowing who is right, about empathizing with each character. It is entertaining, yes, but it is also thought-provoking. And that is what makes it my favorite anime. On to the specifics:\nStory 9/10\nNot the most original premise, but not horribly cliched either. An exiled prince of the Brittanian Empire attempts to liberate Japan to create a peaceful world for his sister. There are so many twists and turns on this journey that, upon rewatching the show, I was sometimes surprised a second time. The plot twists and cliffhangers can border on ridiculous at times, but the exaggerated plot, for me, is saved by the incredible intentionality of the story and the level of foreshadowing early in the show which makes the twists more believable and creates a wonderful build-up to the end of the first season. Rewatching the show, I was catching bits of foreshadowing for events that don't happen until the second season. The plot requires some suspension of disbelief, but, if you're able to do that, it's one amazing ride.\nArt 10/10\nI'm not terribly picky about art. While it wasn't as gorgeous as Angel Beats! or Legend of the Legendary Heroes, there were some spectacular shots, and the art was sufficient to tell the story well. Nothing to gawk at, but it isn't distracting once you get used to it. Even more than the art itself, I appreciated the way it was directed. The snapshots of the large cast, the way it could tell a story without words, in just a few seconds.\nSound 10/10\nI love the music to Code Geass. The music blended in most of the time, but, when it needed to shine and take over the mood, boy, it did. The use of \"Stories\" especially impressed me.\nCharacter 10/10\nThe characters are what really made Code Geass for me. Having a good plot is important, but, without good characters, the ship will go down. Code Geass has an incredibly large cast, and I am thrilled to say that by the end of its two seasons, I knew every single one of their names. No, not every character is explored to his or her full potential, but very few characters are flat, and I was attached to almost all of them by the end. Lelouch and Suzaku are incredible foils for each other, and I love them as main characters. CC and Euphemia at first seem one-dimensional, but they grow deep and interesting over time. Characters I hated at the beginning of the show, I had grown to love by the end. Almost every character has a story, a reason for doing what they do. The characters are what made this show shine.\nOverall 10/10\nCode Geass is not for everyone. It requires some suspension of disbelief. It certainly has its flaws. But, all in all, it is absolutely brilliant. The characters are engaging. The plot is interesting. The art and music are lovely. It is a story that still sticks with me, and I enjoyed it even more the second time through. Definitely the highlight of all the anime I have watched to date.  Highly recommended.\n        "},

			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    To be honest, when my siblings showed me the first episode, I didn't know what to expect. But, with this anime, or you love it or you hate it. You can't be in between. I was one of those people who loved it. Why? Because it's not your sweet innocent anime that you watch before going to bed. It's about a guy who has a heart of stone and doesn't mind if he kills a couple people. Although there is one thing that surprised me: it passed from P.G-13 to R+. Why R+?\nBut That's besides the point: this anime was awesome.\nStory (10): Lots of people\n          \n        said that there were plot holes but I didn't notice. All along, the story was original and unexpected. The Nightmare development through out the story is amazing and all the friends & best friends trying to kill each other make the story super entertaining. \nArt (9): Art in this anime is awesome. The fingers of Lelouch are plain epic and he has some crazy face expressions, like real crazy. The nightmares are nicely designed and the graphics are super cool. The explosions/magicnightmarebeam are nicely designed. The reason why I didn't give the art a 10 is because the women have a *problem* with their chest and this *problem* made their chest slightly too big.\nSound (8): Not much to say about the sound since I mostly watch and don't listen to the music. C2 and Kallen's voices are nice to listen to and Lelouch's evil mastermind laughter definitely gives the sound at least 6 points.\nCharacters (10): Ahhhhhh...... the interesting part, the reason why I love this anime soooooo much. Lelouch, your typical highschool student, is actually a britanian prince. He has a supernatural power named Geass and has genius level intellect. He has a heart of stone and doesn't mind killing a couple people to get what he wants. Don't get me wrong: he has feelings, but there just isn't any space for love in heart, only space for revenge. Lelouch is also the kind of guy that every girl falls for, and two of those girls pay for it. Let's just say that Lelouch never did a singe thing halfway and made Code Geass the best anime ever.\nLloyd and Rakshata are your mad scientists, having their little scientist war while the whole world is fighting.\n\nEnjoyment (10): I could have done nothing but watch this anime 7 days strait. That's how good it is. I highly recommend this series (R1 and R2). This rewiew is for R1 and R2.\nI hope you enjoyed my review! :-)\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Code Geass has been my favorite anime for a very long time, even though I wasn't sure if I'd like it at all when I started watching it. The first episode I'd seen was the cat chase episode, so you can imagine my disbelief when I watched the first few episodes afterwards.\nSTORY: The plot of Code Geass is so well thought out that I wouldn't dream of giving it anything but a ten. It keeps you on your toes and guessing, but it doesn't get tiring like it can with some other anime. Every plot twist makes sense and, to be honest, makes you feel\n          \n        kind of dumb at some points. It definitely had me saying \"why didn't I see that coming????\" plenty. \nThe storyline will also -- if you're a crybaby like myself -- make you cry at certain parts. It's very emotional, but does not focus on one thing for too long, making it appeal to different audiences. It will keep you entertained if you like figuring things out and thinking about what you're watching, but it will also be enjoyable if you like to just mindlessly marathon shows as well.\nIn any case, the story had me impressed from start to finish, which is why I gave a ten.\nART: The art is beautiful, and I think this is more personal opinion then anything else as to why I only gave it an eight. CLAMP was the designer for the series, and don't get me wrong -- I love CLAMP, but sometimes the proportions will weird me out a little. I guess it's up to personal preference.\nOther then that, the world art is gorgeous. The mechas are gorgeous. Buildings, scenery, everything is beautifully drawn with the perfect amount of detail. I find it very easy to get wrapped into the world that Code Geass creates because of this.\nSOUND: I have seen both the sub and the dub, and I do prefer the sub, but both are well done. I usually find dubbed anime to be unbearable to watch, especially if I've seen the original, but the dub voice actors put a great amount of emotion into their roles and I think did a pretty decent job.\nIn the original, I have no complaints.\nOther then that, the soundtrack is beautiful and haunting at times and I fell in love with it during my first watch of the show, back in like 2008. \nCHARACTER: I gave a ten because every character is so well thought out and so different from each other. The character development is fantastic and gorgeous to watch (as well as heart shattering at times). Each character gets focused on, at least somewhat, and you really get inside the head of Lelouch in a way that you don't really see with a lot of shows these days, I feel.\nThe designs were all fantastic and I love them to bits and pieces. I have no complaints and I don't think I ever will.\nI tend to go through phases with some of the characters, whether I love them or hate them, and I think that shows how great the character development is. For instance, I hated Suzaku for a very long time, and everything he stood for. But over time I understood him more and more, and the more I watched the more I found myself sympathizing with him. Now, I still go through phases -- I either hate his guts or I love him to bits and pieces. To me, that shows that they made the characters all very HUMAN. They gave them emotions, a goal to strive for. Secrets and quirks and they made them realistic. That, to me, deserves a ten.\nENJOYMENT: Code Geass is one of those shows I can watch over and over again and not get tired of it. I could have every plot twist memorized, know exactly how the series was going to go, and still find myself getting emotional and enjoying the rewatch.\nI've probably seen the entirety of the series ten or eleven times now, but I still find myself recommending it to people and offering to watch it with them, even though I know exactly what's going to happen. It does not lose it's rewatch value, I think it gains it. It allows you to think \"oh, how did I miss that the first time? Of course that's what would happen\" and things like that, which for me is highly enjoyable.\nIn any case, no matter what watch you're doing, first, second, tenth, you will enjoy Code Geass.\nOVERALL: I'm giving Code Geass a ten for overall. Over the years it has remained my favorite anime and will continue to do so for a long time, I think. I'm so glad I decided to watch this show all the way through and give it a chance. It's so beautiful and emotional and fun to watch and think about.\nEverything about this show appeals to me. You've got your mechas, your romance, your fight scenes, good character development. It makes you think, on top of all that. I think any could enjoy this show as much as I do, it doesn't matter who you are or what you like. This is an anime I would gladly recommend to anyone.\n        "},
			{["score"]=5, ["helpful"]=3, ["text"]="\n                          \n    SPOILER WARNING\nI've heard and read nothing but good things about Code Geass, so when I started the series, I liked it because, quite frankly, I expected that I was going to like it. For a time, if you asked me if I was enjoying it, I would have answered \"yes\", simply because the premise is interesting, the dialogue is fairly well written, and the art style is unique.\nLelouch Vi Brittania starts off normal and goes insane with power - the power of Geass, to be precise. Don't ask me what Geass is, I can't define it and I'm already watching the second season (I'll clarify,\n          \n        this is out of obligation. I am driven to the brink of madness myself by not completing what I start, even if it is crap). It's magical stuff, that's all you've gotta know. Anyway, his descent into badness is reminiscent of Light Yagami from Death Note, which will obviously compel any anime fan out there. If you're feeling like that alone makes this show worth checking out, I implore you, hear my words.  \nAll the major problems this show has can be pinned down to that stupid Geass, which is especially problematic as that is the titular subject. If you take it at face value and resist any ability to reason or consider logic that your brain may possess, this show will seems flawless.\nSo, what exactly is the problem with the Geass? How could I find any conceivable botheration with such a critically acclaimed masterpiece??!!\nWell my friends, it all begins with the fact that Lelouch's damned Geass only works on a person once. But that one time, oho, he can make that person do anything he wants. This is the only reason the plot thickens in the show, because the tactical genius that is Lelouch Vi Britannia is too stupid to think up a good command.\nThis series suffers from time turner syndrome. All Lelouch needs to do is say, \"You will do everything I say at all times forever, without question,\" and EVERY SINGLE CONFLICT in the show is nixed! Our protagonist would suddenly have the ability to repeatedly order around all the people he's come in contact with. Oh, you saw me kill a guy? GEASS - remember you've always got to obey!- now you've forgotten it. Oops, I told Euphemia to kill all Japanese. GEASS stop it Euphie.\nWhy bother infiltrating the ministry when you can travel in time 60 years past and kill the evilest person to every live? Shh don't question it, it's so intense.\nBut noooo, instead of being rational, our dear Lelouch gives orders such as, \"Draw chalk on the wall forever,\" and my personal favourite, the menacing, \"Give me your knightmare,\" REallY LELOUCH? You have one chance to control this guy. You're in a position where it's 2 to 1 in your favour. Shoot the guy in the leg and hijack his Knightmare. What if he ends up becoming the Emperor of Britannia, and you can't control him because you already wasted your fucking geass on him? Pfft forget all that. Order this guy to get me a kit kat while you're at it.\nThe problem with even the end all command, is that the all powerful infallible crazy god talent that is the Geass fails all the fucking time. Nearly everyone who is affected by Lelouch's power ends up fighting against it or figuring out Lelouch's identity anyway.\nYou want to know the sad part? I JUST thought about this! I went through 28 episodes of this crap before I figured out what exactly was bothering me. How could you possibly neglect to notice plot holes this huge? Every time anything happens now, the only think I can think is, \"Easily avoided. Uggghh chess metaphor but they suck at tactics. Are you dumb? Yes, you are, since you didn't notice that thing.\"\nLike I said before, if this kind of stuff doesn't bother you, I'm sure you'll enjoy this show. Personally, I don't know if I can do this anymore. sigh\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3, ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I know there are like a million reviews for this anime, but I've decided to write one because I really want to. I watched Code Geass on a whim, not expecting to enjoy it at all, but I was intrigued after the first episode because it wasn't the typical \"protagonist is the good guy who fights for righteousness\" plot line.\nStory: 10\nThe story itself is pretty simple: an exiled prince of Britannia named Lelouch trying to help Japan gain it's freedom from Britannia. Some of the plot lines are cliche, and some of them aren't. What really makes the plot special is the execution. Despite some\n          \n        parts being cliche, Sunrise did it in such a way that made the cliche parts not so cliche anymore. The plot wasn't too fast, nor was it too slow.\nArt: 10\nWhat can I say? I love CLAMP's art. They may not be the best in executing plot lines (in my opinion, at least) but their art is beautiful. WhenI first watched Code Geass, I thought their proportions were a little off (everyone being extremely tall and thin) but regardless of anatomy rules, I think it looked quite nice. To me, it also seemed to give Code Geass a unique art style everyone would immediately be able to recognize as from Code Geass.\nCharacters: 10\nThe Code Geass characters were definitely all awesome, especially Lelouch. His charcter was very deeply and intricately developed (well he is the main character) the other characters were also pretty good. Some of them seem a bit two dimensional at first, but were eventually developed later on. Despite all this, I still feel that there was a lot more room for charcter development, like with Marianne, Charles, and many others. I think sunrise should've stretched Code Geass for one more season to add more time for charcter development. I also think that *minor spoiler here* some characters were killed of too early, like Lelouch's parents. We were shown the whole of Charles' charcter, but never actually got to feel his whole character. The characters were all excellent, but it quite disappoints me to see so much wasted potential.\nSound: 10\nThe voice actors for Code Geass were also excellent. I especially loved Lelouch and Euphemia's voice actors. Suzaku's voice actor was also quite good. The dub wasn't that bad, but the subbed version is definitely way better. The opening and closing songs were pretty good, but the only one i really loved was the first one. COLORS, by FLOW. My only negative critique for them is that they reuse animations from the previous opening songs. When the opening changed, they just scrambled the animations from the original opening and added in afew new ones. I've noticed this with Sunrise's previous works too, like Gundam. I personally think that they shouldn't change the opening if they're too lazy to make new animation for it.\nEnjoyment: 10\nI fully enjoyed Code Geass. I think it's the perfect series for anyone who likes mecha anime and enjoys a more unique type of protagonist. It's also the perfect show to watch if you love to write fanfictions. (So many unanswered questions!) I hope that maybe one day in the future, Sunrise will make another season, or better yet, a remake of Code Geass.\nSo unless you want an anime with an extremely fulfilling ending, you should definitely watch Code Geass\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    *SPOILER WARNING: This anime review may spoil minor to major details related to Code Geass R1 and R2. If you have not seen this anime and wish to get an opinion on it, please refer to my overall ranking/recommendation at the bottom of this post. Otherwise, please proceed at your own risk!*\n\nFrom the gripping and well-executed action sequences and mecha fights, to the strategic point of view and motivational back-story, Code Geass is an amazing anime series for the diehard action fan. This 2 season, 50-episode-long anime packs a riveting story with exceptionally likable characters (and voice actors) and state of the art animation, with\n          \n        very little to stand in its way of becoming an \"anime classic\". Hello again, my name is DJCOOLIOMAN44, and today I will be giving you my full review of Kodo Giasu: Hangyaku no Rurushu, better known in English as Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion.\nFor this review, I will only focus on the first season of Code Geass (dubbed by fans as R1 to coincide with the second season, R2) because there is a lot of ground to cover over the 2 seasons of 25 episodes each. There are a few differences from characters to plot developments that are not shared between R1 and R2, so it will be easier to review the 2 seasons individually. Without further ado, let's get to the review!\n\nThe Story:\nCode Geass is set in a fictional world where the Holy Britannian Empire is one of the world's last remaining superpowers, controlling about 1/3 of the world. The story follows Lelouch Vi Britannia, a young prince of the Holy Britannian Empire, who is exiled from his palace after his mother, Marianne Vi Britannia, is shot and murdered by an unknown assailant and his younger sister, Nunnally Vi Britannia, is left crippled and blinded in the crossfire. Lelouch swears for vengeance as he watches the country of Japan fall on its knees when it is taken over by his father's army and renamed Area 11. With the help of a mysterious girl named C.C. who grants him the power of Geass and a group of Japanese resistance fighters who become his allies, Lelouch sets out to destroy the nation he once called home and free the oppressed Japanese people under the name of Zero.\n\nThis anime has an amazing story that never seems to stop giving, even after multiple reruns. There are quite a few \"filler episodes\" in the first season, however in the long run, these episodes are realistic and necessary. Lelouch can't expect to battle the Holy Britannian Empire 24/7, and these episodes show the lighter and more personal side of the story, where we learn about the main and minor characters' intentions and back-stories. Although there are a few moments in season 1 where the story seems to drag on and nothing new and exciting happens, the pacing of Code Geass R1 is very consistent, with every episode leaving you begging for more. I have not watched much of the original Japanese sub of this show, but I am very impressed with what I've seen. This anime seems to be better suited for an English dub, as Britannia is technically and English-speaking nation, and the dub is absolutely incredible! Johnny Yong Bosch (also know for Bleach's Ichigo Kurosaki, Eureka Seven's Renton Thurston and Trigun's Vash the Stampede, to name a few) does an excellent job as Lelouch, along with Kate Higgins as C.C., Yuri Lowenthal as Suzaku and Karen Strassman as Kallen for the main cast.\nSummary: Amazing story that is well paced and exciting, despite some dry parts early in the series. Amazing dub that is arguably better than the original subbed version.\nStory: 29/30 points\n\nCharacters:\nIf there's one thing that's very notable about Code Geass, it's that there are a TON of characters. Off the top of my head, there are probably 30 to 40 noteworthy characters that have significance in the plot of this anime. Since this series has so many characters, there are more appealing characters in this show as well as more detestable ones. Overall, each character in Code Geass does a fantastic job in their own respective roles, ranging from the Student Council members to the Black Knights to the Britannian higher-ups. It's hard to say that any character is \"bad\" in Code Geass, however there are some characters that are not very likeable and are hated on by the Code Geass fanbase. Many of the characters are very relatable, especially characters like Lelouch and Kallen, whose back-stories are so explored that it would be impossible not to understand their motivations. As for character designs, Clamp really knocked this one out of the park! I will admit that it's hard to work around the whole \"school uniform\" thing for the student council members, but individual character designs such as Lelouch's Zero costume, C.C.'s prison suit-thingy and Suzaku and Kallen's plugsuits (Evangelion style) are very unique and creative. Many people complain about the character's torso size being disproportional to the rest of their body, but this is very easily overlookable and doesn't affect the quality of the show in any way.\nFavourite Male Character: Lelouch Vi Britannia/Zero\nHonestly, with the amount of time the series focuses on Lelouch, it's hard for him to not be the fan favourite character. Lelouch, unlike Light from Death Note (who he is constantly compared to by the anime community), seems to have a sympathetic side, and viewers can really understand Lelouch's motivations as to why he would destroy his home country. He is a well-developed dynamic character who is an absolute pleasure to watch when his carefully planned attacks succeed, and that epic Geass power adds some points on his coolness level!\nFavourite Female Character: Kallen Kozuki/Stadtfeld\nKallen is probably one of the most well-developed female characters in this anime. The viewer can really understand her dedication and loyalty to the Black Knights and Zero, despite not knowing who he is. With Kallen's story regarding her mother early on, we can see that Kallen has faced terrible struggles at the hands of Britannia, as did Lelouch, making her character more relatable and understandable. Despite the fact that many fans see Kallen as the \"fanservice character\" because of her many shower scenes in R1, she still leaves the lasting impression of ass-kicking when she pilots her custom Knightmare Frame, the Guren Mark II.\nLeast Favourite Male Character: Clovis la Britannia\nMy personal least favorite Code Geass characters don't make an appearance in R1, so I am left to pick another character that I am not overly fond of, and Clovis, 3rd prince and Lelouch's half-brother, is my least favourite male character. Being seen as the kind-hearted viceroy of Area 11, Clovis does not show his true colours as he is a snobby, womanizing jerk in reality. Clovis represents everything that Lelouch hates about Britannia (even the Imperial Family speaks poorly of him!), but thank God that his time on the show was very short-lived.\nLeast Favourite Female Character: Nina Einstein\nThis girl. Seriously. First of all, I apologize for tainting your eyes with this wretched monstrosity that is Nina Einstein. Nina is one of those characters that is so annoying that every time you see her, you just want to start complaining. Nina is absolutely obsessed with Princess Euphemia, Lelouch's half-sister, to the point where she... well... she masterbates to her picture on a table (yeah, sorry for putting that image into your heads...). She is seen as the most hated character in Code Geass because she is a very minor character in R1, only appearing to show her love for Euphemia. Her annoying personality, small relevancy and creepy demeanour put her in my least favourite character position.\nSummary: Incredible variety of characters, some lovable and some detestable, who each suit their own purpose in the show, be it minor or major. Great variety of character designs outside the school uniforms and very relatable characters make Code Geass even more incredible!\nCharacters: 24/25 points\n\nAnimation & Visuals:\nCode Geass has absolutely beautiful visuals! Since this anime was originally released in 2007 in Japan, it has access to some of the greatest and most modern animation technology. Code Geass' Knightmare Frames, which are arguably the most important animation element, move very smoothly and the characters are the same. All visual effects used in the anime, especially Lelouch's use of his Geass, are very detailed and spectacular as well. This anime looks spectacular in HD too!\nSummary: Beautiful visuals that match even 2013 animation technology (despite there being only 6 years difference). Detailed and amazing visual effects that only add on to the epicness of the series.\nAnimation & Visuals: 20/20 points\n\nMusic:\nIf you have read my Top 10 OPs post from earlier, you may recall that 3 of Code Geass' combined 5 OPs were included in the list. Since this is only based on R1, I will only review OPs and EDs from R1.\nHere are all the OPs and EDs of Code Geass R1.\nOP 1: Colors by FLOW\nOP 2: Kaidoku Funo by Jinn\nOP 3: Hitomi no Tsubasa by access\nED 1: Yuukyou Seishunka by ALI PROJECT\nED 2: Mosaic Kakera by SunSet Swish\nIn addition to these songs, there are several OSTs (original soundtracks) for the 2 seasons of Code Geass, which are absolutely incredible! The background music sets the mood of the show perfectly, ranging from the suspense of battle to the cheery Ashford Academy. As for OPs and EDs, Colors is my all-time favourite OP and Hitomi no Tsubasa places very close to it. Yuukyou Seishunka and Mosaic Kakera are very good EDs, each with very different feels to them. Finally, that leaves Kaidoku Funo. I do enjoy this song, but as an OP for Code Geass, it is my definite least favourite. I feel that the recycling of clips from OP 1 into this OP kills it, but hey, this is just my opinion!\nSummary: Music perfectly demonstrates the atmosphere of the anime, and the OPs are second to none (with one that falls a bit short in my opinion). The EDs are great but with less impact than the OPs.\nMusic: 13.5/15 points\n\nEnjoyability:\nNow it's time to for the simplest part of the review, the enjoyability factor! I say this is easy because any anime, good or bad, can easily get a perfect score here if they are interesting enough. As for Code Geass, the series contains enough action to keep an upbeat pace without overkilling it, as well as a more tactical and strategic side that will toggle the interest for people who are interested in the more complex story. The story will definitely keep the viewers intrigued and wanting more. This section doesn't even need a summary; I've pretty much just repeated myself this entire time.\nEnjoyability: 10/10 points\n\nOverall Score:\nStory: 29/30\nCharacters: 24/25\nVisuals: 20/20\nMusic: 13.5/15\nEnjoyability: 10/10\nFinal Score: 96.5/100 or 96.5%\n\nRecommendation: 10/10\nReason: Code Geass is an anime that is difficult to pass up once you've started. It manages to blend action and drama with a healthy dose of light-hearted comedy that seems nearly impossible to put down. Nearly every episode ends on some cliffhanger, be it a major or minor one, that leaves its audience craving more. Overall, it is an excellent anime experience for any action, mecha or supernatural fan!\nAs for alternate anime recommendations, I will point you towards the sequel series, Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2. This chapter in the Code Geass series features new characters, new ass-kicking mecha battles and a conclusion to the terrible cliffhanger in R1's ending.\nFor the mecha fans, I will also recommend Gainax's two most famous and, in my opinion, best animes, Neon Genesis Evangelion and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.\nFor the fans of the series' deep thinking, strategic approach and complexity, I will recommend the series that is most commonly compared to Code Geass, the ever-popular Death Note.\nThanks for checking out this review, and happy viewing!

			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Writing a review of my favourite anime of all time without being biased is going to be hard but here goes.\nDisclaimer : All of this are my personal opinion and is not intended to offend anyone by any means.\nStory : 9/10\nThe story itself is pretty basic but some of the characters' intentions are left unknown until the future episodes such as why Lelouch wanted to overthrow the Britannia Empire. But basically, the story revolves around the life of Lelouch Lamperouge or some may know him as Lelouch Vi Britannia for his real name. Like Death Note , both series have a genius protagonist that thinks\n          \n        that the current world is corrupted and needed salvation. \nOne main difference between the two masterpieces would be that Lelouch does not want to be god like Yagami Light. But rather , he just wants to overthrow the Britannia Empire , or in other words , oppose his father for abandoning him and his sister when their mother were brutally killed in front of their eyes , causing his sister , Nunally , to be blind and crippled.\nAs such , he opposes his father and attempts to overthrow the empire by becoming a terrorist. But it did not start off that well as he was just an original student with a genius intellect which some may argue to be comparable to Yagami Light. Out of pure coincidence , he got into a sticky situation where he got involved with the Japanese terrorists. Oh did I forget to mention ? The Britannia Empire had conquered most of the countries and renamed them which is the main reason why the terrorists are.. well.. committing terrorism.\nBack to where I was , he chanced upon a girl named C.C and in the face of death , the girl granted him a mysterious power called the geass. The power he was granted was the power of absolute obedience and anyone whom have direct eye contact with him would fall under his power and do his commands.\nAs such , Lelouch began to challenge the Britannia Empire with his new-found power while keeping his identity a secret , thus the alias and the mask of Zero. All for the sake of revenge and to create a world where his sister could live happily and safely without fearing for their lives.\nArt : 9/10\nTaking into account that this is a fairly old anime that originated from the 2006 , the animation quality is great with cool mechas and unique character designs. Many people would probably dislike the character design at the start but trust me , it will grow on you. There's nothing much to add on except that the animation for the mecha battles are really well done and fanservice is not abundant here. (Karen)\nSound : 8/10\nHate to say it but the soundtracks are not exactly great. There are some scenes that simply does fit with the soundtracks and it had me going ,'wtf?' most of the time. However despite that, I have to commend Jun Fukuyama for voicing Lelouch. He have done an excellent job of being his seiyuu and I definitely do not believe anyone else could have done the job better.\nOne notable scene would be where he started laughing maniacally upon finding out that the pilot piloting the dreaded Lancelot that had hindered his plans countless of times was actually his childhood friend , Suzaku.\nAs for the openings and endings , some are definitely catchy and I will give props to that , especially the first opening Colours which I thought was really well done.\nCharacter : 10/10\nLike I said before, Lelouch is often compared to Yagami Light because of their similarities. However , I believe that Lelouch is a better character than Light because of the character developments he had throughout the series instead of just having a god complex like Light. Unlike Light , Lelouch would actually stop and think about his actions and the consequences such as when he found out that he had accidentally killed one of his classmate's (whom happened to have a huge crush on him) father while fighting with the Britannia army.\nHe did not know of the consequences of his actions and that had served as a good wake up call for him after he had involved an innocent party and he almost wanted to quit the Order of Black Knights which he had formed with the Japanese terrorists because of it. He then hardened his resolve to fight Britannia once more so that he would not waste the blood that he had already spilled in what he had thought was a game of chess all along.\nThe second main character , Suzaku , was a disappointment sadly. However , he offered another perspective to the series as Lelouch wanted to change the Britannia system by overthrowing it whereas Suzaku wanted to change it from within and this led to both of them slogging it out despite not knowing of their identities until much later in the series.\nLike Lelouch , Suzaku is a complex character however , it does not justify for his hypocritical ways and don't even get me started on his insane physique. He's probably the only character except for Nina that I really wanted to kill throughout the series because their character was that hateful and I guess I can give the story writers credits for that.\nThe other characters are also developed splendidly as well other than the two main male casts. Honourable mentions would be Shirley and C.C. Sorry Kallen's fans , I find her to be slightly superficial and that her character development was barely there.\nEnjoyment : 10/10\nAs you start off the series , there are quite a lot of complex things such as Sakuradite that you would have no idea what it is about and why Lelouch would behave that way until further on the series where it's explained. As the series progresses , one would normally get excited and cheer for Lelouch despite what he's doing is morally wrong since he's committing terrorism but it's hard to not get drawn into his pace and his genius plans which he refers as real time strategy.\nEvery episode was pretty well-paced as well with enough character development to go around and considering that this is only season 1 , questions would be left unanswered as more characters would be introduced in season 2.\nThis show is capable of pulling in the audience and letting them be in the shoes of each character as emotions are depicted really well and without doubt , Lelouch is one of the most realistic characters that I have ever seen in any manga and anime because of his emotional conflicts along with the character development which I had already covered earlier. I find it hard not to sympathize and root for him , which is why this series is such a masterpiece.\n\nAnd to add on to it , there are three main romantic interests which are C.C , Shirley and Kallen. For those people whom like to see a little romance here and there , pick your ship! Thank god Lelouch isn't as dense as most main characters.\nOverall : 10/10\nI would give this series a perfect score because I feel that it deserved it for being able to engross the audience. Despite not being much of a mecha fan , I find myself wanting more and more of this series. To be exact , wanting more and more of Lelouch because the character is what lit up the flame of this show.\n\nALL HAIL LELOUCH!\n        "},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=3, ["text"]="                          \n    I had to write a review for this anime\nI really enjoyed watching Code Geass, the story line was brilliant with the use of interwoven stroy lines revolving around different characters, along with a range of story lines from romance to super powers, in my view this anime is an 'all rounder'. There are moments you love and moment you hate, but these emotions that the viewer goes through makes the viewing experience soo much better. Having watched this anime I have grown attached to the characters, seeing them develop and somehow feeling their pain. I'm happy to say the story does not end here as\n          \n        there is a season 2 which is also just as brilliant.\nHope this review helps \n        "},
			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=3, ["text"]="                          \n    Code Geass is one of those animes that you look back on and remember the emotional roller coaster that will forever change your view on mecha animes. Code Geass is quite possibly the most entertaining and amazing anime to date and here is the review. \nStory -\nWhen I started watching the first episode of Code Geass when it aired I immediately thought it was going to be another generic mecha but when I continued the episode and finished the series i ate those words. The pace of the story is quick in the beginning that really draws you in. Not in a way that gets\n          \n        you confused but a smooth and nice flow that works great with the story. You will never feel board or feel that the story is moving to slow. For Code Geass picks up the action at the right time and develops characters well. Code Geass's action is great and the visuals are well done for its time but, whats more important is the action scenes have purpose. There is reason for fight scenes, never mindless action to appeal to the audience which makes Code Geass's story shine above all other mechas. Scenes matter and they are well thought out and the action too is always justified, for there is always some larger plan or scheme going on. \n- Characters\nAnother way Code Geass shines above other mechas and other animes is the way the main character handles himself. The main protagonist is Lelouch Lambouge. He isn't the strongest character or even the best pilot for the mechs (which are called Knightmare Frames) but what he lacks in strength he more than makes up for in leadership and cunning abilities. You never feel that Lelouch is a static character but, you see him grow and change through out the series. Each time a tragic event happens it has an effect on him not for just an episode but, carries on and you really see how things that effect him change him as an individual. This gives you a feeling that he can change his way of thinking to any direction and gives the viewer a suspenseful feel about him.This doesn't only happen with the main character but several characters in fact. Code Geass has many out standing characters who do well with an already strong presence like Lelouch. You never feel like the side characters don't contribute to anything or they are there to fill the screen but, each side character have interesting plots that are fleshed out.\n- Negative \nCode Geass does at times feels like it has an identity crisis. The reason for this is the show gives humor (which there is nothing wrong with this) where the characters feel clowny and not realistic in a serious toned anime. Comedy is needed in a show to break the all serious tone of the show but, some viewers may feel that it goes over the top and at points ridiculous. At one point of the show a character is introduced (Mao) that you feel is over the top and his point is just to give the viewer some information that could have been told. This character in the show I feel really they could have done without and the show would have benefited greatly. Code Geass Also may feel sometimes like things work out to well. Some may feel that Lelouch is too smart for his own good and seems to be a genius just because the writers say he is without giving any indication on how he became a genius. \n- Conclusion \nIn conclusion Code Geass is a great anime that I feel everyone needs to watch. This anime has everything, Mechs, great battle scenes, love interests, plot twists, intelligent story, interesting characters who are well fleshed out, and amazing art and sound. Code Geass amazes me every time I re watch it and those who are on the fence I would say take the leap you wont regret it. "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3, ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    NOTE: Skip this paragraph to see the review\nI also ask you to put aside you hate for mechs just this once.\nPerfect: Make (something) completely free from faults or defects, or as close to such a condition as possible.\nNothing can be perfect, as everything has its faults, we are in fact only human after all. BUT. Something can be a masterpiece.\nMasterpiece: A work of outstanding artistry, skill, or workmanship.\nCode Geass is one such thing. Everyone argues about the \"greatest\" anime, but everyone also as their option's of it and what it should be. Although their will never be the \"greatest anime\" their can be a group\n          \n        of anime that all in their own unique way can be called Masterpieces, and its these anime like FMA Brotherhood, Clannnad, Steins; Gate, and in my opinion Code Geass as well (their are more out their but rather few to be said) that all anime strive to be called as well. This place is know as the Realm of Anime Greatness. To be in this realm an anime has to be unique in its own way, but must also have a great story, characters, and enjoyment to it. (Note: Sound and art are not in this as time takes its toll on everything) By meeting all of these means can an anime be welcomed into the Real of Anime Greatness. Now without further ado my opinion based review of Code Geass.\nThis anime holds a very special place in my heart its one of the first. no the first serious anime that required my to use my head and think about its message. \nAppeal: I first came about this anime by comments in a Lets play done by a man named HCbaily. He said in the video \"REFRAIN\", and in the comments one person asked \"is that a ref. to code geass?\" I never did find out if t was or not, but I did check it out. After the first couple of minutes is thought to my self \"These guys got way to long of limbs. I don't think I may not be able to watch this\" But I decide to keep watch, this was one of my best choices I made in a very long time and will have and forever will change me in a unique way.\nStory: I will not get into depth of this story as I do not want to spoil it for you. Its to great of a story and can not just be simplified, you need to watch it for yourself to understand why. The story as you have read the description, I hope, is about a young boy names Lelouch, and his friend Suzaku and their goal of changing the world, both have different reasons, and both have a different way of doing so. Lelouch want to destroy, while Suzaku wants to change from within. The story requires thinking about the consequences' of war, and how polluted to world has become. The story show the consequences of ones actions and in each episode we fallow not only Lelouch and his journey in destroying Britannia, but Suzaku as well. We see his reaction to what happening before him and how he goes about to achieve his goal through his own means. Every episode will leave you with thoughts on your mind and a wishing to know more, to see more into the world and what Lelouch will face next. We learn of Lelouch's morals and how different his morals and his actions are from his friend Suzaku's. So very different indeed.  \nCharacters: Many anime that have large amounts of characters seem to pay for it in terms of less character development. Code geass has alone has around 50 side characters, not including R2 of course. This is a spot were Code Geass flourishes in, its characters. Every character has a story behind them, a reason to fight, morals to go by, ever character is done out and is developed to an A. They may be introduced at the drop of a hat, but once there their they only have one way of leaving, I suggest you watch to find out how. NO character from what I know of leaves and you  question where they went and why, the plot wont say FUCK IT BECAUSE WE CAN. Every character even to the side characters are three dimensional, they act humane, they make choices based on the situation, a choice that may not always be the right one,, and will react humane based on what events just happen, and what the just chose. You will find yourself sympathizing or hating them based their actions and feeling their emotions based on their reactions. Every character has a heart, and every character you will feel a connection with. They all change, they all react, they all develop with one another, and they all have their flaws. But the flaws are not bad, their flaws lye within themselves. They all have a problem and they all face them head on. \nEnjoyment: Code Geass will have you feeling all sorts of emotions, although not everyone will feel them. The more you understand the world and its characters they more you will enjoy. The world of Code Geass has so much depth to it you can re-watch it an unlimited amount of times. The music fits the moments so well and sets the mood so good. If the music wants you to cry you cry, smile you smile, and so one and so forth. The art and animation capture the moment, a characters reactions, their despair, their happiness all of their emotions are shown, and can be seen or read just based on their face. The world is beautiful, and the characters fit it so well.\nThis is not a story with explosions and OP powerleves, everything has a reason for happening in this anime. Whether it be fighting, or a choice, everything has a reason and everything has a consequence. The plot and characters and their development are what make this anime so unique, and that is why this anime deserves indefinably to belong in the Real of Anime Greatness.\nI hope this helps, feel free to send me a message on MAL (however that works) or comment my page. If you wish to discuses things more leave a comment asking me to and ill will do so.            \n"},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3, ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Ah, Code Geass. Here is my favourite anime, one so full of incredible plot aspects and twists that I could easily blabber one for ages, and spoil every last second. To avoid this, I shall keep the plot explanation to a single sentence:\nLelouch is a student, and when his sense of honor gets him entangled with a military secret, his life is changed forever, and he will begin to embrace his destiny to free japan from the tyrannous oppression of the Holy Empire of Brittannia.\nCode Geass is exceptional. The story it tells is full of detail and the characters are always captivating and interesting, each\n          \n        with their own different motivations and methods of fighting, and no character is ever left without explanation. More than any others, Suzaku and Lelouch are an exceptional two characters, both with very strong personalities and character development. \nBut the characters and story are not the only strong aspects of this show. The art is beautiful, it embraces the Mecha aspect perfectly, yet doesn't neglect things like background design and human designs.\nBeneath the surface also lie many themes: the meaning of power, what is strength, the true meaning of authority, etc. Code Geass reveals itself, on second thought as a strong criticism of all warmongering nations, and of all absolute regimes.\nBut all work and no play makes Lelouch a dull boy, and the creators of Code Geass knew this well. You will find light-hearted intervals sown into the story. No episode is a waste, but not all of them focus on the political or military aspects of this deep tale. Some episodes may seem like fillers, but they always provide either character development or background for the world Code Geass is set in.\nOverall, Code Geass is magnificent, a coming together of wonderful story telling, strong characters, intrigue, large scale Mecha battles and light hearted school/harem type events. It all works together and is, without a doubt, my favorite anime yet.\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3, ["text"]="\n                          \n    This anime was a very likable anime for me. The reason for this is because it was filled was lots of twists and it was filled with action that I found amazing. Also, lots of the characters are remembered because of not only their attitude and actions but their story as well. Code Geass is indeed rather tragic but I do like this about it. It also threw in some funny scenes as well which was either a fail or a rather good job. Nothing made me crack up but that was the point. Although I had a problem with some of the unnecessary things\n          \n        they added I still could get past it. I believe that also, in the first season, the characters are more likable then in the second season. (Nunnally, CC, Suzaku, ect.) Although I believe they made a certain Orange rather amazing. But overall, I believe that Code Geass is the best anime that I have ever seen and would recommend it to anyone.  \n        "},

Lelouch is very smart and can read he's enemies minds, he can deal with almost any situation and emergency and he thinks fast, and doesn't let anybody touch hes self confidence which i can see while watching, the moment where the enemy laughs thinking he won or he that just hit a critical point, but he realizes that Lelouch is ready for it and he already knows about it. other characters have their own stories, Lelouch's rival and the opposite of him (suzaku) even thought he's a good guy , he has courage, he's strong , however he disappointed me, and i didnt much like him at all. other main characters are most likely on Lelouch's side and he doesn't think twice to use them.\nENJOYMENT: this anime was very good to watch, i dont wanna say fun because it did have those sad and bad moments which were good but not fun, i did really enjoy and i recommend it to anyone since it doesnt concetrate at a specfic thing, it's a popular anime that coincedintally was put together to make a masterpiece.\n        "},

It tends to lean away of the typical muscle-head of a main character in most action anime with a intellectual and dynamic character that does not exceed the capabilities of a normal human being (except of or course when he's using Geass and is in a nightmare frame). \nAt first i was skeptical about watching it seeing as though im not a big fan of giant mechs and robot battling, but the story was intense and inviting. This anime has a great balance of action, realism, story, dynamic characters, and fan service (hell\n          \n        yeah!), I highly recommend it for anyone looking for an in depth anime.\nTo sum up, the story of Code Geass is amazing, it is a must-see anime.

I didn't really know how popular this anime was before I began watching it.\nNow, I'm glad to say that all the hype that goes around it is completely warranted.

Thirdly\n          \n        I'll just review the whole series as a whole, Season 1 and 2, i think it's easier for me and you, to get the whole picture. Enough ground rules onto the review!\nCode geass was one of those...life changing animes for me. Not that it taught me a life lesson like clannad ( We'll get to that later on) it just opened my eyes to what anime could be. Anime doesn't always have a righteous hero who will protect the innocent, i guess it's not just in anime, sometimes stories in general don't always have this.\nLelouch, the main character, was a serious mold breaker for me, perhaps because i had never seen a hero do stuff like that ever (I haven't seen death note but i know that there are similarities.) But it wasn't like i was relieved to have something fresh. I was almost horrified but also entranced by the end of episode one (Season 1). Here was the start of a seemingly normal school anime in my eyes and by the end i saw a sight that almost sickened me. The main \"hero\" smiling as he killed a whole troop. \nBut I also was in awe, somehow i was drawn in and that spell never left me till the end of season 1. The show had an awesome insight to the reality of war, the reality of what it means to become more than you are, to rise up from the ashes of defeat, to inspire a nation and to destroy one. \nThe show was probably my first intro to \"real\" anime. It showed real problems like corrupt governments and the power of ambition. It showed how one man became more than just one man, becoming a symbol for change.\n Through the course of the series however, i found myself hating him sometimes, namely in R2. He became this power hungry villian without a care for anybody but his goals. To some he was always like that, but to me i saw his character change in R2 and i didn't like it. But the fact that I was so bothered by this can attest to the power the story, the characters and whatnot had overall.\nBy the ending couple of episodes i now looked upon a man who i felt like i grew up with and now stood before me, completely changed. Instantly I found that I was back to the horrified yet awed outlook i had for this character/story that had started so long ago. Though this time it was different.\nThen the ending rolled around and...it hit and stuck with me like no other anime ever did before watching this. Without spoiling, (This is incredibly hard to write and not spoil...course if you haven't seen this yet you are missing out on anime gold!) I couldn't of thought of a better ending. Basically after i got through the ending, I found myself utterly amazed and shellshocked at the same time.\nOverall this anime changed my thoughts on anime and what it means to be a good one. you don't have to be as serious as this one to be good to me, but rather it's ability to not only draw me into the story but to also have someone like me care so much about these characters and their choices/ actions, good or bad. \nSo I say to anyone reading still, watch this anime! If you're not sure yet after this, watch the first episode. I believe you'll know whether or not you like it by the end of just the first, I know I did. Course if you have already watched this anime and are reading just because or you hate it and want someone else's opinion on it, I say watch it again. When I first finished I hated it, but eventually I watched it again, a little older and I could appreciate what was going on and understand why things were done/ said. It's one of those animes that can truly be what you want it to be, a tragedy or a inspiring tale of what someone would do for the greater good; and the main character can be a villian or a hero, a harbinger of death or a savior of the world...\n-Eriad Eternas-\n"},

Not because it's bad (well kind of) but because it's so disappointing. To be fair episodes 1-21 are some of the best anime I have ever seen each episode left me wanting more and more. The fight scenes were incredible, the story had me enraptured, the characters themselves were wonderfully dynamic in short by episode 22 I was ready to give this anime at least an 8 possibly a 9 or a 10. What proceded were four of the worst episodes of an anime I have ever watched. Near the end of episode 22\n          \n        I witnessed perhaps one of the biggest and most aupaulling plot contrivances I have ever seen in any tv show period. What follows are three episodes of rediculousness as a result of said contrivance with all of these episodes having a multitude of these types of moments themselves. That's not to say the previous episodes were perfect either it's just that their convienient timings didn't have that big an impact on the story and the impact it did have were on parts of the story that were of little consequence. Meanwhile during these last four episodes the show introduces a character that is essentially the entire reason the show ends the way it does and on top of that the show ends on a fucking cliff hanger. I'm just so upset a show this good got so bad. It seems the writers wrote themselves into a corner and didn't have enough episodes to write themselves out of it. This anime left a bad taste in my mouth but I can't let 4 episodes of utter trash ruin 21 episodes of near perfection it doesn't seem right but at the same time I can't give this show higher than a six. It's disappointing I know but than again so is this show \n        "},

For example, they try to put a lot of twists and mystery into the story like Death Note, but the story was much more predictable than death note. Quite a bit of fighting/action scenes but just good but not great. There were school/romance elements but nothing more than okay... also there are episodes that are funny/light-hearted but not really fit with the rest of the show. \nThe series was interesting enough for me\n          \n        to keep watching, since I am already watching. Then it gets better in the 2nd half of the season. First, the story telling gets tighter as the plot steadily moving forward. The story itself also gets more interesting. The twists are never as good as Death Note (first 25 episodes) but there are more mystery elements that keep me glued to the monitor. There were also great character developments in the 2nd half of the season. Especially for Lelouch, we learned a lot about humanity/emotional side of him so that he is not just a smart and cold blooded and have weaknesses. Personally As character build, I think this is more successful than Light in DN. It also makes it easier for audience to root for him. They also did a nice job building up Euphy which make her story some powerful.\nI'd give the first ~15 episodes a 6, last half a 8, average 7. I do expect season 2 to be better than season 1\nOVerall 7\nArt 8\nSound 7\nCharacter 9\nStory 8\nEnjoyment 8\n        "},

Or in English (pardon if I'm wrong), the Rebellion of Lelouch.\nBased off an alternative world set in the year 2017, the empire of Britannia's ever-growing grasp has conquered Japan - and has subjugated its citizens. The stark divide between the citizens Britannia and the Japanese locals of Area 11 (the renamed settlement of Japan) thus becomes the impetus for rebellion. The story has a solid foundation, one that allows for both creative manipulation of the direction that the story takes and therefore the potential to keep the audience entranced throughout the whole series… which it certainly does. From the very\n          \n        beginning to the really fucking annoying cliffhanger at the end of the episode 25, the story is constantly evolving.\nWith the notorious scattered amounts of invisible, yet overwhelming, “power,” it is no wonder that most anime fans consider Code Geass to be extremely similar to Death Note. Additionally, the chaotic sense of retribution and justice only make it even more similar. The only differing factor would be the mechanized aspect of the series - one that draws a much more dynamic aspect rather than the highly strategic one of Death Note. I am immensely glad that I did not watch Code Geass and Death Note back-to-back. The reason being that if I did, I would have thought all anime to be as good and as strategic as they were, and then be throughly disappointed in the most of the remaining anime industry.\nNow, I have a few criticisms when comparing Code Geass to Death Note. Hopefully, these criticisms will help justify why I gave Code Geass a 9 and Death Note a 10. First, the intentions in Code Geass are not really clear. Although Lelouch claims to be trying to create a better world for Nunally, it seems like he is deluding himself into simply taking vengeance against Britannia for personal reasons (which I won’t disclose). And although Light’s goal is seemingly convoluted at first glance, he seems to be making progress at nearly every episode. Second, going off of the previous point, a lot of the plot twists remain unexplained. For example, who is C.C.? What are the locations that case Geass to be activated? What are the Emperor’s real goals? Who killed the mother? Third, Code Geass has unnecessary fan service - I don’t need to say anymore. \nNow, although I like to focus on the criticisms, that doesn’t detract from the overall pleasure of watching Code Geass. Ultimately, I will give it the same verdict that I gave FMA: Brotherhood - Overrated, but still excellent. \n        "},

Despite its nature, which is significantly darker than usual even for this kind of story, it has the potential to appeal to a wide audience. It makes use of numerous genres to various degrees; from psychological thriller to mecha action, from school romance to superpowers. The question is: does it manage to remain interesting while doing so?\nThe strongest point of Code Geass is its thrilling story. A very interesting plot that unfolds at a proper pace, it will most likely keep you\n          \n        coming back for more. The story is definitely what pushes Code Geass up.  So, what about everything else?\nVisually, Code Geass is fine. My main problem with the art was that everyone looked too good. Apparently, in the Code Geass universe, non-attractive people are extinct. Other than that, the art pulls its weight. The landspaces looked good, the action scenes were fine, the characters were a bit inhuman but nothing severe.\nSound-wise, Code Geass was also fine. The music was mostly un-interesting, but it was used rather well. As for the voice actors, while most of them did a good job with the material they had available, that material could have been better. The protagonist in particular suffers from this problem; he speaks almost exclusively with a very deep voice and an imposing tone regardless of the situation. Thankfully, most of the main cast avoids any major problems.\nΤhe characters are a bit of mess. Due to the big cast and the heavy plot, you are going to see a lot of character development. You may get a bit lost trying to figure out each character's personality, since many of them have limited screentime. Despite that, they are generally interesting, especially the various relationships between them.\nSome things damaged my enjoyment of the show. It got increasingly chaotic and incoherent as it went on. Also, it kinda fails when it comes to switching between \"serious\" and \"fun\" settings. Finally, there was too much of people talking to themselves and treating things unnecessarily seriously. Despite these issues, the show was generally enjoyable. It’s easily to overlook such issues due to how engaging the storyline is.\nUltimately, I’d recommend Code Geass to almost everyone. There are only two categories of anime watchers that I believe won’t enjoy it: those that don’t enjoy serious settings and those that are overly critical. If you don’t belong in either of these categories, Code Geass is definitely worth your time.\n"},

I was sad when Zero/leluch was forced to kill his sister, because i saw Euphy as a bright star\n          \n        in the series. \nZero/Leluch, it is understandable that he fight to avenge his killed mother and his sister which end crippled due stress and injury, but his power of manipulation (i dont mean on GEASS) to use everyone for its own causes and care less for everyone is something that make me dislike him. Yes he had his own personal reasons but that doesnt mean he can play with everyone else lives. \nHowever i did understand later. Massive super power like Britannia, i doubt it would ever be possible that in our real world such power exist. Every country that came to point where it grow in size and power to much eventually falls. This happens many times in our history and probably it will happen again. \nI really like knightmares, most definitely well armed and maneuverable mech can beat MBT without much problem. Once when we create our first mechs, MBT will really be obsolete. \nLancelot is probably one of best mech at the beginning of this series, but even with Suzuku briliant use of it, it is not invincible. He is shown to be great annoyance to Zero and black knights. \nKnightmares were probably best part in this series although i would say that their designs are in some way funny. Especially cockpit section which is the weakest part of them. \nI cannot give 10 to this but 9 is more then good.

Of course, I didn't believe myself, but I could do nothing but hold this opinion of the series for many years to come until maybe towards the middle of 2008 or so when I decided to give the series a second shot and was absolutely thrilled with it and the then airing R2.\nIn fact, I tend to proclaim that Code Geass is the anime that got me\n          \n        back into anime.\nCode Geass is honestly a brilliant series that still holds up today after what I believe to be my fourth or possibly fifth rewatch. I feel that this rewatch has brought my appreciation of this very series even further though, as I have updated my own rating on my list from a NINE to a TEN. This series is so well written, so cleanly animated, that it shines with nary a fault in the year 2016. The fact that I was glued to my seat, the fact that I nearly never found myself bored while watching, the fact that even in moments where I thought I wasn't going to enjoy myself I ACTUALLY ENJOYED MYSELF, are just good reasons that I will look to this series as a modern classic\nWith all done and said, a bit of a run down: Set in the world where in which the British Empire (known as Brittania) in nearly every possible turn of history was able to further expand itself, becoming a super power controlling one-third of the world (this includes the USA), Japan is invaded by the overwhelming militarily and technologically superior Brittania, who bring to the battle bipedal mechs referred to as KnightMare.\nIn the current day Japan, we follow a young boy named Lelouch who gets caught up in the middle of Japanese rebels attempting to steal what supposedly a dangerous chemical weapon. However, as dangerous as the situation may be, for Lelouch, all things will unexpectedly be going in his favor, as he leads the rebellion in his personal fight against Britannia.\nThe writing then is honestly very good and well thought out. To the point I have been wondering just how much of this series was thought out early on and how much material they had at hand. The series was just rife with dialogue and situations that kept me on the edge of my seat as I waited for it to entertain me more with the charismatic, over the top dialogue of Lelouch or the results of his master plans.\nOne little criticism, that I have seen others make, I must address though is that of Lelouch and what seems to many be all of his plans always succeeding. On the surface, this seems true. But the truth is, not everything actually goes according to plan. It's a small detail, but take note that while he does generally overwhelm the Brittanian forces in most cases, and basically ends situations in what can be called victories for his army, he never fully achieves his objectives due to an unforeseen wrench in his plan or even a major personal dilemma brought upon by a dramatic reveal within the show. Even the big twist of the show towards the end is a mark of Lelouch's greatest failure. Even when he is able to spin this failure as a means to his own end, he will forever be haunted by this accident.\nA personal issue I have with the series is with guns though. Many times, the guns don't have the sound a gun should have, sounding more like the rudimentary sound of flesh being pierced, rather than the loud bang of a gun. The other sound is what I can only describe as a pop gun. There are moments where guns sound more like an actual destructive weapon or sort of make sense with regards to the weapon itself, but these two minor issues I describe are ones that plague this series for episodes on end. It is nothing that would make the series go from Good to Terrible, but it is an issue I have nonetheless.\nMusic wise though, this series is just fantastic. This series has some of the best music in an anime I can think of. Ranging from orchestral to the strumming of an acoustic guitar, this series music is just refreshing, but so indescribably good. I can only compare the music to that of Ace Combat Zero (unintentional) as it does something similar with acoustic guitar and what I believe to be castanets. \nAnd then there's just the animation and art. The animation is at many times smooth, refined, in some cases filled with as many frames as possible, and in other cases just the right amount. The Knightmares do not appear in any way shape or form like some giant CGI robot, they look hand drawn and fantastic. A year or two after this, studio Satelight would release Macross Frontier and claim that the reason why they used CGI mecha because it was \"cheaper\", but that I feel is just a cheap excuse. \nI don't care what you say, if Sunrise could do it, then Satelight should have been able to also do at least that and then beyond. Satelight was reviving Macross, a series famous for some very detailed animated sequences of fights between giant robots and jets. Even the movie DYRBL is etched into my brain with the gorgeous detail put forth into it. But that's a story for another day.\nAs for art, the still picture, Code Geass is very colorful, lively, and vibrant. It is a well known fact that CLAMP did some of the character designs for this series, but I feel like that's not really a major selling point. Especially since you can clearly tell who was designed by CLAMP and who wasn't (I could be wrong though). But that's not bad though, the character designs are still fine overall and the series still looks gorgeous, so it all comes together in the end.\nEven with nearly ten years time gone by, Code Geass has seemingly withstood it to be a shining gem. It's not the end all be all of anime mind you, it's not the greatest thing ever either. However, it is an absolutely fantastic anime series that even with continuous rewatches, it seems, will never stop amazing me. It will never stop consuming me with adrenaline watching Lelouch go about his reign of carnage as he masterfully goes about one skirmish to another and dealing a devastating blow to the Brittanian soldiers. In a way, I am like Diethard of this series, I wish only to watch the next step of Zero's future. And I will always wish for more.\n        "},

The magical powers in \"Code Geass\" are very explicit in how they can be used and although not realistic they do feel like they fit in.\n      I highly recommend this anime to anyone that enjoys strategy and robots fighting, with a little fan service on the side.\n        "},

And I loved it.\nIts so original. So addicting. I mean the openings and closings addicted me (mozaeku kakera... love it). It just so good ppl.

And I also thought ive outgrown falling in love with Anime characters.. but Suzaku changed that idea (sorry Yufie)\n--the only thing keeping me from giving it a 10 is that there are a lot of military terms, and lots of fighting. I didnt understand what was happening during the fighting most of the time, but i survived watching it without. BUT OTHER THAN THAT- loved it to death.\nYou know what would be epic? if this anime was turned into a live-action film or TV show with japanese ppl being japanese and the Britannians being Caucasians. I swear thats a good idea. Don't you agree??\n        "},

I do believe this anime is some what of  a masterpiece. The characters are intriguing, and have great depth to them. The same goes for the story, it has action, it has depth, it makes you question not only the \"enemy\" but the so called protagonist. You will cry, you will laugh, you are going to (in several occasions) tense every muscle in your body in frustration and despair. At the end of every episode you find yourself\n          \n        pressing the button to see the next episode, it does not matter what happens tomorrow you will press the button and see the next episode, and the one after that, and after that. \nAlthough it is fantastic in every sense of the word, that only occurs because of my knowledge of a second season. Because the season ends on a cliffhanger. Had it been cancelled i would personally flown to japan(I am from norway so that is a long, long journey), and demanded an ending. So therefor i cannot give this anime a full score. Still i give it my full-fledged recommendation. \nIf you like action, watch Code Geass. If you like good characters, watch Code Geass. If you like having a good time, watch Code Geass. So what i am saying is, stop wasting time reading my review go watch Code Geass!\nPs:\nIf you have seen the anime \"Guilty Crown\" these two are very similar. They both have a main characters with a special ability more or less given to them by a mysterious women, and they both try to one way or the other take over the world in some sense. I would actually recommend you see Guilty Crown first because, i did this and enjoyed both of them very much, but i hear people have a hard time accepting Guilty Crown since it has obviously \"stolen\" much of its story from precisely Code Geass. But what you do, that is for you to decide. \n        "},

Oh yeah you even get Fanservice but a very reduced version you could say!\nBut there are things that stop it from being perfect f.e. the characterdesign by Clamp. \nAnd on top of that it makes you want things you do not get. \nYou want romance! Will you get it?\n No they kill it literally or rather they sacrifice it for the plot. A Quote from a popular Podcast:\"Sherly there was Romance. Euphemia be kidding me. I C.C.. I'm Kallen\n          \n        these jokes to a very long distance. The jokes have just gone to Zero now.\"\nWill you get an explanation of what Geass is?\n No, not really but they \"try\" it in the second season. \nDo you get an happy or somewhat satifying ending? \nNo and yes, you get a giant mf cliffhanger and a second season with one of the best endings of all time. \nYou get something you didn't expect and that is................Comedy you actually get quite a lot. \nAnd you get an even more important unexpected thing................. C.C or C² which is one of the best female characters ever, a foodmaniac and as find out later (2nd Season) super kawai.\nWith the story or the things/morals that are portrait are really worth a thought, get your excitement up and bring you back to reality. One more thing is that it plays with your feelings and your heart a bit too much for my perception at least. \nRating: 9/10 Must Watch! Now if you haven't already!\n        "},

Without giving too much away, our protagonist is a young student at a prestigious academy who has acquired a mysterious power from a young witch who befriends him as he decides to avenge his dead mother.\nAt first glance it could seem a bit cliche, (who hasn't heard a story like that along the same lines before?) but I guarantee it is worth a watch. It's not your typical Michael Bay explosion/fast cuts type of production.\nThe main characters are\n          \n        explored and developed. They have back stories and different passions that drive them. What I think is most interesting is the planning and strategy our protagonist uses to achieve his goals. Last but not least, the ending is splendid as it leaves the viewer with a sense of accomplishment since most characters are given a final view of their lives after all the dust has settled.\nI watched this every week as it was being aired on tv and I couldn't get enough.

			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=2, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Story)\nThe story of this series is incredible as it follows a genius boy with the unique ability to control minds and must use it to take down the most powerful nation in history which controls much of the world from the ground up. It progresses well and ata perfect pace with the series being broken into 2 parts which, despite being years apart, are equally as amazing. The story takes incredible twists and turns so it is impossible to know what will happen next. The story also manages to be a mecha series and use it as the back round aspect to its fullest.\nArt)\nThe art\n          \n        in this series is its week spot because it presents a very unique character design of having very thin almost odd looking characters. The upside to the art is the way that the mecha's are designed to look very sleak and one of the few series that produces mecha's that dont look like Gundams. \nSound)\nThe music used in this series is good although it is not a memorable aspect of the series. Not much can be said except that the songs selected are good in my opinion. Unfortunately, the opening themes' animation is not quite capable of summing up the series well and really give you know idea as to the plot since Code Geass' plot would be difficult to sum up in images alone.\nCharacters)\nThe characters in the series are its finest point as it presents very unique characters and gives adequate screen time to each and everyone of them. The common recurrence of characters switching sides between good and evil and being constantly pitted against each other makes things all the better. There are hence no characters that are simply loveable all the time. Lelouch Lamperouge, the main character, is the most interesting as he constantly must deal with issues of morality and having the world on his shoulders while a small backround love story develops. The villains are also very well done as it is often difficult to simply not like them due to there motivations not being definably good or bad."},
			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=2, ["text"]="                          \n    With high rating come high expectations. Code Geass, being one of the most popular and high rated anime series, have ignited my interest even though I'm not really a fan of shounen mecha. And well, at first I was really disappointed with its abrupt and clumsy commencement of the plot. The story of Code Geass, despite being impressive with its intricacy and \"wow factor\", doesn't make much sense and is based mostly on happy and unhappy coincidences. I know that a good and captivating plot is what matters the most, but not at the expense of elementary logic! Still, I can't say it is bad,\n          \n        quite the opposite it's charming as hell with its anti-hero-tactical-genius-morally-ambiguous protagonist and numerous twists and turns. \nI'm not proud of it, but I like my anime pretty. I like pretty images, pretty characters, backgrounds and whatnot. Code Geass is not pretty, oh no, it's not. Even though the animation itself and visual effects are top-notch, character design is just terrible. I know it's a cartoon, but give me a break, these are not human proportions. The soundtrack is quite good with some interesting jazz and orchestral influences, but the opening and ending themes almost made my ears explode with how unsuitable for the show they were. Who picks this stuff?\nCharacters are what Code Geass is first and foremost about. Their beliefs, conflicts, loves and alliances determine the flow of the story. The protagonist is obviously the most detailed and complex figure, full of conflict and brilliance boiling within. Still, the creators didn't avoid some painful absurdities. On one hand they struggle to create a story based on tactics, politics and the main character's reasoning, but on the other hand they fail to provide the supporting characters with even a pinch of intelligence. (SPOILER ALERT!) How could they all fail to recognize Lelouch by his voice or silhouette is still beyond my comprehension. (/SPOILER ALERT!)\nCONCLUSION\nA very good yet a bit overrated anime, with a captivating yet at times painfully contrived story and intriguing main character.\n        "},

			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=2, ["text"]="\n                          \n    I command you to read and like this Review... Wait it doesn't work that way. Anyway here's my review of the first season of Code Geass.\nThe overall story is about Lelouch Lamperouge who was a member of the Royal Britannia family, but relinquished his noble status after the death of his mother. After he witnesses an accident he finds a woman named C.C. and she bestows on him the power of Geass which gives him the power to control a person and do what ever he tells them to do. However, he could only use it on the same person only once. He doesn't like\n          \n        the world he lives in and decides to change it for his sister Nunnally. He masquerades himself as the infamous Zero and creates a terrorist organization called The Black Knights. He constantly has to fight against against the Britannian army, family members, and his best friend Suzako and as the story goes on Lelouch finds ways that his plans either back fire or effect other people.\nThe best thing about this show besides the story and characters is the battle scenes with the Nightmares when those scenes happen the animation is just incredible. The animation itself is great.\nCode Geass has a lot of memorable characters in this anime. My personal favorite is Lelouch vi Britannia. He is the best antihero I have ever scene in a movie, book, or T.V. show. I like the fact that he treats the wars he fights in like a game of chess and the fact that he has to persuade people into following his orders. Another memorable character is Suzaki Kururugi who is Lelouch's childhood friend and his archenemy in this show. The thing is that Suzaku has the same goal as Lelouch, but he tries to change Britannia from the inside by joining the Britannian army.\nThe voice acting in Code Geass is SUPERB. Especially  Johnny Yong Bosch who was incredible as the voice for Lelouch.\nNow there was a few problems I had with the show. One of the major problems was that the Nightmare Lancelot was way too powerful. Seriously it's just way too powerful even though the fight scenes with it are awesome it was just ridiculously strong.\nCode Geass is a great anime with a great story, memorable characters, and one hell of a cliffhanger at the end of the season. Only major problem was that the Lancelot was too powerful and a few other minor ones. It had great suspense and a very good soundtrack to go along with the show. Overall this show will leave you entertained and satisfied.\n        "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I like to describe Code Geass as Gundam meets Death Note meets Macbeth, but it's essentially a story of a boy who has been and constantly is screwed over by the Universe. He tries hard to follow his ideals and change the world, but, for the most part, nothing goes his way. He drops the soap, and the Universe and Society tag team him. \nTL;DR Life screws over Lelouch, Lelouch tries to fight back, get's shutdown all the time. People are chess pieces. Action, manipulation, boobs, etc. WATCH IT!\nSTORY 10: The story is outstanding. It follows the life of the student/revolutionary Lelouch Lamperouge on his\n          \n        path to the destruction of the Holy Britannian Empire. In some sense, it's a split timeline of our own history; where the American Revolution fell through, and the British remained a world Super Power. The conflict itself is reminiscent of the American Revolution, with Japan replacing the US. You can draw parallels between Code Geass and Death Note, especially when it comes to where they mess up; small mishaps or loose ends in the beginning, which in retrospect could have easily avoided, end up fucking them over. Retrospect is the most enlightening and the most frustrating tool humans have. A big part of the plot is devoted to just shit going downhill for Lelouch. It's almost as if the worst case scenario always happens to him, and even when he wins, he ends up losing. Sucks to suck, I suppose.\nART 8: The art is done well, but there isn't a factor that really differentiates it from other anime. Most of the characters are tall and skinny, and I found it somewhat difficult to differentiate between the Japanese and the Britannians based solely on physical appearances in multiple settings, with the only noticeable difference a very subtle change in skin tone. I was, however, very impressed with the designs of the mechas and the detail to the background. And for whom it may concern, there are, albeit scarcely, tits in this anime. \nSOUND 8: The openings and the endings for the entire series are pretty damn good, because they fit the tone of the series well. Personally, I'm not one to pay too much attention to sound, but I definitely liked the classical/opera background music which smoothly accompanied the Luke-I-am-your-father announcements and other such scenes.\nCHARACTER 10: This is by far the best part of the show, with Lelouch obviously being the most interesting character. He is our tragic hero, our Macbeth, our Yagami Light, our Walter White. He is manipulative, creative, and morally reprehensible, and he is by far the most human character. His sense of right and wrong does multiple flips throughout the series, and it's interesting to watch his evolution from Lelouch to fully embracing the Zero identity. \nThe other characters are surprisingly good, with the second most complex character being Suzaku and his struggle with changing the world he lives in. I would have to say the most interesting characters is C.C; her life and powers are so mysterious, it makes you crave answers. I also found myself emotionally attached towards Euphemia towards the end of the show. Even though it's almost always futile in the end, I love to see idealists doggedly work towards their perfect world. There is one character, and I think almost all shows have this, that I hated: Nina. She's an obsessive, racist sociopath who, in my opinion, is the only one who I wanted to die.  \nENJOYMENT 10: I couldn't stop watching it. I was burning to know what schemes Lelouch had come up with to take over the world or learn more about the \"tragic\" death of his mother (the quotation marks are important, as per the second season). Though, it was kind of sad to see him constantly getting shafted by the Universe at almost every turn; I actually wanted him to succeed. \nOVERALL 10: All in all, it was an amazing anime, with plot development at a perfect pace, and mystery at every corner. I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone looking for something to binge on.\n        "},

Its set in the near future, so therefore has Mechs (knightmare Frames), and some weird magic (geass)\nI honestly didn't enjoy the first episode, but got hooked after watching the second and managed to finish it. It was/is a very popular anime so I guess I don't have to much to say that hasn't already been said.\nStory: 9\nGood story, I guess it lost a point for\n          \n        the Geass power, as I would have rather seen the show without some weird super powers. \nArt: 10\nAmazing, well funded, awesome fight scenes. I am rather picky when it comes to art, but this had every detail down perfectly. For example, in one episode early on, Susaku is studying for History, I thought it was cool how I could push pause and read the book perfectly. \nSound: 10\nOne of the better sound tracks, I added some of the songs to my iPod, I like techno music alot, so the background music of anime fight scenes does occasionally get on there. \nCharacter: 9\nIt lost a point because I am still pissed because my ex dumped me for Lelouch (kinda, after watching Code Geass she became one of those fan girls who absolutely adored him, but I think she dumped me for different reasons). On a more related note the characters were good, thats why it got a 9. Not really sure what to say here. \nEnjoyment: 10\nI was able to watch it (and its sequal) 3 times. I really repeat watch animes, but this was just enjoyable to do that. \nOverall: 10\naveraged out to 9.6 or round 10.\nWell kinda, its the same thing as enjoyment, if its good enough to be virtually flawless after watching it 3 times, I think its good enough to get a 10/10. \n        "},

Im not really a fan of mecha anime but Code Geass caught my attention. \nI would recomend this anime to anyone who claims to be an anime fan. This was one of the only anime that the dub was entirely decent. I however watched the sub. It was short enough to not trail on and get boring, the characters were some of the few in an anime that i actually got emotionally attached too.

			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=2, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    The story is now set in an alternate timeline and the world is split up. The premise is melodramatic, stagy and assertive enough. The story is set after the Britannian Empire's hammering on Japan and stripping the people in it off their rights and proclaiming it now as Area 11 and declaring the citizens as Elevens now. Lelouch is a Britannian prince who is ostracized to Japan as a deal along with his sister Nunally after his mother is killed. Lelouch now embarks on a quest to obliterate Britannia through the use of his intellect and Geass, impelled by revenge and virtuously abstruse altruism. He\n          \n        decides to use his Geass, which he can use to command anyone once, and find out about the murder speculation of his mother, blemish the Britannian Empire and create a better world where Nunally and he can live happily. Promptly, in the process he becomes the leader of a resistance group, The Black Knights and seemingly gaining power from other resistance groups for his rebellion. \n\nFrankly, this was my first anime of Sunrise. And also I was never a fan of Clamp nor I'm well-familiar with it. The character designs were original, peculiar and pretty, they as much impressed me. Though, they ARE good and attractive, they look weird and strange when looked at from certain angles. The animation was well done, and the colors were used brilliantly. The music is appropriate and mostly unobtrusive, whether the mood is serious, exciting, relaxed, mischievous, dramatic or tragic. Loved C.C's themes and other characters' themes too. And the opening and ending sequences were decent, now they are good, really good, but a series like this could've orchestrated something more fitting for the milieu of the show. \n\nLelouch who practically carries the show by himself receives the most character development. Lelouch procures a subtle personality, such as his emotional range and a sense of humanity emerging from his internal conflicts which sets him apart. C.C is enigmatically perplexing character with a mysterious past, as we've only seen bits and pieces of information regarding her background, yet she is an engrossing and fun character by virtue of her interactions. Other characters get decent amount of attention as well, but I feel that too many characters were introduced, though, this shows needed them equally. The secondary characters were fun to watch too.  \nSpoiler, skip this section if you haven't watched the first season. \nThe reason there is a separate section for Suzaku is as he is the most despicable and hated character in the series. But, I didn't 'hate' him. There was no reason to hate him. He is way too self-righteous. Most of the people reason that he always puts his life before others and wants to die. There is clearly nothing wrong with this. This may be subjective, the whole Suzaku thing, but he isn't as despicable as people deem. He is weak, thus, he decides to protect anyone and everyone putting his life on the line. Lelouch wants to protect too and he is buffed with human consideration but he has Geass and he can 'change' the world or so he thinks. But, Suzaku being weak and considerate doesn't find anything wrong with losing his life for someone else. He killed his father to prevent a war when he was a kid, this is something people can only think of. He doesn't like unnecessary blood-shed, though his character flaws from time to time. I'm poorly wording my thoughts, but people who've watched Pandora Hearts can juxtapose Suazaku with Oz. \n\nI tried my best to avoid mecha as much as I was capable of. But I made an exception for Code Geass and I have to say that I really liked mecha, or the use of mecha in the series. Though, mecha is the only driving aspect in the show. Code Geass features Knightmare Frames which are of humanoid shape and are considerably tall than someone piloting it. I've really started liking mecha and would love to watch more of those. \n\nI never wanted to compare it, but I might as well do it. I'll most probably contrast Code Geass with Death Note. The animation, the animation used in Death Note was fitting for it, but Code Geass' animation was way better. The audio, Code Geass delivers appropriate and a variety of soundtracks but the opening and ending sequence weren't fitting as the ending and openings of Death Note are. Death Note was rather slow when compared to Code Geass but it was intense. Code Geass has its intense moments as well, but they are not substantial and are not always good. But, Code Geass is wonderfully well-paced and didn't fail to bore me, even in some of the stagy episodes. \n\nI thoroughly liked and enjoyed Code Geass. The first season was appreciably entertaining and seldom boring. I genuinely appreciate both well-done proportions of the show and absurd scenes and flaws. The show is not a masterpiece, for everyone, nor it'll please each and every viewer. However, Code Geass is an iconic anime, it’s not perfect, and maybe a little overhyped, but there’s still a reason people get so excited about it. Watching Code Geass brought me many hours of joy, and that’s something none of its problems can take away.\n"},

Ever. \nI started this show out of the blue, thankfully free of any hints of what to expect (only that I should find some parallels between it's protagonist and Kira from Death Note). And I'm glad for that. This is an experience that I savoured alone without any opinions to bias my judgement - not that that'd be a problem. It's a general consesus that this show has a lot going for it.\nI was immediately hooked by a thriller that took on many different shades. You can't pin it as a\n          \n        mecha, but it has mecha elements. You can't pin it as action, but it sure has it's healthy doses of those. The intelligence and brilliance of the characters, and the tense plot developments from what should be a simple plot tool - the geass.\nBy the time I was going on to 20 episodes I had long discarded labelling Code Geass as an anime. In your hard drive you know sometimes when you divide up your shows between 'Anime' and 'Series?'(as in live action series). I silently dropped Code Geass into the 'series' folder. And I just kept watching from there.\nFantastic piece of work, and a great story. I write this review with the second season in mind as well. It's pretty much a given that if you watch this you'll watch the second season, and you should expect a great ride. Make what conclusions you will, this is a great show.\nFor those not sure what's happening in this show you're best bet is the recommendations: The story is driven by a protagonist very similar to Kira from Death Note. Mecha fans will also be able to find some refuge in this show, and anyone in for a good psychological thriller will be interested in this. By the way. I really mean it when I say psycological thriller, I just want to make that clear..\n        "},

I'd say the art is nothing special compared to other anime I've watched, but it gets the job done.  My favorite aspect of CG are the characters.  The directer put in many sub characters that had their\n          \n        own backgrounds, which I like because it gives each episode a decent plot.

			{["score"]=9, ["helpful"]=1, ["text"]="\n                          \n    Okay, my review of Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion.  \nThe story is about Lelouch Lamperouge, a 17 year old exiled prince from the superpower country named Britannia.  He and his little sister were exiled to Japan by Lelouch's father, AKA the Emperor. Thus, Lelouch has a vendetta against his home country.  In Japan (overtaken by Britannia, re-named Area 11) there is much resistance to Britannians, and many terrorist attacks occur.  Lelouch gets caught in one, and gains a mysterious power from a mysterious young green haired girl, and this is how it starts.  \nStory: The story to me is\n          \n        pretty interesting, with the alternate timeline. I loved how the creators added in some supernatural aspects to it as well.  Unfortunately, you really have to pay attention to what everyone is saying, because almost everything is important, you may get lost.  And really, every episode delivers something to the plot, even though it may seem like a filler.   \n-9\nArt: Well the animation is very clean and crisp, and the fight scenes are nice as well, the character designs are very lovely, except they're inconsistent with them sometimes...  Not much else to say here.\n-8\nSound: The openings songs are good/bad. The first one is great, second one eh, and the last episode opening was pretty nice.  The ending songs are pretty boring, however. The voice actors do a pretty good job for the characters, and the sound effects are good.\n-7\nCharacter: Even though a lot of people hate the characters in this series, I really like them.  There's Lelouch, you either love him or hate him, and Suzaku, the annoying hypocrite. (Every series has one, right? :P)  There's sarcastic, mysterious C.C.  Innocent, pure Euphemia, spunky bad-ass Kallen.  Really, I don't see much wrong with the characters.  Just ignore all the nit-pickers... \n-9\nEnjoyment: Very enjoyable, especially episodes 22-25.  This series always makes you think, and never ceases to amaze you.  Even with its faults, Code Geass delivers.\n-10\n\nOVERALL: 9\n        "},

From the studio Sunrise who brought you Gundam Seed, Inuyasha and Visions of Escaflowne goes all out with this addicting series. This series is like the combination of Gundam Seed and Death Note but much more cooler. I like the story because there are many interesting plot twist and every episode you won't be bored.

I was not a mechas fan and I felt the first 6 episodes made the show appear to be a carbon copy of Death Note. I continued watching the series however and it is now my favorite. At its premiss it is similar to Death note however it has a much more intricate and enjoyable story filled with alive, complex characters that really help make the story so compelling. It takes a story of war and terrorism and nicely intertwines it with a bit of romance, high school life, and comedy. Its an anime that will\n          \n        take you one a crazy ride. It has more plot turns and strategic planing then death note. The mechas in this anime may initially turn people off but I suggest you watch it any way. The mechas take a back seat to the story, and the fights are not about who has the strongest robot, but instead are  multi mecha battles that are won base on strategy, tactics, and planing. \nCode Geass nicely incorporates many themes into its story and characters, so no matter what type of anime you prefer i suggest you try code geass.\n        "},

It is also one of the most intriguing plot lines i have followed yet.\n The idea of the plot might be a bit cliche; however, the way everything has been put together is more than just simply interesting. \nAlso, the characters are interesting especially the character of Lelouch. His character till today remains unrivaled in the anime world. He was not your usual hero, neither was he all bad. He was a classic mix of good traits and bad traits plus superior intelligence, making him a very relatable\n          \n        character. At one point, in the anime i started wondering what it would be like for me if i actually ran into such a character as Lelouch in reality. \nThe subbed version for me is the best approach to watching any anime. That way you can listen to the emotions as accurately as they have been projected by the originally selected voice actors. As for me, my love for the character of Lelouch arose rapidly after hearing his voice, the way he emotes, and not to mention his manic humourless, plain evil laughter. \nThe Code Geass art is also one of the best i have seen. It seems a little strange at first, but once you go on, you see some major improvements done on the characters, which just makes them all more appealing and attractive. \nAll in all, Code Geass has one of the most bad ass story telling techniques i have seen today. It raises alot of questions, and boldly approaches the topic of RACISM in our society today. \nIt highlights the presence of the subtle not so subtle racism and discrimination that still continues in our society of today, despite the technological developments, and advancement we find in most other areas of society today. \nI love the show but R1 and R2, and i strongly believe its one of the best stories ever told such that i time myself, and give myself intervals after which i watch Code Geass all over again, and appreciate it all over again. :) "},

From epic mecha fights (or 'knightmares' as they're called) to romance, drama, humor, pretty boys and girls that don't completely suck (well at least not all of them). It starts in the conquered nation of Japan or 'Area 11' after Britannia took over the nation with said knightmares. Lelouch Lamperouge stars in the series as the fallen prince of Britannia who, of course, carries enough emotional baggage to carry the first and second season along for a good 50 episodes (including sound episodes and picture dramas). After the death of his\n          \n        mother and after his sweet, innocent sister became his blind, paralyzed, sweet, innocent little sister Lelouch steps down from the throne after a confrontation with his father, the emperor who also doubles as a pimp (you meet the five million siblings Lelouch has later on in the series). Now at age seventeen he's determined to destroy Britannia at all costs no matter what and does so through the help of a strange power and the mask he wears in front of the rest of the world... literally. \n	  Code Geass is really truly a unique anime with the exceptions of some of those cliché character properties, the plot really is very enjoyable, interesting and heart wrenching all at once. Even the characters with some properties of being 'ordinary but not,' as you see in the description of almost every anime, the way they all tie together really just gives the plot so much more depth. With all the double lives lead, the expressed romantic interests and the bonds the characters have with each other really just makes you sit on the edge of your seat. Another thing that makes Code Geass so much more interesting is that there is no determined 'bad side.' While so many people compare Code Geass with Death Note I would have to disagree completely. In Death Note after about 7 episodes you can tell what side you're on but in Code Geass it remains hazy until you actually pick a side yourself. \nEverything throughout the series is just planned out and executed almost perfectly through the usually three to four episode arches which all bleed together to give you one big link of a show. But by the way each episode is expressed really just gives off a very serious and somber ring to it. You can tell by the lack of chibis or the usual anger marks and sweat drops or other anime trademarks. This also gives the artwork a really original spin on it. While you might hear a lot of complaints about the long and gangly stick people the artwork truly is outstanding and you don't come to appreciate it until you hit the second season. Every episode is consistent in its art and give off the appropriate emotions of the characters. It really is just fun animation to watch (even though some could say Clamp really *should* feed their characters a bit more). However the knightmares are also drawn and designed in such a way that is just fantastic. As the series goes on you can tell the difference between an upgraded knightmare and a piece of crap like the Glasgow, a version of the knightmare that is shown in the first episode. \nBut after all is said and done what really separates Code from other mechas is that it doesn't revolve all around the robots. Sure there are the epic fight scenes, battles between man and machine and wars that the plot depends on but by all means it is not a normal mecha. With the rivalries shown between the characters it's hard to show these oppositions without the giant glowing robots. After a certain point it just dawns on you that it's necessary. The show mainly revolves around the strange power of the Geass and all those affected by it. After a mysterious girl by the name 'CC' gives Lelouch the power of the Geass it seems that trouble and destruction follows in his footsteps as he goes through personal hell to conquer it. Of course Lelouch is not the only one who has received a Geass and they are not all the same either. The one Lelouch receives gives him the power to control anyone after looking them in the eye (though when has it ever been as simple as that?) and giving them a direct command. This show really expresses the weight of death, war and that very fine line between wrong and right. Overall I highly recommend this anime and rate it a 9 out of 10.      "},
			{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=0, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    It used to be difficult more me to answer what my favorite anime was, but I feel fairly secure in saying that it is Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion. At first I was apprehensive because of the show's unorthodox art style, but in the end the characters and story were so vibrant you hardly even cared.\nStory: For me, the standout element to Code Geass is the story. While it often pushes it with the amount of Deux Ex Machina present, it pulls it off in such an engaging way that no episode ends without you wanting to watch the next one (showcased by the\n          \n        fact that I binge-watched both seasons within a 2-3 day time period). While there's plenty of plotholes if you look for them hard enough, the story is so fun and interesting, the methodical feel to all of our protagonist's actions will leave you dumfounded regardless. Even with the odd filler episode, there's not really a dull moment in this show.\nArt: Again, I was apprehensive to Geass' art style at first, as it's quite obviously proportionally awkward and, not going to lie, seeing the characters almost appear cross-eyed at times was enough to get a snicker out of me. But the thing is, Geass made it work. The art was dramatic and bold, giving the appropriate atmosphere when needed, and the fight scenes were pretty badass.\nSound: The very first opening aka COLORS by FLOW will always make me nostalgic despite being such a cheesy opening to such a serious series. Also at the end of R2 Continued Story by Hitomi Kuroishi makes for a heart-wrenching but artfully conducted conclusion. Dramatic scores at Lelouch's many dramatic moments really solidify the intensity of the situation.\nCharacter: While there are many characters to discuss, we will focus on the most iconic one of all and our main protagonist/antagonist, Lelouch vi Brittania/Lamperouge. The great thing about Lelouch is that blurred line between protagonist and antagonist, to the point where half the time you're trying so hard to love him as he loses his humanity more and more each episode (in fact, for a good part of my time watching I referred to him as Lelouch the Douche. Bc let's be real). Yet, Lelouch is the prime example of how to do a true anti-hero correctly. His internal conflict is complex and constantly changing, keeping the audience interested, and I actually loved not ever truly knowing how he felt about a situation. We get to see the metamorphosis of Lelouch's motives as his mentality degrades, but in the end of it all you're never quite sure what he was feeling the entire time. Despite his amny very questionable actions, you grow an attachment to this character as the story progresses. Lelouch was the stand out element of the entire show in my opinion, and what makes Geass so memorable.\nOverall: Code Geass is a classic that has earned its title. It's riveting, and despite having Gundam, doesn't rely heavily on the Gundam element, has a colorful cast of characters that are constantly changing in response to the plot, and an intricate and all around engaging plot. Geass is one of the shows that truly shows off the art medium known as anime's true potential for storytelling.\n        "},

			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=0, ["text"]="                          \n    More or less directly copied from my review on Anime Planet\n-----------------------------\nWARNING: THIS REVIEW WILL COVER SEASON ONE ONLY.\nI found it really hard to write this review. It's not that I had no thoughts, I just couldn't find the words.\nSTORY\nGenerally, I rate the story on how much it interested me, rather than how plausible or unique it is. I also add points for comedy if it's well done, and subtract from my final score if there are glaring faults.\nHaving said that, I found Code Geass to be immensely enthralling, even when I've already seen it once before (read: two and a half years ago). The tension\n          \n        kept me on the edge of my seat, and the twists still genuinely surprised me. i even became more emotionally invested towards the end.\nHowever, it's also towards the end that I had some problems with; not just in how the story made one of the more shocking twists of the show (no matter how much it was foreshadowed), but also the ending. It actually ends on a huge cliffhanger, basically ordering you (no pun intended) to go watch season two, and I do so hate it when that happens.\nANIMATION\nI never do have much to say about the animation. Despite re-watching Code Geass for reviewing purposes, i eventually found myself overlooking the art/animation in favour of the story, which I really shouldn't be doing. Overall, the art was good, bright and colourful, and particularly detailed when the scene was set in one of the \"ghettos\", and the animation was mostly well done.\nSOUND\nThe BGM was largely forgettable for me, bar one or two tracks. It mostly fit well with the current situation, but more often than not, I wouldn't really notice it, particularly the Ashford Academy scenes.\nCode Geass sports two main opening themes that split the majority of the show between them, the second one being the worse one, IMO. On the other hand, I often found myself singing along to the first OP - Colors by Flow - as well as humming the first ED - Yuukyou Seishunka by Ali Project. This ending just seemed to fit CG more than the second one did, thought that's probably just personal preference butting in again.\nThere is, however, a third opening - Hitomi no Tsubasa by access - that took up the slot for the finale. This opening left a long-lasting impression on me, and personally edges ahead of Colors as favourite CG opening.\nThe voice actors largely do their jobs very well, with Jun Fukuyama doing a very good job as Lelouch. Thinking back, there was not a single voice that didn't really suit their characters, though that's probably because this WAS my second time watching CG, regardless of how long ago I first watched it.\nCHARACTERS\nThe characters, for me, were rather hit-or-miss. On the one hand, you have Kallen, the hot-headed ace pilot who is determined to reclaim Japan's freedom; Cornelia, who does a very good job at being the villain/hero (depending on whose side you're on); and Lelouch, the magnificent schemer who slowly falls further into darkness. Being the main character, he gets the most character development, initially seeming apathetic towards the casualties of his fight against Britannia, and all the bloodshed starts taking its toll, both emotionally and psychologically.\nOn the other hand, there are characters that annoyed me for whatever reason. For example, we have Suzaku, who is very much against violence claims that he will fight to change Britannia from the inside despite doing nothing more than keeping his own people under the Empire's thumb; and then there's Nina, who honestly doesn't seem to serve any sort of purpose to the story whatsoever. She was the one that pissed me off the most, really, and every time she's on-screen, I wonder just why is she there.\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nCode Geass is one of those anime that will always be talked about, either in a positive light (fanbase who defend the show against every argument) or a negative light (haters bashing it at every turn). Either way, try to ignore the hype and the spoilers floating all over the internet, and give it a watch. I'm not saying to drop everything and watch it now, but place it high on your priority list.\nSTORY - 7.9\nANIMATION - 8.2\nSOUND - 8.1\nCHARACTERS - 7.4\nENJOYMENT - 8.0\nFINAL SCORE - 7.92/10\n        "},

			{["score"]=8, ["helpful"]=0, ["text"]="\n                          \n    This show really surprised me when I first watched it airing on cartoon networkws' adult swim I wasn't too invested into the show I would watch a few episodes here and there. I just watched the entire show with my full attention. Not going to lie story line bored me sometimes with predictable cliffhangers, but don't get me wrong it did have me on my toes with a few plot twist that's why I enjoyed watching the show. The story itself has intense meaning and very deep and the characters correlate very well with it too even though you see more of this in the\n          \n        second season. I don't want to give away spoliers so i'll leave it at that but  every anime has that one character that they can't stand but in Code Geass I wasn't too big of a fan of Shirley but towards the end I appreciated her character in the story. I think that bugged me the most about this show is the awkward sexual tension between the main character Lelouch and possible \"companions\" Shirley, Kallen, and C.C. (C2). But no resolve was really given for this and I appropriate that as well in the show because it never really veered the focus of the show\n        "},

It is mentioned once that she is 15 years old. Another important part of Victorique's appearance is a pipe that she smokes when thinking about something. She spends her days at the conservatory at the top of the library, reading several difficult books, often in different languages, simultaneously. She points at one wall of the library and has told Kazuya that she has read almost all the books over there. Along with her sharp tongue, abusive bluntness and eccentric attitude, she possesses amazing detective skills. After Victorique saves him from a near-arrest, Kazuya finds himself being entangled in every new mystery. Because her mother was a mistress, and according to Victorique 'a dangerous person,' she was imprisoned in the depths of the de Blois mansion where she developed very un-childlike mannerisms. She was sent off to school under strict orders to never leave the campus (although Grevil sometimes obtains special permission to take her out). When she first met Kazuya she didn't like him and thought that he was annoying and stupid for climbing up all the stairs in the library. She even ignored him and made fun of him, but gradually warmed up to him and began to trust and cherish him. She enjoys 'reconstructing chaos' and often complains of the boredom that causes her headaches. Victorique also seems to love sweets, since she's always really happy when Kujo gets her anything sweet. In the end she is shown to have found Kujou's family during/after the war and waits with Kazuya Ruri at the place of the returning soldiers. Her hair color is also shown to have turned silver.
