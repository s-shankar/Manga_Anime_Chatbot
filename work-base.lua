 the main male protagonist of the series and the first diary user. also known as yuki (ユッキー, yukkī), he is a 14 year old middle schooler who is a rather quiet boy with an anti-social behavior who doesn't talk much. he mostly sees things around him as a bystander and writes it down in his cell phone diary. yuki becomes involved in the diary game when to his shock that deus, a god-like being whom he thought was an imaginary friend turns out to be real, selects him as one of twelve contestants in a 90 day battle royale where they must kill each other using their special diaries where the last survivor becomes deus' new heir. yuki's diary is called the random diary, which written from his point of view, gives a detailed explanation of his surroundings very accurately whether it be the present or the future. while versatile in any situation, the main disadvantage of the random diary is that it doesn't tells him what is happening to himself which leaves him vulnerable. furthermore, since the diary is written from his point of view, yuki can be tricked into thinking something he sees is true without realizing it which is a disadvantage for other people who use the random diary.\
 \
 unlike most of the contestants, yuki doesn't want any part of the game as he just wants to live peacefully and doesn't want to kill anyone, but is forced to play to survive and will only kill as a last resort as he is the main target by the other diary users because deus sees yuki as his favorite to win. because he is weak, in order to protect himself, he quickly makes friends and allies to help him including yuno gasai, a girl in his class who is madly in love with him and is another diary user. yuki is kind person yet is naive for quickly trusting people whether they be friend or other diary users as they may have ulterior motives. the most complex relationship he has is yuno, while yuno is a formidable ally, her mad obsessive love for him to the point she is willing to kill or use anyone so both of them can survive scares him yet despite the many things she does that shocks him. despite this, yuki still relies on yuno in order to protect himself.\
 \
 originally, yuki's main goal was to find a way to end the game peacefully without killing anyone but that goal quickly changes when during the middle of the game, his mother is accidentally killed by his father, who is also later killed by agents of john bacchus, the eleventh diary user. grieving over his parents death, yuno seduces and convinces him that in order to bring his parents back to life, he should win the game and once he becomes the new god of time and space, he can use his divine powers to bring them back from the dead. with this new goal, yuki becomes determined to win no matter what including lying, killing, backstabbing and destruction. his new behavior shocks his friends as his and yuno actions cause a series of terrorist attacks across the city.\
 he is named after jupiter, the roman god of the sky, weather and lightning.\

 famous quote: <i>\"i'm crazy!? what's crazy is this world, that refuses to let me be with you.\"</i>\
 \
 yuno gasai is obsessively in love with yukiteru (yandere) as one can safely guess from just the simple name of her future diary. yukiteru's condition and actions are recorded every ten minutes in her \"yukiteru\" diary, it also provides small commentary made by yuno in some of the entries. its most obvious weakness is that it does not show yuno's future at all&mdash;her condition, situation, or surroundings&mdash;unless it somehow involves yuki. working with yukiteru's \"random diary\" diary, however, covers both of their diaries' individual flaws; as it has been said the two make for a perfect combo.\
 \
 smart, beautiful and diligent&mdash;those who don't truly know gasai yuno would simply see the model student role she plays while at school. she is secretly obsessed with yukiteru and would do anything within her power to assist him. she can be quite clingy and is highly fond of stalking him. when obstacles arise that either endangers yukki's life or threatens their relationship, her thoughts turn murderous and she lets nothing get in the way of her path. yuno is also able to quickly analyze and adapt to unexpected situations that may arise, and she puts thoughts into action without hesitation, performing what needs to be done without ever losing her nerves. these traits make her one of the strongest players in deus's game, despite having one of the weakest diaries for providing self survival aid. and while yukiteru is credited for triggering the greatest shift in future occurrences, yuno is the one who has created the largest influence in those events. yuno tends to carry around a box cutter with her at all times, though she will make use of other weaponry such as kitchen knives, hatchets, etc, when required.\
 \
 near the end, when yuki and company begin to seriously question yuno's motives, aru akise investigated the 3 nameless corpses in yuno's closet. he discovered two were yuno's parents, whom she had accidentally starved to death, and that the last one was a perfect dna match to yuno herself. while yuki shrugged this off initially, aru investigated further and discovered that the yuno gasai he knew was actually from a separate dimension that had already won deus' game and become god, at the price of yuki's life. she then set out to the dimension where the story takes place, killing this worlds yuno and taking her place by yuki's side in her second game. yuno kills aru before he can specifically tell yuki about the situation.\
 \
 \
 after a final confrontation between herself and mur mur against yuki and ninth, she heads to a third world where she hopes to try again, trapping yuki in an alternate reality. yuki is able to break free and manages to save the third world's yuno before first yuno attempts to kill her. yuki talks her down, and first yuno commits suicide by stabbing herself in the abdomen, causing yuki to become god.\
 she is named after juno (pronounced yu-no in latin), the roman goddess of motherhood and femininity.\

 a classmate in yukiteru's school, aru akise dreams of one day becoming the world's greatest detective. the student detective is able to correctly deduce the culprit behind the serial dog murders even before the police. \
 \
 he is mistaken for being a future diary holder due to his quick wits and superior deduction abilities. an additional evidence of his supernatural intelligence is shown through few arcs, where only akise is able to compete against yuno's analytical, deceptive mind. his physical prowess is nothing to scoff at either as he is able to overpower and out maneuver a psychotic yuno in two encounters. \
 \
 his reason for involving himself with yukiteru and the diary affair is left vague at first. but as he participated in the investigation of the diary holders and worked with masumi and minene, and after revealing himself to be apart of nishijima's plan to eliminate the 11th, akise calls a meeting at his house and reveals his intentions of wanting yukiteru to become god, yet stating his deep distrust of the 2nd, yuno. \
 \
 in chapter 17 of mirai nikki, akise admits in secret to yuno that he likes yukiteru beyond friendship, leading her to panic momentarily when he purposely wraps his arm around yukiteru's waist to aggravate her. this might be one of the reason why yuno is so anxious and aggravated whenever akise is appears in front of yukiteru. \
 \
 finally, in chapter 48, akise admits to deus that he is in love with yukiteru, however deus revealed that he only made him believe he did. akise, desperate to prove his independence from deus' will, claims a future diary and returns, attempting to convince yuki that yuno is using him. \
 \
 yuno attempts to kill akise, but his diary's power allows him to forsee her actions and guard against them. \
 mirai nikki paradox\
 \
 he is the main character in a spin off series (mirai nikki paradox) where murumuru accidentally destroyed yuno from existence, meaning yukiteru is still vulnerable from the third. so until the damage is fixed, aru collaborates with murumuru and together, take the place of the first and second. \
 \
 when akise sees yukiteru for the first time, his heart thumps, causing him to wonder out loud \"is this love?\" leading to confusion on murumuru's part. he also states that his reward for killing the third is for murumuru to save yukiteru. by the end of second chapter of \"paradox\", murumuru suspects he is gay because of his strange actions around a recovering yukiteru; refusing to leave his side because yukiteru's just too cute, stating how he could kill all the diary users to make yukiteru 'god', and so on. \

 tsubaki kasugano is a maiden and figurehead of the omekata religion. her \"thousand league eyes\" diary is unlike the other diaries, as it is a scroll, rather than a cell phone. as its name would suggest, it is able to report the future of all her followers. unlike yukiteru's diary, it is not limited to just her surroundings, but also sees far events, such as seeing the events yuki had accomplished a great distance away from where she resides. her diary can also record near events; the short-term future that will occur after only a few seconds away from the present. this provides tsubaki with massive amounts of information to work with. however, it can pose as a hindrance in times where a situation changes constantly or when she needs to react quickly.\
 \
  she was born with bad eyesight, only able to see a few feet in front of her. her parents capitalized on this by setting her up as an \"oracle\" and creating a cult around her. after her parents died in a car crash, however, she became a plaything for the omekata and was even raped by it's members. as a result of her experiences, she has become jaded with the world beyond her vision, and wishes for it to disappear. tsubaki wants yukiteru's abilities in order to avoid the prediction her diary made about herself. as she is able to control her worshippers, tsubaki does not make use of any weaponry.\
 \
 when yuki and yuno travel in time to the next world their actions shape a future in which tsubaki's parents never take their fatal car ride. this prevents the cult's transformation into an evil cult, and tsubaki is spared from her horrible fate.\

 due to having blogged many times on his cellphone, which is connected to the eighth's diary, he becomes a \"diary holder apprentice\". his diary helps him save his friends, but it only reveals his successes, not his failures, which makes yuno able to shoot him with a crossbow. since he is inadvertently working as the eighth's spy, yukki destroys his diary in chapter twenty-seven, though does not die because it was not a true future diary. \

 keigo kurusu is a police officer, so it follows with reason that his diary relates to his work. the \"investigation\" diary gives keigo information of future crimes and activities committed anywhere within the prefecture he is assigned to. whether or not this means his diary can record events that will happen simultaneously in different locations is still up in the air. its major flaw is a location issue; his diary is rendered useless at predicting anywhere outside his patrolling district.\

 calm, cool and collected, keiga at first does not appear to care about winning the game. his goal is only to stop the murders being caused by it. he makes an effort to recruit some of the other diary holders into his cause, including first and second. as the series progresses however, murmur gives him information of his sons imminent death before he should have known to make him more active in the game. he was chosen by deus to balance out the criminals and maniacs that are also taking part in the game.\

 minene uryuu is a terrorist bomber. like the fourth, her \"escape\" diary goes along with the type of profession she is involved in. whenever minene faces a dire situation, the diary will chart out the best course of actions she can take in order to get out of a tight spot. based on the function of her diary, it might even help reduce the chances of her receiving a dead end and it is probably one of the best diaries to have in deus' game of survival. the diary's only shortcoming is that there are some circumstances where the odds are too heavily stacked against minene to the point where the diary won't be able to secure an escape route for her. \
 \
 an infamous atheistic terrorist, minene is a young woman who bears a strong hatred for organized religion, particularly god. \
 \
 her hatred of religion stems from her past when she and parents were traveling in a city in the middle east but got caught in a battle, which is hinted between israelis and palestinians, where her parents were killed in the crossfire. blaming god for her parents' death, she leads a crusade of destruction against those associated with god. \
 \
 minene got involved in the diary game after a failed assassination to kill a catholic cardinal. she tried to escape but almost fell to her death and was saved by deus, who gave her an offer to save her if she joined his game. minene's diary is the escape diary, which will chart out the best course of actions for her to escape whenever she finds herself in a dangerous situation. while it means she can escape anything, it is not perfect as the diary can only tell her how to escape if there are favorably conditions that allow her any chance to escape. \
 \
 originally, she wants to win the game to destroy religion worldwide but later mellows out after befriending yuki and his friends. while she began as an antagonist against yuki, she later became his ally, becoming a big sister figure to him and both of them hold no animosity with each other despite minene was responsible for the destruction and deaths at his school and yuki was the one who blinded her left eye. she shares an interesting relationship with masumi nishijima of the police whom she met during her failed assassination of the cardinal. while she constantly dismisses all of his attempts to get to know her, she finally relents and eventually falls in love with masumi. \
 \
 in the anime, during the last episode it was shown that minene, from the second world, and masumi, from the third world live together and have two children. third world minene is still a terrorist. \
 she is named after minerva &mdash; the roman goddess of wisdom, commerce, weaving, crafts and magic. \

 perhaps the most reluctant of the bronze saints, shun is the official bronze saint of the andromeda constellation. he is a merciful soul by nature, and a firm believer in solving problems without causing bloodshed. this creates a sharp contrast between himself and the rest of the saints: whereas they will not hesitate to battle when the situation demands it, shun only allows himself to fight if it's an absolute necessity, or when his almost endless patience wears off. when any of these things happen, shun becomes an extremely vicious fighter. \
 \
 shun comes off rather badly in the movies and \"asgard\" arc. in almost every fight scene, he almost always loses, and needs his brother ikki to rescue him (except against mizar zeta syd, the one time shun defeated a foe in either the movies or 'asgard' story). \
 \
 however, in the \"sanctuary,\" \"poseidon.\" and \"hades\" storylines, shun comes off as a good, if reluctant fighter. in 'sanctuary', he manages to hold his own against gemini saga, and even manages to kill pisces aphrodite, both of them gold saints. in 'poseidon', he acquits himself nicely, defeating io, the southern pacific mariner general of scylla, and sorrento, the southern atlantic mariner general of siren. in 'hades', he manages to dispatch various opponents. as a result, he comes off looking much better in these arcs than in the movies or 'asgard'; though he may be reluctant to fight, he will when he has to, and is just as powerful or skilled as any of the other main bronze saints (shiryu, hyoga, etc.) \

 one of the truly interesting main characters in the series, hyoga appears calm, collected, and unemotional. beneath the surface, however, he is passionate and devoted to his ideals. \
 \
 the one person that forever lives in hyoga mind is his deceased mother. she died when hyoga was still very young, having drowned during the shipwreck of a doomed cruise. the ship sunk into the icy ocean, where the extreme cold kept hyoga's mother from rigor mortis. throughout the sanctuary arc, hyoga is shown to visit his mother periodically by diving into the waters. \
 \
 as a saint born under the cygnus constellation, hyoga is able to control and manipulate ice and snow however he pleases. it is also implied that he is the first to wear the cygnus cloth in 10,000 years, as the cloth was previously concealed within an iceberg before hyoga retrieved it. \
 \
 the cygnus saint's favorite technique is diamond dust (ダイヤモンドダスト, daiyamondo dasuto?), a windy attack that blasts ice and snow at the opponent in a single, concentrated point. hyoga has used this technique for other purposes, like creating a mirror that reflects certain attacks or performing this attack in the legs of the opponent. \
 \
 before learning aurora execution his most powerful technique is holodnyj smerč (ホーロドニースメルチ, hōrodonī sumeruchi?, cyrillic: холодный смерч, meaning \"ice tornado\"; renamed \"aurora thunder attack\" in the anime). it is the a technique that captures his cosmo into a single tornado, of which is unleashed via an uppercut. it is a move that, is in essence, a more powerful variation of \"diamond dust.\" the \"aurora thunder attack\" clasps both of hyoga's hands together as he expels snow and ice at the opponent. \

 \
 shiryuu sports a large tattoo-like image of a green and white dragon on his back (however it is said in the manga and the anime that it is not a tattoo but is connected to his guardian dragon star and only appears as his cosmo is rising). whenever his life is in danger, the tattoo-like image begins to fade away&mdash;once it completely vanishes, it is a sign that shiryuu's cosmos is nearing zero&mdash;as in death. \

 the greek goddess athena (spelled in greek as Ἀ&theta;&eta;&nu;ᾶ and Ἀ&sigma;ά&nu;&alpha;, in the manga and the anime adaptation respectively, and occasionally as Ἀ&theta;ά&nu;&alpha; in both) is one of the main characters in the manga saint seiya, authored by masami kurumada, and later adapted to anime. a character with a substantial importance in the universe of saint seiya, she was created by kurumada based on the mythologic persona of the same name.\
 \
 as in greek mythology, she is the goddess of wisdom and heroic endeavor, and daughter of zeus. in kurumada's mythos, she is sent to earth by the olympian gods every 250 years, when evil takes over earth. her mission during every one of her incarnations is to restore peace and bring hope, destroy the agent of evil and protect earth; to do so, she has been assisted since the ages of myth by an army of 88 youths of great strength and courage, whose fists rend the skies and whose kicks split the earth, don radiant holy armor called cloths, and are known as the saints of athena.\
 \
 athena is said to be by birthright the goddess of battle, but she didn't believe in conquest and only fought defensive wars. she hates weapons, and thus only allows her saints to battle using their bodies and armors. the only saint allowed by her to wield weapons is the libra gold saint, and it is only with her permission that the saints are allowed to brandish the weapons kept by the libra saint.\
 \
 she has opposed the ambitions of antagonist deities since the ages of myth in greece, earning herself the rejection of the other olympian gods. she has had specially a long-standing conflict with the god of the underworld, hades.\
 \
 during her 20th century incarnation she uses the name saori kido (城戸 紗織 kido saori) as her civilian identity. in the english-language version of the manga and the edited anime she is known as princess sienna.\

 ikki's personality is drastically different than his fellow bronze saints. he is very unlike his younger brother - who is almost the opposite of him: shun is calm, soft, caring and very emotional, whereas ikki is harsh, cold, aggressive, and very much of a loner. fellow bronze saint wolf nachi once pointed out that it was very hard to believe ikki and shun were related due to the extreme difference in their personalities. \
 \
 as noted by kanon in the poseidon arc and by pandora in the hades chapter, ikki's cosmos is unique to him -- it is a cosmos full of hate, anger, and incredible aggression and power, but guided by his love for his younger brother, his friends and athena. although he dislikes working in groups, he comes to battle whenever athena's saints need his help, and is often seen coming in the nick of time to save his younger brother from certain death.this tactic has always been exploited to their advantage, since the enemies are caught by surprise upon meeting/fighting him. he is a noble character, mature, and that does not doubt whenever it's necessary to sacrifice his life for his friends. ikki is a complex character, very rich in nuances. \

 he is a gold saint, guardian of the temple of aquarius, and also cygnus hyoga and kraken isaac's master in manga. in the anime, he was the master of the crystal saint, who was hyoga and isaac's master.\
 \
 camus is a cold looking saint, since he believes the gold saint, as the strongest among athena's guards, should never show exasperation or it would draw the people into despair.\
 \
 in the manga, he reveals that he actually knew that the pope wasn't working under athena's will, but he still kept working under his orders to fulfill his role as que aquarius gold saint. even so, he was glad to see his pupil fighting for the real athena.\
 \
 since milo fought hyoga, he made some quotes about camus that led the fans to believe they were close friends. apparently, this was made official since the animation of the hades saga included more interaction between them and they are depicted as friends in saint seiya episode g.\
 \
 he is named after albert camus.\
 \
 camus, unlike the other gold saints, specialized his cosmo energy not in create power by the movement of atoms, but by stopping the same movement. due to this, his power consists not in destroying the matter, but in freezing it. among those warriors who use this kind of ability, camus is considered the stronger since he is the one who can lower more the movements, creating a lower temperature. even so, and having mastered the 7th sense, camus is not able to achieve the lowest possible temperature: the absolute zero. in the hades arc it seems camus awakes the 8th sense as he is able to enter the underworld.\
 \
 techniques:\
 - diamond dust: a basic technique using the freezing cosmo energy to shot a blast of freezing energy.\
 \
 - kol'tso: although hyoga used this attack sometimes in the original series, it was never said camus also possessed it until he used in saint seiya episode g. it creates rings of icy wind that encycles the body of the target stopping its movements.\
 \
 - freezing coffin: this is a technique used to lock a body inside a block of ice, but since it has a slow realization it probably is not effective against moving targets. although he commented not even the combined strength of all 12 gold saints could break this, griffin minos destroyed it with a punch when used as a wall by cygnus hyoga. even so, when someone is locked inside it, the only way to get out is creating a temperature lower than that of the coffin.\
 \
 - aurora execution: camus's most famous and strongest technique, it claimed to be the technique that best uses the freezing power of its user.\

 is a fictional character from the manga saint seiya, authored by japanese mangaka masami kurumada, and later adapted to anime. he is one of the bronze saint's most trusted allies, and serves as the man who repairs damaged cloths in the early stages of the series.\
 \
 mu was introduced by masami kurumada in vol. 3 of his manga.\
 \
 under the tutelage of shion, the pope of the sanctuary, mu was able to become the gold saint of aries at a young age. while all gold saints have a base of psychic powers to some degree, mu has been stated to possess the strongest raw psychic talent among all living gold saints. this allows him to manipulate his gift to various degrees: psychokinesis, telepathy, teleportation, and various other powers are at his command.\
 \
 mu is very soft spoken, with a scholarly-like personality; his demeanor is very tranquil and logical, almost as if he is a professor of the sanctuary. various official translations of the manga and anime, as well as mandarin language saint seiya fans, tend to refer to the character as 'lord mu' or 'mister mu'. he is good friends with taurus aldebaran, and is very respectful to the 243 yr old master libra dohko.\
 \
 before the start of the series, mu removed himself from sanctuary after suspecting that his mentor (and then-pope), aries shion, had been quietly assassinated. he relocated to jamir, a mystical land that only those with a high level of either psychic or cosmo power can enter. from here, mu severed all ties to sanctuary and lived a life of solitude with his apprentice, the young psychic kiki. it wasn't until years later, when he met dragon shiryu and pegasus seiya, that he began to become involved in the affairs of sanctuary again.\
 \
 throughout the manga and anime series, mu is the man to go to when a saint needs his or her cloth repaired. although every individual cloth has the ability to regenerate itself after a battle, a hands-on restoration from mu is needed if a cloth has been severely damaged to the point of death. in normal cases, 1/3 of a person's total blood supply is required for mu to begin work right away. when restoring an armor, mu uses hardware tools and the elements that are used to forge a cloth: the mythical and extremely rare metal known as gammanium, used in an alloy with the legendary metal orichalcum, and finally, the radiant star dust sand.\

 kurumada described saga and kanon in his manga (vol.7) as being extremely beautiful. this was probably a reference he made to the myth associated to the gemini constellation, which represents castor and pollux, brothers of helen of troy.\
 \
 along with leo aiolia, saga disguised as the pope was the first gold saint that masami kurumada introduced in his manga, although their rank was revealed until later volumes. in his first appearance, saga presided the event in which pegasus seiya acquired the status of saint. in the anime adaptation, he was introduced in identical manner, in episode 1.\
 \
 saga served as the main antagonist for the sanctuary arc. being an excellent strategist, saga managed to put himself in control of the sanctuary (though unfairly) for many years. before the final showdown between himself and pegasus seiya, saga was portrayed as a mysterious being with his facial features hidden from view.\
 \
 saga is often described by other characters as someone with the kindness of an angel but with the darkness of a demon. this ambivalence ended up creating a split personality: a good saga that was extremely loyal to athena and an evil one that keep the control of the body most of the time and killed the previous pope to steal his place. sometimes it is hinted that the creation of his \"bad\" personality had the influence of some external force, although nothing was clearly stated.\
 \
 when it takes the control of saga's body, his hair turn from blond to jet-black (the color schemes were altered for the anime, in which saga's normally blue hair turned light grey). saga's two \"sides,\" can also communicate between them : in a dialogue the good saga reproaches his evil \"side\" to have forced him to hurt athena.\

 kanon is a character with a substantial importance in the universe of kurumada's manga, and therefore in its anime adaptation. he is directly responsible for triggering two main events:\
 the battle of the 12 temples and the resurrection of poseidon, emperor of the seas. also, kanon is notable for redeeming himself after all his sins in the past and wreaking havoc as the new gemini gold saint against the army of the 108 specters in the battle against hades.\
 kanon is the younger twin brother of gold saint gemini saga, and later took up his position as a gold saint after saga's death. before finally embracing his destiny as the gemini saint, kanon masqueraded as the sea dragon general, one of poseidon's seven sea generals.\
 \
 at first, kanon was depicted as a treacherous man, always tempting his twin brother to use his status and power to advance his status of influence beyond that of a gold saint. he concluded that their amazing and powerful abilities were gifts from the gods for them to take advantage of. much to his dismay, his brother opposed this and caused his incarceration at cape junion. after his redemption, however, kanon becomes a much centered person, much like his brother.\
 \
 kanon was the one person responsible for poseidon's awakening, although he kept poseidon just half awakened so that he could pose as the true leader of the marines as a marine general and use poseidon's army to achieve his desires. in order to do so, kanon stole the scales of sea dragon and pretented to be the sea dragon general under poseidon's order.\
 even after joining forces with the athena, kanon retains his ruthless personality and harsh characteristics scolding pegasus seiya and andromeda shun that they should never hesitate to finish their enemies, because their hesitation is a weakness that their enemies would take advantage of. even so, he quickly absorbs the honor of a gold saint.\

 algol was a silver saint sent to destroy the colosseum that the \"galaxian wars\" tournament took place in and kidnap saori kido. after crow jamian perished at the hands of phoenix ikki, algol, capella and dante revealed themselves. the phoenix saint warned the other bronze saints that algol was different from his friends, and algol soon turned andromeda shun into stone with the shield of medusa, which could petrify opponents when it opened its eyes. \
 \
 algol then battled with dragon shiryū, but was outsmarted when the dragon saint blinded his eyes with his own fingers so that he could not see the medusa shield, as last resort to stop algol and save the other bronze saints' lives. after a lengthy battle, algol charged for a final attack, but was in the end defeated by shiryū, who heightened his cosmo to \"see\" beyond his blindness.\

 pisces aphrodite is the last of the gold saints introduced by kurumada in his manga, formally presented in vol.11. aphrodite was a saint famous not only because of his incredible, mesmerizing beauty, but also for his reputation as one of the strongest among the 88 saints. however, this reputation is not explored very well in the series itself, as he is killed by andromeda shun rather easily by gold saint standards, and is beaten rather easily by aries mu during the hades saga.\
 \
 gold saint gemini saga once stated that aphrodite's beauty was the greatest among athena's saints. kurumada named him after the greek goddess of love and beauty as a reference to the greek myth associated to the pisces constellation. however, aphrodite never claimed to be the most beautiful creature, unlike the silver saint, lizard misty who claimed that even the stars' splendor dimmed next to his glory.\
 \
 it is notable that despite his incomparable beauty, aphrodite is not narcissistic. he is often described as cruel as his fellow gold saint, cancer deathmask, but not as sadistic. he is also ironic and sarcastic. according to saga, despite his beauty, aphrodite is the most feared of all the 88 saints of athena, however, as explained above, this may be due to his cruel nature as opposed to his fighting prowess. his reputation is supported more in the still non-canonical saint seiya episode g, when aphrodite appeared in front of the titan's soldiers who were awe-struck due to his beauty but also paralyzed by fear in his presence.\
 \
 a recurring motif in the pisces saint is that he considers victory as the greatest beauty of all and, therefore, he believes what makes him really beautiful would not be his physique, but absolute power. aphrodite is depicted as a man who believes the power is the only way to keep the order and assure the justice. subscribing to this theory, he believes the stronger is allowed to rule over the weak.\
 \
 some casual fans believe aphrodite is a female because of his name. in the french, european spanish&mdash;first dubbing&mdash;and chinese dubbing of the anime adaptation, he is voiced by a female actress.\

 \
 once the pope arles was informed of the galaxian wars tournament between the bronze saints, and that the sagittarius gold cloth was in the possession of the real athena, he sent some silver saints to kill the bronze saints. however, the silver saints couldn&rsquo;t affirm their rank superiority and were defeated by the bronze saints.\

 \
 later, in the twelve temples arc, it's revealed that the man who stole the identity of pope and tried to kill athena was gemini saga. in order to steal the throne and disguise himself as the pope, saga killed the previous one, aries shion.\

 from this day onwards, saga ruled the sanctuary as the pope arles. in his favor, most of the saints didn't know of shion's murder and saga's betrayal. some of them knew it, but silenced about it.\
 \
 at the end of the battle of the twelve temples, saga revealed his identity as the pope to seiya. it's also revealed that saga suffered from a split personality disorder: his evil side was dominant, and lead the sactuary as the pope arles. when his good side finally took control of his body, saga committed suicide in shame.\

          description = "when aioros was 14 years old, he, along with fellow gold saint gemini saga, were summoned to pope shion's throne room for an audience. there, the grand pope revealed that their goddess had once again reincarnated in the form of an infant, and so the sanctuary must prepare itself for the imminent wars. as shion himself was getting on in years, he decided that it was time to appoint one of the twelve gold saints as the successor to his seat. at the time, most of the gold saints were still too young; only gemini saga and sagittarius aioros were most qualified. the pope eventually selected aioros as the new pope, and asked saga to serve as an assistant to the sagittarius saint. \
 saga, possessed by his evil side, became jealous at the fact that he was not chosen for the seat, especially since he believed that he was superior to aioros in terms of power and wisdom. saga confronted shion regarding his decision and killed him. he disguised himself with the grand pope's garments, and left to kill the infant athena. inches before saga could dig the golden dagger into the baby's belly, aioros appeared and halted the blade from striking the death blow. the sagittarius berated the man he assumed to be the pope, but was quickly shoved aside. after a minute of struggle, aioros sent saga flying into the nearest wall, knocking off his headdress and mask. upon seeing saga's face and realizing that saga had killed the grand pope, aioros immediately snatched away the infant athena and ran off from sanctuary.\
 \
 saga, disguised as the pope once more, sounded the alarm and sent guards to go after the saint. it is at this point that he officially branded aioros as a \"traitor.\" he was eventually found by capricorn shura and managed to flee, but was deadly injured.\
 \
 as he was dying, he ran into mitsumasa kido, who was touring greece at the time. aioros begged the elder kido to become athena's new guardian, and explained to him the travesty that had taken place at the sanctuary. along with other secrets, kido learned about the existence of athena's saints and their cloths. entrusting the elder kido with athena and his own sagittarius gold cloth, aioros succumbed to his injuries. it is unknown as to where exactly aioros died and buried, as the whereabouts of the location is omitted in the series.\
 \
 after his death, aioros' spirit would provide assistance for athena and her saints. he has aided seiya in battles by lending the young bronze saint the sagittarius gold cloth time and time again, and even appeared once to his brother aiolia during aiolia's fight with seiya, when he demanded proof of saori's identity as the goddess athena. when the bronze saints were in the temple of sagittarius, the sagittarius cloth moved on its own (or with aioros' spirit), and fired its golden arrow into a nearby wall&mdash;revealing a final hidden message of the gold saint's last will: \"to you young boys who have reached this temple, know that i entrust athena's life in your hands. aioros.\" it is likely that aioros foresaw that one day, new saints would go to his temple to fight for athena.\
 \
 when athena's saints were once again fighting against hades's spectres, all the gold saints, both dead and alive, gathered in hades' room to break the wailing wall. only with sunlight can the wall be destroyed, and because each individual gold cloth contained a bit of solar energy, gathering all twelve would provide enough of it to properly damage the wall. at this point, the spirit of aioros appeared with the rest of the recently deceased gold saints to aid their comrades in accomplishing this task. focusing on a single point of the wailing wall, aioros guided all twelve gold saints' individual attacks into one, and struck the wall. once the mission was completed, aioros and the rest of the gold saints dissipated, leaving only the gold cloth behind.\
 \
 although aioros' moves were not shown in the original manga, there are nevertheless two techniques that were attributed to him in other mediums: one in the anime adaptation, and another in episode g.\
 \
 they are:\
 - atomic thunderbolt (atomikku sandāboruto): aioros shoots a massive amount of energy balls with some electric charge. this attack is from the anime, and was revealed during a flashback fight against capricorn shura.\
 - infinity break (infiniti bureiku): this technique allows aioros to shoot an infinite number of light darts that pierce anything upon contact. with this attack, aioros destroyed horus' army in saint seiya: episode g.\
 \
 aioros' cloth, sagittarius cloth, is armed with a bow and a golden arrow. this arrow is often depicted as the main weapon of the series and gives the final blow in four of the five movies of the series when is used by pegasus seiya. it was hinted on the original series and confirmed in saint seiya episode g that the golden arrow can concentrate the cosmos of those surrounding it if they wish.\
 \
 even though most fans recognize his given name as aiolos, the true intention of masami kurumada was to name him aioros, a japanization the name of the greek god of the winds aiolos. this can be confirmed in vol.11 of kurumada's manga, in aioros' testament. kurumada drew capitalized greek letters spelling the character's name as aioros: &alpha;Ἰ&omicron;Ῥ&omicron;&sigma;. he clearly used a \"r\" instead of an \"l,\" in the spelling of the name. if he had wanted to spell it aiolos, he would have drew them as: &alpha;ἴ&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf; or &alpha;Ἰ&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&sigma;. some attribute the discrepancy to the fact that in japanese, the letter \"l\" doesn't exist, and is replaced by the letter \"r\" in foreign words. the fandom in general is mostly familiarized with the more \"greek\" spelling, aiolos, though in some languages, such as in the latin-american spanish dub of the anime, the arguably more kurumada-accurate \"aioros\" is used.\
 \
 as revealed by masami kurumada in vol.12 of his manga, aioros became a gold saint at an early age. he had already been granted the gold saint status and the sagittarius gold cloth before the time he was 14 years old.\

 the second bronze saint to appear in the story was jabu the unicorn saint. as a fellow orphan he had been sent out with 99 more of his brothers by their father mitsumasa kido. he achieved the unicorn cloth in algeria and returned to japan to participate in the galaxian wars tournament to receive the gold cloth of sagittarius. he easily defeated lionet ban in his first match but was outmatched against andromeda shun whose chains proved impenetrable. he returned to his master in algeria to further his training, and during this time his cloth came to upgrade itself as well. when saori kido had been shot by a golden arrow, he came to her rescue and protected her from the then antagonistic forces of the sanctuary. after that he came to reside in the sanctuary and protected it against the saints hades had revived, and protected pegasus seiya's sister seika from the attacks of the god of death.\

 shaka is one of the twelve gold saints. as the guardian of the temple of virgo along the path of sanctuary, shaka has played a pivotal role chiefly in the battle between athena and the pope in the sanctuary arc, and also in the hades arc. he is referred to many times on the story as the \"the man who is almost a god\" (or closest to attain godhood) due to his immense power and is also considered the only gold saint that has full control over the araya shiki (8th sense).\
 \
 shaka alone of all saints occupies the rarefied spot between god and man, but living between two worlds has its blessings as well as curses. as a bodhisattva, and endowed with the most powerful cosmos of all the saints even overpowering libra dohko's and aries shion's cosmos, shaka well deserves his reputation as the man closest to god. even as a child in india, shaka was precocious and communed with god himself--a scene recounted in the flashbacks moments before shaka's death in the twin sala's garden. for someone whose life has just begun, he had been unusually sensitive to sufferings and mortality of human life. seeing pain and death as reflected in the ganges gives the boy shaka enough despair, if not a crisis of faith. with esoteric learning and training, shaka eventually became powerful enough to don the gold cloth of virgo, which he wore even as a boy in the manga, and wise enough to rise above human passions and attachments. for most of his life, he would look on human feelings with a mix of pity and compassion without being bound to them, with charity but not always with love. detachment seems to be shaka's answer to the poignant questions raised by human life, and he is seeing humanity from the point of god rather than living the experience. he would be disabused of this attitude in his encounter with ikki. in the end, shaka would have to remember that he is a man, as well, and return to whence he came.\
 \
 he often casts illusions to deceive his enemies. a probably illusionary technique is transmigration (or reincarnation) to the six paths (六道輪廻 rikudō rinne?) in which shaka sends his opponent to one of the six dharma's rebirth realms. these realms are, as described by kurumada: gakikai (the realm of the preta), jinkai (the realm of humans), jigokukai (the realm of hell), chikushōkai (the realm of beasts), shurakai (the realm of the warring demigods) and finally tenkai (the realm of heaven). interestingly enough, kurumada presents the buddhist realms of reincarnation as separate planes of existence from those found in the hades arc of his manga, which he derived from dante alighieri's conception of the underworld. the tenkai is considered the worst realm to be sent as mentioned by shaka.\
 \
 shaka strengthens his cosmos energy by depriving himself of his eyesight. when he opens his eyes, the stored strength is then released. due to his enormous power, shaka is called the \"man who is closest to god\". he can also use hāṃ (カーン kān?), a defensive technique that creates a barrier that encircles shaka's body.\
 \
 between his offensive techniques he can use demon pacifier (天魔降伏 tenma kōfuku?) to expand his cosmos at multiple targets or at a single one as a blast, that it was strong enough to destroy a large part of the cancer temple and heaven supremacy on evil spirits of rivers and mountains (天空覇邪魑魅魍魎 tenkūhajachimimōryō?) in which shaka summons minor spirits and sends them against his enemies.\
 \
 shaka's most powerful move, the treasures of heavens (天舞宝輪 tenbuhōrin?), is an offensive and defensive combined technique. not only traps and defangs shaka's victims, it also wipes out their five senses named as \"remove of the 1st/2nd/3rd/4th/5th sense\" (dai ikkan/nikan/sankan/yonkan/gokan hakudatsu). essentially reduces shaka's victims to living corpses by stopping the main functions of the brain that allows the body to think, also called the 6th sense. the offensive power of this attack is so destructive that it can easily destroy the cloth of the opponent.\
 \
 apart from those fighting techniques, shaka also uses two concentration ones that belong to the hinduism and buddhism like om(ॐ) to maximize his cosmo energy, allowing him to use the full extent of his power and tenpōrin mudra (転法輪印 tenpōrin'in?) to erase any doubts in his mind that could refrain him during the fight. tenpōrin is the japanese name for the dharmacakra.\

 makishima was the mastermind behind the many cases that the public safety bureau were investigating, including the one that led kougami shinya to become demoted to the position of enforcer. despite his murderous intent, his hue has always been pure white with a low crime coefficient count, thus making him immune to the dominator weapon possessed by the public safety bureau. as such, people like him are labeled as \"criminally asymptomatic.\"\
 \
 makishima used his resources to support various criminals as a means of uncovering humanity's repressed desires. eventually, this would lead to a scheme in which he sought to uncover the truth behind the sibyl system that governs japan. initiating his plot, he was confronted by kougami shinya at the upper floors of the building that contains the core of the sibyl system. though he was able to incapacitate kougami in a fistfight, he was apprehended by tsunemori akane in a surprise attack. held in custody, he is approached by joushuu kasei, in which she revealed the truth behind the sibyl system, including the fact that kasei merely acted as a shell that served as a proxy for the governing body of the sibyl system.  due to the sibyl system being run by the brains of the criminally asymptomatic, his past ally touma kouzoburou (who was integrated into the system) spoke through kasei, in which he proposed an offer to makishima to voluntarily contribute and become part of the governing system of sibyl. makishima refuses, however, wanting to remain as a player forever and ever in a game which he calls \"life.\" \
 \
 escaping the clutches of sibyl, makishima plotted to sabotage the food system supply as part of his plan to bring down the sibyl system and put society in a state of chaos. makishima's plot was foiled through the combined efforts of the public safety bureau and ex-enforcer kougami shinya, in which he is killed by kougami in the final episode of the series. during his final moments, makishima lamented his existence as a replaceable component of the society established by the sibyl system, in which he reveled in the notion that he at least served as an irreplaceable enemy for kougami shinya.\

 saiga is first introduced when shinya brings his new inspector, tsunemori akane, to see him. from pure observation and logical thinking, saiga was able to correctly deduce that akane couldn't swim, both her parents were still alive, and they were worried their only daughter wasn't finding a boyfriend, and they were against her joining the mwpsb, and lastly that akane's grandmother had treated her with great affection.\
 \
 shinya later asks to see the list of past course attendees that he keeps, saying it was a personal request, and not an order from the mwpsb; should it have been an order, saiga would have turned it down. shinya goes on to explain that he's looking for the 'worst criminal since the creation of the sibyl system'. as shinya tells of the many traits of such man, saiga then goes to ask on what is charisma.\
 \
 for shinya's answer, he is given 20 points. he then begins explaining that charisma has three elements: the nature of a hero or a prophet, an ability to make one feel good when around them, and the intelligence to eloquently talk of all sorts of things. saiga then asks which of the elements does the man in question have. shinya replies that he has all of them\
 \
 saiga later helps shinya by helping him discover shogo's motives. when they find out his next plan of action, shinya leaves immediately, thanking his former mentor for his help. saiga tells him that the next time he gets a surprise hue check, he will be arrested because of his actions.\

 mikasa is eren's adoptive sister and mutual childhood friend of armin. mikasa shares an unbreakable bond with eren following events in their past, and rushes to protect him whenever he is in danger. mikasa possesses impressive fighting skill and strength even as a child.\
 \
 as a teen, mikasa is considered a genius among all the army trainees and is incredibly skilled at combat and agility. she constantly worries for eren's well-being and lives to protect him.\
 \
 when mikasa was younger, her parents were murdered and she was taken hostage to be sold into slavery. eren managed to find her and killed two of the three kidnappers by catching them off guard, despite only being a child. the third kidnapper discovered the scene and began strangling eren while holding him in the air. mikasa, trembling, grabbed eren's knife from the floor. in that split second, mikasa came to terms with the cruelty of the world, gaining perfect control of her own body and using that strength to kill the kidnapper in a single strike through the heart&mdash;killing him to save eren.\
 \
 in the aftermath of this trauma, mikasa asked dr. jeager where she could possibly go from here. she was cold and had no place left to call home. eren gave mikasa his red scarf and dr. jeager welcomed her into their family. because of eren's heroics and this gesture, she feels she owes her life to the jeagers. she continues to wear eren's scarf from that day into adulthood, and they are inseparable.\

 eren's best friend, he is physically weak yet emotionally strong. even though lacking in actual combat skills, armin is a genius in theoretical courses and can make plans even under extreme pressure. even so, armin keeps on thinking that he is weak. he himself does not notice the things he does for eren and mikasa, and believes himself to be completely incompetent and hates himself for having to rely on eren and mikasa.\

 eren is shingeki no kyojin's protagonist. his adoptive sister, mikasa, notes on numerous occasions that he acts on impulse without thinking things through, and she often pulls/carries/throws him when he starts fighting with others to protect him from himself. along with mikasa, he tends to spend his free time with their mutual friend, armin.\
 \
 his father is a doctor (whom is well respected by hannes and potentially many more) whilst his mother is a housewife.\
 \
 when eren was a child, he saved mikasa from being sold off when a visit to her home with his father. three men&mdash;killers of her parents&mdash;were in her house, and he killed two of them&mdash;one by slitting his throat and the other by charging at with a quickly assembled spear. mikasa herself killed the third man after eren urged her to fight whilst the man strangled eren. after this, he gave mikasa his scarf and eren's father adopted mikasa into their family.\
 \
 later, when the colossal titan broke through wall maria the debris from this attack scattered and hurtled towards his home. he could only watch on as his mother&mdash;trapped under the rubble of their house&mdash;was eaten by a titan. this event lit the fire of revenge within eren that he would kill every giant and not live a life cowering in fear.\
 \
 sometime after this&mdash;before the time skip that jumped a few years ahead, to when he became a soldier&mdash;his father injected him with something. it's unknown what at this time but it turns out, because of the injection, eren can utilize the ability to transform into a titan himself (which explains how his limbs were able to regenerate) with side effects of a high fever and massive stamina drain.\
 eren has a special titan power called the \"co-ordinates\", by which he can direct abnormal titans to attack elsewhere.\

 marco bott is a member of the 104th trainees squad, and graduated as the 7th ranked trainee in his class. he was assigned to fight the titans after the breach of wall rose, and given command of his own squad. \
 \
 <b>personality</b>\
 marco is an idealistic person, valuing the good of the group above his own interests as well as understanding and coping with his own shortcomings and limitations. the others respected him greatly, and considered him to be a natural leader suited to his dreams of joining the military police. unlike those who join the military police for safety and privileges, his reasons of joining it were genuinely faithful. he was shown to be an excellent judge of others, recognizing jean's potential as a leader and encouraging him to believe in himself. he was also shown to have a talent for preserving order among the other trainees, whether resolving arguments or keeping them calm during battle.\
 \
 <b>story</b>\
 marco is first introduced during the initiation of new recruits, and is intimidated by their instructor after expressing his desire to join the military police. he later attempts to maintain order when the recruits question eren about the attack on wall maria, hiding the others when their questions become too upsetting. during his time as a trainee, he befriends jean kirschtein and the two were often seen together. he seems to have been one of the only people to recognize jean's potential, encouraging him to embrace his natural abilities as a leader.\
 \
 after the colossal titan attacked trost, marco was assigned command of the 19th trainee squad and ordered to support the vanguard forces. he was eventually among the trainees stranded when the retreat order was given, without enough gas to scale the wall and escape trost. when mikasa and jean rally the others into charging headquarters, which had become surrounded by titans, marco is quick to join them. inside the station, he became vital in armin's plan to reclaim the overun supply room and leads the main group. armed with rifles, the recruits acted as bait and lure the seven titans occupying the room into position. marco managed to maintain order in the group, keeping everyone calm until they could fire and blind the attacking titans.\
 \
 he is later seen among the regrouped forces, attempting to keep order when people like dazz give into their fear. marco did his best to comfort them and keep morale high, even when they were ordered to return to trost. he joined the other recruits up on the wall, acting as bait to distract the titans from the main operation involving eren yeager. later, he was among the recruits that head into the city to battle the titans. there, he helped to rescue jean when his gear malfunctioned and would eventually join the others in battling the titans while eren sealed the hole in wall rose. \
 \
 he dies during the battle for trost. his death serves to illustrate the grim reality of life for the soldiers, as even the most talented can meet an ignoble end while facing the titans. \

 annie is a titan-shifter, and as such, it was revealed that she is the female titan who killed most of the scouting legion members during their 57th expedition. annie was part of a group of titan-shifters that initially aimed to wipe out the humans inhabiting the walls until the revelation of eren's capability to transform into a titan forced them to change their plans on capturing him instead. she is also the culprit behind the killings of the two captive titans that hange was researching.\
 \
 as the female titan, she had attempted to kidnap eren on numerous occasions, with the two even engaging in hand-to-hand combat in their titan forms. she aims to capture eren with the supposed goal of bringing him \"somewhere.\" when she was suspected by armin to be the female titan, the scouting legion had set up a trap to capture and interrogate her, though she was able to see through their plot which resulted in her attempting to escape. mikasa and eren manage to stop her from escaping, and when the soldiers tried to bring her out of her titan form, reminded of her father, she wrapped herself inside a hard crystal thus making the soldiers unable to obtain any information from her.\
 \
 though she is affiliated with bertolt and reiner, she tends to isolate herself from her fellow titan-shifters. despite her callousness and brutality in physical combat, she has shown genuine concern and respect towards her past classmates, notably eren and armin. despite her seeming disinterest toward her own combat skills, eren has deduced that she has a great fondness for it, as evidenced by her showing interest in further teaching him her techniques. as the female titan, she has the unique ability to generate a hard crystalline substance to protect/cover specific parts of her body.\

 in my neighbour totoro, the house the main characters move into is full of susuwatari, which are rationalized as makkuro kurosuke (pitch-black blackie), an optical illusion caused by moving quickly from light into darkness. later, the family drives the susuwatari out of the house, as the home that was once abandoned is now inhabited. they would move to another abandoned area. \
 \
 in spirited away, the protagonist sen (chihiro) befriends a number of them by helping them carry coal. sen is told that if these susuwatari aren't given a job to do, they turn back into soot. another character, lin, feeds the susuwatari much like farmers feed chickens, throwing handfuls of the japanese candy kompeito onto the ground for them to eat. \

 jet is skilled with handguns, typically carrying a pre-2004 walther p99, as well as the use of the netgun. he is good with hand to hand combat as well. unlike spike, jet tends to use more raw muscle than technique. he is also a great mechanic and pilot. aside from the converted interplanetary fishing trawler vessel bebop, jet flies a smaller ship called hammerhead. the hammerhead appears to be a modified (jet added larger engines and fuel tanks) salvage-craft that uses a mechanical arm equipped with a harpoon as its main weapon, which is somewhat analogous to his own mechanical arm. both the hammerhead and the bebop are able to land on water, and have a fishing theme, most likely because ganymede's surface is mostly covered with water (it is later revealed that the bebop was originally a fishing ship that jet \"customized\" with larger engines).\
 \
 during the series, it is revealed that jet once lived with a woman named alisa, who left him because he was too controlling. later they meet up again when alisa's new boyfriend rhint is wanted for murder. jet then ends up in a situation somewhat similar to that of vicious, where he must hunt down a woman who broke his heart, and her lover.\
 \
 in a later episode, another vicious/spike parallel is set up when jet finds out that it was his old partner fad who betrayed him (though in jet's case, there was no love affair involved). fad arranged for jet's death in a setup, but he survived with only a missing arm and a scar on his face. it is worth noting that jet managed to face the demons of his past and let them go, in contrast to spike, who was killed when he confronted his. this is likely due to the contrast in the two approaches to the past. while spike hid and fled from his past, jet tracked it down and confronted it.\

 spike spiegel is a tall and lean 27-year-old bounty hunter born on mars. the inspiration for spike is found in martial artist bruce lee who uses the martial arts style of jeet kune do as depicted in session 8, \"waltz for venus\". he has fluffy, dark green hair (which is inspired by yusaku matsuda's) and reddish brown eyes, one of which is artificial and lighter than the other. he is usually dressed in a blue leisure suit, with a yellow shirt and lupin iii inspired boots. a flashback in session 6 revealed it was his fully functioning right eye which was surgically replaced by the cybernetic one (although spike himself may not have conscious recollection of the procedure since he claims to have lost his natural eye in an \"accident\"). one theory is that his natural eye may have been lost during the pre-series massacre in which he supposedly \"died\". the purpose of this cybernetic eye is never explicitly stated, though it apparently gives him exceptional hand-eye coordination - particularly with firearms (spike's gun of choice is a jericho 941, as seen throughout the series). in the first episode, when facing a bounty-head using red eye, spike mocks him, calling his moves \"too slow\". at first, this seems like posturing on spike's part, but even with his senses and reflexes accelerated to superhuman levels by the drug, the bounty cannot even touch spike. a recurring device throughout the entire show is a closeup on spike's fully-natural left eye before dissolving to a flashback of his life as part of the syndicate. as said by spike himself in the last episode, his right eye \"only sees the present\" and his left eye \"only sees the past.\" spike often has a bent cigarette between his lips, sometimes despite rain or \"no smoking\" signs.\

 one of the members of the bounty hunting crew in the anime series cowboy bebop. often seen with a cigarette and in a revealing outfit complete with bright yellow hot pants and a matching, revealing top, black suspenders, white boots, and a long-sleeved red shirt worn normally through the sleeves, not to mention her signature headband, she is unusually attractive, sporting a bob of violet hair, green eyes, fair skin, and a voluptuous body. although appearing to be no more than her 23 years alive suggests, faye is actually upwards of 74-years-old, having been put into cryogenic freeze after a space shuttle accident. during the course of the series (set in 2071), faye manages to cross paths with spike and jet twice before she finally makes herself at home aboard their ship the second time, much to the consternation and disapproval of the two men, both of whom have their own reservations about women in general. faye herself is brash, egotistical, and quite lazy, despite taking plenty of time to pamper and care for her own appearance. faye has also been placed under arrest several times in the series and spends much time in handcuffs on the ship. she, at times, expects the boys to take care of bounties for her, while she sits by idly to reap the benefits and eat all their food, another source of conflict.\
 \
 seemingly little more than a thorn in her partners&rsquo; sides, faye is actually a well-rounded member of the team. she can handle herself exceptionally well for a woman of her slight appearance, displaying at least once in the series (in \"cowboy funk\") that she packs quite a mean punch. adept at flying, faye has stood her ground just as well as spike has in an aerial dogfight in her ship red tail, at times even against spike in an aerial dogfight. she also excels with guns, and is first seen in the series completely disabling a ship with a heckler & koch mp5, though she is immediately apprehended afterward. in the movie, she is seen with the same gun, in addition to her normal companion: a glock 30. where faye really shines, however, is with her mouth. she has an almost unstoppable attitude, and even her sometimes innocent smile can be seen as dangerous. sarcastic and presumptuous, she rarely appears weak or in need of support. she brags and takes care of herself, never trusting others, cheating and lying her way from one day to the next.\
 \
  she is a woman who is skilled at getting what she wants; however, her indomitable exterior hides a more delicate interior. upon awakening from her 54-year cryogenic sleep, not only was she saddled with a massive amount of debt that she had no means to pay, but she was also diagnosed with total amnesia, a stranger in a mysterious world that she was not a part of and did not understand, surrounded by people who claimed to be helping her but were only there to take advantage of her naivet&eacute;. the surname \"valentine\" was merely a name given to her by the doctor who woke her; the circumstances of her accident, her previous life, and even her real name all remain a mystery, and are only gradually revealed as the series progresses. it has been hinted that she came from singapore on earth, and was the daughter of a very wealthy family, as the city's famous merlion statue features prominently in scenes of her childhood, and that memories and a film from her childhood showed her living in a large mansion. in an early episode, she states that she is descended from roma people, but she may well have been lying. utterly betrayed by someone she thought she could trust after waking, faye found herself burdened with even more money to pay, and the situation resulted in the hardening of her personality to an extreme degree. she even says in session 11: &ldquo;we deceive or we are deceived&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;nothing good ever happened to me when i trusted others.&rdquo; \
 throughout the series, though she retains her sarcastic demeanor and unpleasant nature up until the very end, it is easy to see her grow as a character. she learns to value her comrades, coming back to the bebop when she realizes that it is the only home that she has left, naming it as the &ldquo;only place i could return to&rdquo;. she grows to understand the disadvantages of being a loner, and that even though her \"family\" is somewhat dysfunctional it is still a place where she will always belong.\

 her full name is largely a secret, which has prompted many to bet money and guess what her initials stand for. however, none have succeeded in winning the stack of money she's gained from numerous incorrect guesses. she is also known as the \"heavy metal queen,\" for her deep love of heavy metal music, which she considers \"very soothing.\" able to adapt to various situations, her philosophy is, \"when in rome, do as the romans do.\" considering her disdain against bounty hunters, it is believed that her husband, ural terpsichore, was killed, while pursuing a bountyhead. her first name is briefly mentioned, when spike sees her pocket watch. however, he knows her last name, due to the popularity and memory of her late husband.\

 kamina is a young man from jiiha village who dreams of leaving the village and go to the surface, which he saw as a kid. he's very passionate about his goals, expressing his wishes through energetic speeches, which seems to affect all those who hear him. he convinces simon to help him with his plan to drill through the roof of the village and get to the world above, but the plan failed and he was put in prison. he left the village shortly thereafter with the help of simon and a young girl named yoko, as a result of fighting a gunmen, who broke into the village from the surface.\
 \
 after he, simon, and yoko break through, they meet many enemies and friends as they go, to the point of building up a resistance force, the gurren brigade to fight in their war against the beastmen empire who hunt on human beings who live on surface, and becoming their leader.\
 kamina gets fatally injured during the battle to capture the enemy&rsquo;s moving fortresses belonging to one of the four divine generals, thymilph. heavily wounded kamina combines with simon to form gurren lagann and defeats the beastman general with his signature move: \"giga drill break.\" kamina dies in the cockpit, leaving simon with this: \"don't believe in the kamina who you believe in. don't believe in the simon that i believe in. believe in the simon who believes in himself.\"\
 \
 kamina is buried in the battlefield where he died, his nodachi stabbed into the ground and his cloak tied to its sheath. \
 he helps wake team dai-gurren from the fake universe they were put into by the anti-spirals. \

 yoko is a girl from jeeha's neighboring village littner, who had been chasing the gunmen which entered jeeha village. she wields an extensive range of firearms which include a long range sniper rifle (which she uses most frequently) modeled after the barrett m82 and hand guns (which can be assumed is used for mid-range or close combat) and has previous experience fighting gunmen. although she is of the same age group as simon, she is mature and one of the more rational members of the group.\
 \
 despite always badmouthing kamina for his reckless behavior, it did not take long for her to confess her feelings to him, which he returns. she was also simon's love interest, until simon discovered that she was in love with kamina. he seems to have given up on her since meeting nia. in episode 13 she proceeds to tell simon that she was in love with kamina in which simon replied that he already knew. after the war, yoko decided to not take part in the administration of kamina city and decided to become a school teacher for the first new children born on the surface, but not before asking simon to take care of nia. \
 \
 after the war with the anti-spiral, yoko became principal of the school she once taught at.\

 simon is the protagonist of the story, a short and un-intimidating fourteen year old boy at the beginning of this tale. he was born in jiiha village and was raised by his parents until the age of seven, when his parents were killed in an underground avalanche caused by an earthquake. their deaths traumatized simon to the point of both hating and fearing life underground, and likely played a role in developing his relationship with kamina. ironically, simon's role in his community was to dig more tunnels and caverns to expand jiiha village deeper underground.\
 \
 though valued as a skilled digger, simon was ignored by the adults of his village and snubbed by the girls, who considered him disgusting. along with his fear of earthquakes, simon developed low self-esteem and had many cowardly tendencies. his only friend and role model growing up was kamina, a brash and eccentric older boy who had an obsession with escaping the underground world for the surface, which he visited as a child with his father. simon was slowly \"recruited\" into team gurren along with several other boys, and lead by kamina made several attempts to reach the surface over several years. during one attempt, a sudden earthquake trapped team gurren within a chamber and cut off the supply of oxygen. simon began to panic, but after inspiration from kamina he managed to dig all of the team gurren members out of danger. yoko would later recall that kamina himself was terrified during this incident, but he hid his fear from simon knowing simon was the only one capable of rescuing his gang.\
 \
 one day during the digging of a new tunnel, simon discovers a small drill-shaped object that periodically glows. later that day, he unearths a large \"face\" in the ground, which he shows to yoko and kamina after jiiha village is attacked by a large gunmen. the face is revealed to be a miniature gunmen, and the object simon dug up the key to starting it up. with the aid of this mech, which kamina names \"lagann\", simon destroys the large gunmen attacking jiiha and rises to the surface world.\

 a mysterious young girl found sleeping in a capsule in the middle of a dump site by simon. she had no prior contact with humans, except her father, who is also the sovereign of the beastmen, the spiral king. she is very curious, pure and innocent, due to growing up sheltered in a peaceful environment, away from all the battles occurring in the outside world. despite early misgivings, she is quickly accepted by team dai-gurren, much to the (initial) irking of yoko. \
 \
 during her journey, she develops a strong empathy towards simon and grows to be his fianc&eacute;.\
 \
 after her encounters with divine generals adiane and guame, she comes to an understanding of the reason simon found her outside the palace, being forsaken by her father after she started attaining her own will and self-consciousness, as he considered his offspring merely toys to play with as dolls, and decides to join the team dai-gurren as a cook (even though her cooking is unbearable to anybody but simon) in order to confront her father. in the final battle with lord genome, she boards lagann with simon and aids him in the destruction of lord genome.\
 \
 seven years after teppelin's fall, nia and simon are engaged, but soon after she is overtaken by the anti-spiral race to become a digital messenger.\
 after the defeat of the anti-spirals she and simon get married, though she begins to fade away before the shocked crowd but an unsurprised simon. she tells simon she loves him and he answers back saying that he will never forget her \"till the end of the universe\". nia corrects him, stating it will never end and that's what they'd worked so hard for. she smiles as simon says he loves her and she fades away.\

 \
 viral is a recurring enemy and later an important ally to team dai-gurren in the japanese anime tengen toppa gurren-lagann. he is a shark-type beastman with feline genetics. his appearance is more humanoid than most other beastmen, except for his cat-like eyes, shark-like teeth, and large clawed paws in place of hands. he is skilled in piloting gunmen, as well as in unarmed combat. while hunting for food, he attacks kamina when he found, running into his gunmen enki after yoko intervene in a ensuing fight between the two. he manages to overcome simon and kamina's attacks, but leaves before the fight ends. the next day, viral returns to execute his mission as member of the human execution squad, facing kamina and simon again; this time however, viral is defeated by the newly formed gurren-lagann, barraging it missiles in order to conceal his escape, swearing revenge on kamina for his humiliation when he took enki's helmet in the fight.\
 \
 viral later returns alongside supreme general thymilph and the dai-gunzan to crush team gurren with the upgraded enkidu, but is severely injured in the battle, which resulted in the dai-gurren's capture and the death of his superior. he tries to obtain another chance to fight by trying to join supreme general adiane's side, in spite of her treating him like garbage as she blames him for thymilph's demise. still, viral saved adiane from harm during a fight with team dai-gurren, by stopping the dai-gurren's foot from crushing her. after adiane's death by the dai-gurren's attack and being the only survivor of the dai-gunkai, viral curses the gurren-lagann and swears to bring pain and punishment to those who killed his two superiors and robbing him of a honor.\
 \
 under supreme general cytomander's command, viral took part on the aerial attack on the dai-gurren. his battle with the gurren-lagann, piloted by simon and yoko, extended to the control room of cytomander's aerial fortress, the dai-gunten. there, he learned of kamina's death, and discovered that he not only lost to a human, but to a child as well, challenging simon to a one-on-one duel in their mecha. but the battle was interrupted by cytomander, who took yoko hostage, and ordered viral to destroy the defenseless gurren-lagann. however, viral disobeyed as he knew this outcome would not make him regain his lost pride and honor. for this action, cytomander asked the spiral king's permission to execute him for treason, but viral's last request was hearing from the king himself of what is the true nature of human race. thus, lord genome dispenses cytomander and conducts viral to a room where he reveals the truth behind the beastmen's existance before making him immortal. viral's last effort against the gurren-lagann was in the spiral king's throne room, where he believed he could finally obtain his vengeance after becoming immortal, but was soundly defeated. lord genome revealed that the reason he gave viral immortality was not to fight against simon, as none without \"spiral energy\" could stand against his power, but to make of him as an eternal witness of his triumph against team dai-gurren.\
 \
 after lord genome's defeat and the fall of teppelin, viral's whereabouts were unknown, until he was sighted causing an uproar with his gunmen, and demanding simon to fight him, but rossiu stopped simon from going after him and sent their guraparl force instead. gimmy and darry together managed to take down viral's enkidudu and put him under custody. when questioned by simon about why he continues to fight even after the war ended, viral stated that his intention was to protect a human settlement which refused to leave the underground. simon would eventually discover that rossiu was forcing people out of their villages without his consent, in order to count them to find out how close mankind's population was from reaching the one million danger level, stated by lord genome. viral is sent to the rikone prison and reappears in the end of episode 19, when he re-encounters simon, who was imprisoned there, awaiting for his death sentence to be carried on. both end up locked in individual cells after a brawl, but after simon is rescued by yoko, viral is also released by him and accepts his proposal to join team dai-gurren against the anti-spirals, as the gurren's pilot. this position is cemented after the battle, when simon declares him the gurren's official pilot in a meeting with the team members; this title goes uncontested.\
 \
 in episode 26, we discover that viral's greatest desire is to have a family, however, this will always be impossible, since beastmen cannot reproduce. despite being a beastman, he obtains a core drill when broken free from the anti-spiral's illusion, even though beastmen should not be able to produce spiral energy. in the epilogue, viral is seen commanding the chouginga dai-gurren, as a representative for earth, in the upcoming spiral peace conference; due to his immortality, his appearance stays the same, in spite of the fact that 20 years have passed.\
 viral's name comes directly from the word \"viral,\" tying in with the beastmen's genetics theme, but there are other theories about his name's origin. one is the fact that it can also be an anagram for \"rival,\" referring to his constant rivalry with kamina, which transfered to simon throughout the series until near the end. another possible theory comes from the nikopol trilogy of comic books written by enki bilal, as enki is the name of viral's first gunmen and \"bilal,\" pronounced in japanese, sounds like \"viral.\" supporting this theory is viral's theme song, which is titled \"nikopol,\" on the anime's soundtrack.\
 \
 the name of viral's gunmen may be tied to the sumerian diety enki, though it is much more likely that there is a deliberate connection between his second gunmen, enkidu, and the character of enkidu from the epic of gilgamesh. the myth consists of enkidu (\"enki's creation\"), a man of the wild who seeks to challenge king gilgamesh, a mighty warrior, but who later befriends him and assists him in in his travels.\

 mugen is rude, vulgar, and often thinks highly of himself. much of his past is a mystery. he was born on the ryukyu islands, never knew his parents, and was a former pirate. after an incident forced him to fake his death, he became a vagabond. but things changed after he met jin and fuu. though very rough around the edges, he has a mutual understanding with jin and cares for fuu more than he lets out, considering he usually ends up going after her whenever she gets kidnapped. \
 \
 his fighting style is described as a \"champloo\", which means \"mix\". it combines all sorts of martial arts, unorthodox swordplay and break dancing. he relies on instinct and reflex to surprise his enemies. \
 \
 his style of clothing represents the future, whereas jin's represents the past. his black hair is usually untidy, and is similar in shape to an afro. \

 mugen is rude, vulgar, and often thinks highly of himself. much of his past is a mystery. he was born on the ryukyu islands, never knew his parents, and was a former pirate. after an incident forced him to fake his death, he became a vagabond. but things changed after he met jin and fuu. though very rough around the edges, he has a mutual understanding with jin and cares for fuu more than he lets out, considering he usually ends up going after her whenever she gets kidnapped. \
 \
 his fighting style is described as a \"champloo\", which means \"mix\". it combines all sorts of martial arts, unorthodox swordplay and break dancing. he relies on instinct and reflex to surprise his enemies. \
 \
 his style of clothing represents the future, whereas jin's represents the past. his black hair is usually untidy, and is similar in shape to an afro. \

 sakura is the only female ninja of team 7. when she first meets naruto she is physically weak and has an immense crush on sasuke. she dislikes naruto as well.the only thing she's good at is her brain as the smartest girl in ninja academy her excellent chakra control, out of that she could be categorized as a kunoichi. in the first part of the chuunin exam she is easily able to answer the questions, but in the second part she is unable to defeat the sound ninja attacking sasuke and naruto. she makes a pledge to become a better ninja and a better person. to prove her commitment she cuts her long hair with a kunai.\
 \
 in the third part of the chuunin exam she goes up against ino yamanaka, her former friend but current rival for sasuke's affections. the two defeat each other simultaneously. this turns their relationship in a rivalry between friends.\
 \
 after the time skip she is now a chuunin having been trained by tsunade for the past two years. she is now a medic ninja of considerable skill, enough skill to possibly defeat tsunade one day. it is shown when she is able to do a complicated surgery to extract poisons out of kankuro body and make an antidote of the new type poison that sasori used,which the suna gakure medical-nin unable to do.\
 \
 during the time skip she's also matured in personality, she become calmer compare when she were genin, but she still has her temper especially when naruto is fooling around in front of her she will beat him up into a bloody pulp. \
 \
 sakura has grown not only as a medical-nin, now she's also a capable fighter. she can manage to destroy the ground with her fist using her inhuman strength, a chakra control technique she learned from tsunade, and she is also able to beat sasori from akatsuki together with elder chiyo from sunagakure.  additionally she is a genjutsu type, and though she has yet to use that potential she does show an almost complete immunity to being trapped in an illusion.\

 quote: (from obito) \"a shinobi who violates the rules is scum, but a shinobi who abandons their friends is worse than scum\".\
 \
 major background spoilerslike his father, sakumo hatake whose skills have been compared to that of the legendary ninja, kakashi is considered a genius shinobi, graduating from the ninja academy at age 5 and achieving the rank of chunin at 6. a few years after these accomplishments, kakashi's father was disgraced by the village for abandoning a mission in favor of saving his comrades, which cost the land of fire dearly. deeply ashamed and ostracized even by those he had saved, sakumo committed seppuku, leaving kakashi to bear witness to the event. after his father's suicide, kakashi began to adhere strictly to the rules of the shinobi &ndash; in particular the rule dictating that the success of the mission must come before the well being of one's teammates, causing him to become arrogant, humorless, and by-the-book.\
 \
 during an attempt to save rin, kakashi lost his left eye as a result of taking an enemy ninja's attack for obito. to protect kakashi in return, obito managed to awaken his sharingan and killed their assailant. soon after saving rin, a rockfall technique was triggered and a rock struck kakashi on his blind side. he would have been buried beneath the rocks had obito not pushed kakashi out of the way, getting the right side of his body almost completely crushed in the process. shortly before he died, obito had rin (a medical ninja) implant his sharingan eye in kakashi's damaged eye socket as a gift. as his first act with his new eye, kakashi avenged obito by killing the enemy ninja with his now-perfected chidori technique, bringing the kakashi of today into being.\
 \
 years later kakashi would become a member of the konohagakure anbu where he served as a squad leader. during this time, he had several kōhai, named yugao uzuki and tenzo, and recognized the latter as the most successful of his kōhai. it is unknown when or why he left anbu, but he still wears iron guards on his gloves, a characteristic of anbu uniforms.\
 \
 obito's death profoundly changed kakashi, and kakashi adopted many of obito's traits. one such trait was obito's concept of teamwork, which is most clearly seen in the way kakashi tests newly-graduated students hoping to become a squad under him. he uses the bell test to test his students, which requires the three students to get the two bells he keeps on his person. only those who get a bell get to pass, which would be difficult even with teamwork, as at least one ninja would fail regardless. however, the rule is only a ruse; the point of the test is to foster teamwork and to teach the students that teamwork is more important than the rules. team 7 is the only team to realize this, and as such becomes the only team kakashi passes into genin-status. kakashi also inherits obito's chronic tardiness, due primarily to losing track of time during his frequent visits to konoha's memorial site, where obito's name is engraved. ironically, this very habit is one that kakashi was often annoyed at obito about. obito was supposedly late due to random good deeds. kakashi's personal life appears to be as much of a mystery as the face behind the mask he has worn for most of his ninja career. he has no living family, or at least none he cares to acknowledge, and he's confirmed that everyone he loves is already dead.\
 kakashi has an ongoing, albeit slightly one-sided, rivalry with might guy, with guy constantly proclaiming that kakashi is his rival, and considering his and kakashi's subordinates rivals. kakashi, however, seems indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys guy to no end. guy randomly challenges kakashi to contests of skill, and kakashi has acquired a record of 49 wins and 50 losses in doing so. given that the contests that make up this figure are so varied (ranging from rock, paper, scissors to sumo-wrestling), this is not much of an achievement on guy's part. nevertheless, guy is proud of his record.\
 \
 though he evasively says that he has \"many hobbies\" when asked about himself, he is commonly seen reading of \"icha icha paradise\" (イチャイチャパラダイス, icha icha paradaisu, literally \"make out paradise\"), an adult and probably pornographic novel authored by jiraiya that is a runaway bestseller in the naruto world. kakashi most prominently reads it while training and speaking with his team, and is later seen reading the second known volume in the series, \"icha icha violence\" (イチャイチャバイオレンス, icha icha baiorensu, literally \"make out violence\"). in part ii naruto gives him the new \"icha icha tactics\" (イチャイチャタクティクス, icha icha takutikusu, literally \"make out tactics\").\
 \
 kakashi's sharingan eye gives him a significant advantage in battle, as he can copy enemy techniques and use them as his own, as well as track and predict his opponent's movements flawlessly. because it is a transplanted eye, his sharingan eye is always active. while this would not be much of a problem for an uchiha, his non-uchiha blood causes it to use much more chakra than it should. because of this, he covers it with his headband and only utilizes it in the most dangerous battles. kakashi's use of the sharingan is as good as that of itachi uchiha, though the aforementioned handicaps brought about by the nature of his eye make him somewhat weaker in comparison. in part ii kakashi is able to develop his own mangekyo sharingan. with his variant he is able to manipulate space-time to conduct long range attacks, and in its two uses has been capable of severing another's arms and otherwise sending things to different dimensions. much like the standard sharingan, the mangekyo sharingan tires kakashi considerably, and after using it only three times he was hospitalized for a week due to its chakra usage.\
 \
 with his sharingan kakashi has been able to copy more than one thousand jutsu, giving him the nickname \"copy ninja kakashi\". as a result, kakashi's arsenal most prominently features ninjutsu abilities and has led to him becoming a specialist in the field. many of the jutsu he has been seen copying in the series are water-based attacks, though most of these he only uses against the person he copies them from. he does, however, use water release: water encampment wall on occasion as a way to block attacks. he less frequently uses other elemental attacks such as fire release: great fireball technique to attack opponents or earth release: inner decapitation technique (土遁・心中斬首の術, doton: shinjū zanshu no jutsu, viz \"groundhog technique decapitation\", english tv \"headhunter jutsu\") to pull opponents below ground and immobilize them. he can also create shadow clones, though because he lacks naruto's chakra reserves, he exercises the ability with caution, rarely creating more than one at a time.\
 \
 while kakashi specializes in the use of ninjutsu due to his sharingan he is fairly adept with other jutsu types, though his use of them is rarely seen. demonic illusion: hell viewing technique (魔幻・奈烙見の術, magen: narakumi no jutsu) causes his opponent to see what they would find a horrifying vision, keeping them preoccupied until they can overcome the illusion. a thousand years of pain (death in english dub) (千年殺し, sennen goroshi) consists of kakashi forcefully plunging his index and middle fingers into an opponent's rectum. while only capable of launching the opponent humorous distances in typical uses, the fingers can be replaced with kunai attached with exploding tags to actually do damage to the person one is attacking.\
 \
 when he was younger kakashi was taught how to use the rasengan by the fourth hokage. because the rasengan is meant to have the user's chakra nature mixed with it, kakashi attempted to add his lightning-based chakra to it, though was ultimately unsuccessful. in time he instead created the chidori, his only original jutsu. after the jutsu's initial creation kakashi was unable to use the chidori to its full potential as the sheer speed of the attack left his normal eyes unable to see any form of an enemy counterattack. after acquiring the sharingan, however, he was able to overcome this shortcoming. through repeated use and increased proficiency with it, kakashi's chidori has been upgraded and renamed to the lightning blade due to him having cut through a bolt of lightning with it.\

 \
 when sasuke was young, his clan was murdered by his older brother, itachi. with his parents and family now gone, his brother spared him and left him to survive by himself. he told sasuke to hate him. sasuke tried to forget about the past by applying himself in the ninja academy and fitting in with the rest of the leaf village.\
 \
 after his fight with naruto, he believes he's been wasting his time \"playing ninja\" with the people of the leaf village. his new goal is to get stronger so he can avenge his clan by killing itachi and then restore the uchiha clan.\
 \
 as a wielder of the sharingan (the kekkei genkai of the uchiha clan), he learns to use chidori and has a vast knowledge of the various fire jutsus. the curse seal which orichimaru gives him during the chuunin exam, at first, enhanced his power but at the risk of killing him. now he can use it of his own free will.\
 \
 claiming at first that he doesn't need any friends, he is forced to contradict himself when he sees that either naruto or sakura are in danger. remembering this type of sasuke is what brings motivation to naruto. sasuke openly admitted to naruto that he was his closest friend.\
 \
 <b>appearance</b>\
 sasuke has black hair with a blue tint that lengthens as the story goes with onyx eyes and has lighter skin than his brother itachi. like many other members of his clan, his hair hangs over both sides of his face to roughly his cheeks. in his curse seal form, he has grey skin with wings on his back that resemble giant webbed hands. he also has hair similar to madara uchiha except in a greyish-blue color.\
 \
 at the beginning of part i, sasuke's clothing made up a blue, short-sleeved shirt with a raised collar and the uchiha crest on the back and white shorts. an interesting thing is that during part i the uchiha symbol on his back gets smaller each time he changes his outfit. in the last stage of the chunin exams, he wore a black, one pieced version of this outfit but eventually went back to his original clothes.\
 \
 in part ii, sasuke has grown noticeably taller (almost eye height with itachi) and slightly more muscular. wears a white long sleeved shirt that's open at the torso with a smaller version of the uchiha crest on his collar. he wears black pants with a blue cloth hanging from his half way up his stomach to his knees. he also wears a purple rope belt (japanese name: shimenawa) tied in a bow fashion found on many sound ninja, only the bow is in a different style and is tied in the front instead of the back. he also will at points remove his shirt and hang it from his belt around his waist to give his wings in curse seal level 2 room to move (also without transforming).\
 \
 sasuke, even though claiming to be emotionless, wouldn't kill unless it was necessary until madara uchiha twisted his personality even further by telling him that his brother, itachi, after he had killed him, was ordered to kill their clan and suffer for the sake of the village. after knowing this, he suddenly turns far colder and seeks for revenge on konoha. however, after he had calmed down, he noticed how confused he really was and revived orochimaru to request answers to his questions about his clan, konoha, and what shinobi and the hokage really are. he's currently helping naruto and the others put an end to the war and announced that he plans to become the next hokage. but when the the war concluded, sasuke made it clear that his goal was to become a new kind of hokage, a kind of hokage that wants to banish darkness from the ninja world and to do so he believes all the old kages should be killed. he also wants to conclude things with naruto and so he invites him to one final concluding battle. the battle ends with both naruto and sasuke losing one of their hands. while both lie on the ground he finally accepts naruto's feelings and stops his path of revenge to return to the village.\
 in chapter 700, it is shown that he has a daughter with sakura.\

 born in konohagakure, a ninja village hidden in the leaves, naruto uzumaki was destined for greatness. when born, a powerful nine-tailed demon fox attacked his village. with a wave of its tail, the demon fox could raise tsunamis and shatter mountains. in a valiant attempt to save the village from destruction, the fourth hokage, the leader of the hidden leaf village, sealed the demon fox within naruto's newborn body. this was his final act, for the battle with the fox cost him his life.\
 \
 despite the fourth hokage's dying wish that naruto be viewed as a hero for serving as the container for the demon (a <i>jinchuuriki</i>) the adult villagers of konoha harbored a fierce hatred for him, with many believing that naruto and the demon were one and the same. cast aside as an inhuman monster, naruto was outcast and ostracized by the villagers for reasons he could not understand. the children his age could only ever follow their parents' example; and they too came to harbor a fierce hatred for naruto.\
 \
 naruto eventually came to accept that he would live and die alone, and his external response was to perform harmless pranks on the village. coy, raffish and full of life, naruto soon came to display a somewhat unexpected determination to succeed and be accepted by others. upon being assigned to \"team seven\" as a genin-ranked ninja, his true potential soon became outwardly apparent.\
 \
 vowing to become hokage one day and using his will to never give in, naruto saves the village from invading forces and earns his acceptance. eventually, naruto learns to harness the power of the demon fox sealed inside him to perform acts of strength far beyond what any other human is capable of.\
 \
 in all, naruto is an admirable character whose sheer determination to succeed despite the odds, earns him respect and devotion from his fellow villagers.\
 \
 he becomes the hero of his village, after defeating the six pains all by himself.\
 he then befriends the nine-tails inside of him and control its powers. in time, he also becomes more dependable considering the shinobi alliance completely relies and respects his power, even the reanimated previous hokages.\
 he later receives chakra from all the nine tailed beasts and then gains the power of the sage of the six paths, along with sasuke.\
 at the end of the manga, he is married to hinata with two children, boruto and himawari, and becomes the seventh hokage.\

 after saving his partner dosu from rock lee's lotus attack, he brutally fought off sakura who attempted to prevent him from killing sasuke. after the helpless sakura lay beaten on the ground, he and his team had to fight team asuma. during the fight, sasuke finally regained consciousness, and asked sakura who had injured her. zaku took the credit, and sasuke proceeded to dislocate and greatly injure zaku's shoulders. he was the only sound ninja to fight sasuke, as the others retreated. during his fight with shino aburame in the preliminary exams, he overcame the injuries to his shoulders and was able to use his arms to defend himself against shino. due to his cockiness, he attempted to attack both shino and his approaching army of kekai insects, not noticing that the chakra-eating bugs had already filled the tubes in his arms, preventing him from attacking and even more brutally crippling and preventing him from doing any damage in the future (in the manga, his right arm was blown off due to the kikai bugs shino used to fill up zaku's air tubes, and the left was kept intact but halfway sliced. in the anime both of his arms are left intact, but have numerous holes in them, achieving the same, albeit less gruesome, result). dosu says he would avenge him (or rather, his severed arms), but failed to do so.\

 zaku, along with kin tsuchi, is later murdered as a sacrifice for orochimaru's impure world resurrection for the first and second hokages against the third hokage. \

 shino aburame is character who has a fascination with bugs; most of his spare time is spent watching bugs, he often makes analogies to bugs when talking. in addition to liking bugs, shino is characterized by his emotionless, solitary, and collected way of doing things. he speaks very bluntly and never allows emotion to interfere with his judgment, sometimes offending people in doing so. despite his odd personality and occasionally arguing with kiba, shino has a very strong sense of connection with his teammates and allies.\
 \
 shino alongside hinata hyuga and kiba inuzuka is in team 8 which is led by kurenai yuuhi.\
 \
 in battle, shino is able to take great use of his intelligence, being able to use his analytical and observational skills to make shrewd judgments with pinpoint reasoning. as a member of the aburame clan, shino was infused at birth with a special breed of insects that feed on chakra. in return for becoming a living hive, the insects attack opponents, usually while he distracts them, and carry out other tasks as he commands. shino has found a number of uses for these bugs, and as such has devised a number of jutsu that utilize them for varying purposes, such as creating copies of himself or using bugs for defensive purposes.\

 choji akimichi is a childhood friend of shikamaru nara. together with him ino yamanaka, and asuma sarutobi they make team 10. choji has a love for food, his favorite being korean barbecue, general snacks and sweets, and basically anything that is edible. his nigh-constant hunger is a constant annoyance for his teammates, as sating himself often comes before other necessities such as stealth and teamwork. because of this, his teammates often use food against him, such as offering him food as a reward for accomplishing a task or simply using his favorite foods as a form of blackmail. despite his open display for his love of food, choji is very sensitive about his size and becomes highly agitated when somebody calls him \"fat.\" once called \"fat,\" choji's resolve to fight is elevated to new levels and he becomes much more hostile to his opponents than he would otherwise. just as they use food against him, choji's teammates use this personality trait against him as well. should choji be reluctant to fight, one of them need only comment on his size to spur him into combat form.\
 \
 as an akimichi, choji's style of combat focuses on increasing his size. at the series' start he uses multi-size technique to serve this purpose, reshaping him into a large, round form.\

 deidara is a missing-nin from iwagakure. before joining akatsuki, deidara was as a terrorist bomber for hire, where his work attracted the attention of pain. pain sent other akatsuki members to recruit deidara, though he refused. after being defeated by itachi uchiha, however, deidara was forced to join the organization. deidara maintained a deep loathing for itachi from that point further and became determined to defeat him, even training one of his eyes to overcome itachi's signature ability: genjutsu. deidara was partnered with sasori upon joining the organization, whose artistic ability and insight deidara admired. after sasori's death deidara is paired with tobi whom he treats as a disciple. despite tobi's habit of accidentally angering deidara, deidara takes great care to keep tobi out of harm's way and even dedicates his final moments to apologizing to him.\
 \
 in battle, deidara uses special mouths in the palm of each hand to create exploding clay, chakra-infused clay that explodes on command. he commonly uses the command \"katsu\" to trigger it. the blast strength of his creations is determined by how much chakra he adds to them. his clay can take on any size or form, ranging from microscopic in size to copies of himself as tall as a skyscraper. deidara refers to his creations as art, believing the most beautiful thing about them to be their detonation. his admiration for his art is such that he believes it can't be defeated, leading to overconfidence in battle. depending on the complexity or potency of one of his works, deidara applies it a designation from anywhere between \"c1\" to \"c4\", the former being the most basic and the latter being his strongest and most complex attack. for his final act, deidara also has a mouth on his chest that, once provided with clay, turns him into a living bomb that destroys everything in a 10 kilometer radius.\

 during the nine-tailed demon fox's attack on konoha, he fought alongside hiruzen against the beast. he and hiruzen also later witnessed the nine-tails being sealed inside of naruto uzumaki.\
 \
 enma was fiercely loyal to hiruzen, although he didn't always approve of his actions. he kept reminding hiruzen about actions in regards to orochimaru. enma would have preferred to have killed him the first time. enma was seen in a flashback of orochimaru's defection, urging hiruzen to kill orochimaru, which explains his current attitude. he is also quick to anger, as shown when he tried to break orochimaru's neck, right after orochimaru injured hiruzen.\
 \
 enma is capable of using transformation: adamantine staff, which allows him to turn into a large, extendable staff that is as hard as adamantine yet as sharp as a sword, though despite it hardness, enma has said that orochimaru's kusanagi sword can cut him. he can also produce various body parts, such as eyes or arms, from the staff. additionally, enma can still move on his own in the staff form, allowing him to return to hiruzen. enma can even clone himself in his staff form, turning him into any number of smaller staffs that he uses for adamantine prison wall, a move that can even protect against hashirama senju's wood release techniques.\
 outside of this, he himself is physically very strong, easily handling hashirama and tobirama senju in brief hand-to-hand combat when they tried to keep him from transforming. he also shows knowledge of various jutsu and their effects or drawbacks.\

 sasame planned on giving naruto, jiraiya and sakura tea with a drug to make them fall asleep, and handing them over to kamikiri in exchange for being allowed to see arashi. however, the plan failed when kamikiri revealed that he wanted to kill them instead of capturing them, and sasame was knocked unconscious when she protested against that. naruto, sakura, and jiraiya revealed that they had only pretended to go along with her plan, and defeated the three fūma ninja. almost as soon as she regained consciousness, sasame tried to commit suicide over having failed, but jiraiya stopped her and convinced her to show them to the hideout.\
 despite being ordered to stay behind, sasame follows naruto into the hideout and saves him from a slowly flooding room by opening the trapdoor, allowing him to catch up with sakura. she later saves naruto from kagerō (who was disguised as kabuto yakushi) by giving sakura a seal that will free them from her attack. when she met arashi, she saw what had become of her cousin she decided to help naruto and sakura in defeating him. after the incident, she decided to join forces with hanzaki and the remaining members of the fūma clan to rebuild the clan's former glory.\

 gaara was introduced in the series in chuunin exams arc, as a violent shinobi from konoha's allied country, the wind country. he came to konoha with his siblings temari and kankuro, and with his mentor baki, to participate in chuunin exams.\
 \
 from the first look, he was shown as merciless and violent individual. due to his hard childhood, and lack of love, gaara grew up hating everybody around him, loving only himself. \
 \
 in fateful incident about 6 years before the main story time, he made himself a tattoo of japanese kanji letter \"ai,\" which stands for \"love.\" in gaara's case, that love was for himself, as he was \"demon loving only himself.\"\
 \
 gaara's point of view dramatically changed after a clash with naruto, who taught him the true meaning of loving others. since then, gaara always feels in debt to naruto, and tries to help him as much as he can.\
 \
 like naruto, gaara is a jinchuuriki who holds within him the one tailed beast, ichibi no shukaku. gaara also relates to naruto in that in his early years, gaara was often repelled by other children, and feared by suna's citizens due to the incredible power he possessed.\

 when haku was just a young child, his father discovered that his wife was part of an advanced bloodline. haku's father proceeded to kill his mother and then went after him. in haku's fright, he killed his father and fled his small village, believing himself to be a monster: a monster loved by no one.\
 \
 on one faithful day, haku looked up in the slums of the back alley to see a shinobi staring down at him, this shinobi was zabuza. haku then proclaimed, \"you have the same eyes as me\". zabuza realized that haku was one of the advanced bloodline limit carriers, and took the child under his wing. haku was raised by zabuza as \"a tool\" to be called upon when needed in exchange for his \"freedom\" from the slums. he learned how to use his unique abilities and eventually became a hunter-nin. when zabuza's plan to kill mizukage fails, haku fled the village along with zabuza to fulfill his job as a veritable \"a tool.\"\
 \
 haku's slender frame and delicate appearance enables him to disguise himself in various ways. in fact, while finding medicine to treat zabuza's wounds haku runs into naruto. naruto mistakenly believes haku is a girl. as we see in the ensuing brawls, it is not appearance that determines strength. rather, under that soft face we see that haku has an adroit knack for speed and jutsu skill. combined with his knowledge of the human body, haku can target his opponent's vital organs and kill them instantly using pinpoint accuracy. the main choice to attack these vital organs is with simple needles that are used by physicians in the battle field.\
 \
 haku's bloodline originates in the country of mist so it is no surprise that his jutsus are water based. his \"flying water needles\" is a technique whence he uses his chakra to create ice needles via water on the ground. furthermore, he uses his chakra to control the path of the needles and strike the enemy. his other technique, \"demonic ice mirrors\" uses water to create ice mirrors to surround the enemy. he then combines himself with the mirrors and uses the reflection to transport himself from mirror to mirror while attacking his enemy from all angles. his most incredible ability however, is the ability to do one-handed seals. this allows him to complete various tasks that are not capable of being accomplished without having a free hand.\
 \
 although haku is an exceptional fighter, he is a kind ninja who is saddened by unnecessary death. his fighting spirit comes from the will to protect his most \"precious person,\" because \"when a person has something precious to protect, that is when they can become truly strong.\"\
 \
 haku is later 'revived' by kabuto using impure world resurrection during the fourth shinobi world war.\

 kisame hoshigaki is a missing-nin from kirigakure and is partnered with itachi uchiha. he gets along considerably better with itachi than most akatsuki members do with their own partners, immediately doing as itachi asks of him and always looking out for itachi's well-being. his former country, the land of water, now seeks him out for plotting to overthrow its government and being involved in numerous assassinations. when he was still loyal to kirigakure, he was one of the seven swordsmen of the mist, a group of ninja that wield particularly large weapons in battle. kisame's weapon is called samehada, a scale-covered sword that shaves off skin instead of cutting and is capable of absorbing untold amounts of chakra. samehada only allows kisame to wield it; if anyone else tries to pick it up, spikes protrude from its handle and it returns to kisame's side. like other characters who have trained to be one of the seven swordsmen, kisame enjoys mutilating his opponents, as seen when he suggests cutting off naruto uzumaki's legs to make him easier to carry.\
 \
 kisame has a distinctive shark-like appearance, complete with pale blue skin, small white eyes, gill-like facial structures, and sharp triangular teeth. even his name, kisame, means \"demon shark\". his shark-like qualities carry over to the type of techniques he uses in battle, as he often shapes bodies of water into the forms of sharks that proceed to attack opponents. if there is no water source where he happens to be fighting, kisame can use water release: exploding water shockwave to create a lake's worth of water to be used for attacks. kisame is also noted to have a particularly large reserve of chakra; even when he fights at 30% power in one instance his chakra supply is compared to that of a nine-tailed demon fox-enhanced naruto uzumaki.\

 hyuuga hinata is the eldest daughter of the hyuga clan's main branch. \"hyuga\" (日向) means \"toward the sun\" while \"hinata\" is a pun, as it is another way to read this kanji and means \"a sunny place.\" hinata was trained by her father, hiashi hyuga, to become the clan's heiress, though in time he came to deem her a lost cause. believing her to be of lesser skill than her younger sister, hanabi hyuga, her father left hinata in kurenai yuhi's care once she was assigned to team 8, claiming he didn't care what happened to her. throughout her early time in team 8, hinata's lack of self-confidence and unwillingness to fight hamper her abilities. although she would train to improve her skills, she would immediately give up when faced with competition and failed every mission she was assigned as a result.\
 \
 in an attempt to change herself, hinata enters the chunin exams, where she is pit against her cousin, neji hyuga, in the exam's preliminary matches. neji is quick to ridicule hinata for her personality traits and attempts to convince her that she is a failure who will never be able to change herself, bringing her to tears. naruto uzumaki's encouragement, however, empowers her to fight her cousin despite repeatedly being struck down. although she is defeated, naruto's words have a lasting effect on hinata and she becomes more confident in her abilities, and even sticks up for herself by telling neji that he is the one who is attempting to fight against what cannot be changed. after recovering from her wounds, hinata continues training to prove herself to her father and naruto. her efforts are successful in both regards, as she is eventually able to acquire a better relationship with her father, who encourages her to continue working on improving herself. naruto has also come to hold her in a higher standing, and he tells her that while he had considered her timid and weird before, he now views her as a likable person.\
 \
 hinata has a long-standing crush on naruto, which has been present since their time in the academy. her feelings for him are rooted in his determination, confidence, and strength, all of which hinata lacks. with her affection for naruto, hinata is constantly willing to break away from her normal personality traits in order to help him. she also becomes more assertive for naruto, and also doesn't hesitate to defend him, even to himself. her feelings for naruto are one of the driving forces in her self-improvement, as she tries to gain strength in an attempt to both impress him and become like him. when they meet again in part ii, hinata is unable to bring herself to greet naruto and passes out when he comes to greet her, her feelings for him having apparently been amplified during his absence. despite this, she gradually becomes more comfortable around naruto, going from being unable to look him in the eye to being able to talk to him, and is able to work with him without difficulty when they are on missions together.\
 \
 as a member of the hyuga clan, hinata possesses the byakugan, which gives her an almost 360 field of vision. during the chunin exams, she displays the ability to focus the byakugan's sight, increasing the distance that her eyes can see. she also specializes in the gentle fist fighting style, which allows her to damage her opponent's chakra circulatory system and inner organs directly with even a slight tap. in her quest to get stronger, hinata creates a new ability during the anime's bikochu arc called protection of the eight trigrams sixty-four palms (守護八卦六十四掌, shugohakke rokujūyon shō), a combination of the hyuga clan's most powerful techniques. with it hinata emits streams of chakra from her palms to create extremely sharp blades that she can use to hit any target in her field of vision. due to the speed at which these blades move, the amount of control she has over them, as well as her ability to manipulate their size, hinata can use this technique to attack and defend simultaneously.\
 \
 sometime after the fourth shinobi war, she marries naruto and bears their two children, boruto and himawari.\

 neji hyuuga is a stoic member of might guy's team guy, consisting of himself, rock lee, and tenten. neji and lee have somewhat of a rivalry, much like that of guy and kakashi hatake. lee is determined to prove that a \"failure\" such as himself can defeat a \"genius\" such as neji. neji, however, doesn't seem to be interested in this goal of lee's, and lee doesn't seem to have made an effort to prove the point to neji. despite this apparent clashing of ideals between the two, neji seems to get along fairly well with tenten, with the latter often helping neji with his training. neji and tenten also tend to share opinions on lee and guy's overreactive behaviors, often wondering how they can train the way they do.\
 \
 as a member of the hyuga clan, neji has a byakugan, allowing him to see the chakra flow of others and block the flow upon contact with his gentle fist style. as a member of the clan's branch house, neji can never hope to be taught how to use the clan's most secret techniques by the clan's elders. despite this, neji has learned many of the clan's strongest techniques independently, even creating a few unique skills of his own. because of this, neji is known as a genius ninja and graduated from the academy as the #1 rookie.\
 \
 because his father, hizashi hyuga, was a member of a branch house of the hyuga clan, neji was born into the branch house. as a result, he was branded with the hyuga branch family seal at a young age so that the members of the main house could keep him in check. hizashi, believing neji to be denied his potential as a branch house member, openly resented the main house, causing neji to acquire the same feelings due to his father's influence. in time, neji's hatred for the main house would increase exponentially as result of hizashi being sacrificed to save the life of hiashi hyuga, hizashi's twin brother. neji believed that his father was forced to die for his twin brother. because of this, neji came to feel that fate was something decided at birth and that no matter what one does, people cannot escape their destiny. this idea would go on to shape neji's life, creating a deep hatred for the main house and all of its members. \
 \
 after the chunnin exams when neji fights naruto his both his great skill and potential are recognized by the clan leader, his uncle hiashi hyuuga, and is sought out by him to train with the main branch of the family to further enhance neji's skills. this helps ease some of the tensions between the two branches of the hyuuga clan.\

 hiashi hyuga is the head of the hyuga clan. he is the father of hinata and hanabi hyuga, twin brother of the late hizashi hyuga, and uncle of neji hyuga.\
 \
 as the father of hinata hyuga and the uncle of neji hyuga, hiashi has a significant role in the lives of his daughter and nephew.\
 \
 hiashi was born seconds before his twin brother hizashi hyuga, making him the head of hyuga clan. the fact that neji would never be able to succeed the clan, and that he would be marked with a curse mark so that he could be disciplined caused friction between the brothers.\
 \
 when his daughter, hinata, was kidnapped by a the head ninja of kumogakure no sato, who was acting as an ambassador to konoha at the time, he had no choice but to kill her kidnapper. the land of lightning overlooked the kidnapping, and they demanded a life for a life, asking hiashi surrender his life and be killed, or else a new wave of warfare between the hidden leaf and cloud villages. while hiashi planned on accepting the punishment, his brother insisted on taking his place, saying that while he hated the main family, he wanted to save his brother and decide his own destiny. he asked hiashi to tell neji about his decision and his reasons before leaving to be killed.\
 \
 hiashi's general personality is very stern and strict, as he assigns both his daughters arduous training, rarely complimenting their performance. this is especially true with hinata; when she was assigned to kurenai yuhi, he told her that he was unconcerned about the possibility that she would die, saying that the hyuga clan had no use for a weak successor.\

 inari's outlook is changed after he meets naruto uzumaki, who also had a horrible past, but learned to deal with it. naruto's unwillingness to quit and concern for others helped inari to realize the power of will over fate, and that no risk is too great to protect something precious. he therefore grabbed his crossbow and rallied the townspeople, who proceeded to rise up against gato's men. he also attempted to save his mother from the thugs, who would have killed him, had it not been for naruto. along with naruto and kakashi hatake, they were able to drive away gato's thugs. \

 kiba inuzuka  is one of the main supporting characters of the series. he is a chūnin-level shinobi of konohagakure and a member of the inuzuka dog-user clan, as well as a member of the chūnin team, team kurenai, along with shino aburame and hinata hyūga. kiba is usually seen with and fights in collaboration with his partner, akamaru. \
 \
 kiba is often short-tempered and impulsive (in stark contrast to his teammates shino and hinata), and can be prone to making mistakes when he becomes agitated in battle. the fact that he enjoys combat, as well as a habit of showing a joyful smile when facing a particularly strong opponent, indicates that he is willing to risk his life for a mission, and is rather bloodthirsty. he deeply cares for akamaru, and is willing to do whatever is necessary to protect him. and, despite his rather gruff attitude, many of kiba's actions reveal that he is very close to his older sister, hana inuzuka, and remains fiercely loyal to the inuzuka clan. \
 \
 kiba's personality and jutsu style are further enhanced by his wild appearance. while clearly human, he has several physical traits more akin to animals. like the rest of his clan, he has messy brown hair, sharp black eyes with vertical slit-like pupils, pronounced canine teeth, and nails that he can change into claws. he also has the distinct red fang markings of the inuzuka clan on his cheeks. \

 kankurou is initially characterized by his apparent dislike for children, as seen when he is noticeably irritated while in the presence of someone younger than him. though, this seems to have gone away as time passed by. this is most evident when he is with gaara, who kankurou is forced to put up with due to the fear his younger brother imposes on him. despite their apparent differences, gaara and kankurou become very close over the timeskip as gaara begins to confide in kankurou and shares his dreams of wanting to risk his life to protect sunagakure. as such, kankurou has become very protective of gaara, willing to challenge anyone who puts gaara down in his presence. when gaara is captured by akatsuki, kankurou rushes to his brother's aid in an attempt to save him and even after being nearly killed as a result he does not falter in his resolve to find gaara.\

 kidomaru is the spider-like member of the sound four; he possesses four extra arms, has the ability to make webs, and even possesses a third eye. kidomaru's webbing is made of a special type of liquid that is created by infusing body liquid with chakra, making it as strong as steel. kidomaru can create a stronger, golden webbing called spider sticky gold that hardens upon contact with oxygen to metal-like quality. because of the solid nature of this webbing, kidomaru can shape it into armor or weapons to aid him in battle.\

 kimimaro was the fifth member of the sound four, thus temporarily changing their group name to the sound five. the original four were forced to accept him against their will, as kimimaro's combat abilities exceeded all of their skills combined. he was the sole survivor of the kaguya clan, who could manipulate their bodies' skeletal frame. the kaguya clan was wiped out when they attacked kirigakure, seemingly for no reason other than the desire to kill. having underestimated their opponent's defenses, they were slaughtered to the last man, with only kimimaro surviving.\
 \
 note: though some fans believe that his full name was kimimaro kaguya, the second databook only said his name as kimimaro.\
 \
 kimimaro was referred to by orochimaru as the most powerful member of the clan, having \"abilities that even that war-loving clan feared\". because of this, he was locked away in a cage for most of his life, only released occasionally when needed to fight other clans.\
 \
 like many of orochimaru's closest followers, kimimaro was branded with a cursed seal, which gives him greater power at the expense of his free will. when in his level 2 form, his appearance is similar to that of a dinosaur, with dark gray skin, six large bone spines on the back of his chest, and a long bone spiked tail. he also possesses a great deal of control over his cursed seal, as he is able to control its spread throughout his body without fully activating it. kimimaro was apparently friends with jugo at one point, and his control over his cursed seal impressed the latter. karin claims that kimimaro was the only one who could stop jugo without getting hurt.\
 \
 kimimaro succumbed to his disease and died in the middle of his fight with gaara during the sasuke retrieval arc, moments before he was about to deliver the finishing blow to gaara and lee.\

 dosu is a genin from the sound village, and leader of his squad. they were under the direct supervision of orochimaru during the chunin exams. dosu uses a sound amplifying device on his left arm, called a melody arm, to increase the vibrations he makes when he hits something, causing damage to the opponents ears and messes up their sense of balance. he is the only member of his squad to advance to the second stage in the chunin exams after defeating choji akimichi. \
 he showed dedication to orochimaru's task of killing sasuke uchiha, but later became disillusioned after learning that orochimaru had given sasuke a cursed seal. realising that he and his team were actually pawns used to determine sasuke's worth, dosu's outlook changed as he lost any and all loyalty towards orochimaru and vowed to kill sasuke for the purpose of undermining orochimaru. because of this, he would attempt to take down gaara prior to the actual match to lessen the obstacles beforehand, a rather rash decision that cost dosu his life.\

 the demon fox's attacks were seemingly random, the only apparent reason for its appearances being its attraction to places of human malice. it attacked konohagakure twelve years before the start of the series. none of the ninja of the village were able to defeat it until the fourth hokage, minato namikaze, arrived to deal with it. minato sacrificed his life to seal the fox into the body of his newborn son, naruto uzumaki, with the dead demon consuming seal. rather than completely seal off the fox's great power, however, minato only sealed away a portion of it, giving naruto access to the rest for unknown reasons. prior to performing the seal minato gave a key to jiraiya to either strengthen or weaken the seal should the need arise. the seal naturally becomes weaker as the years pass, and in the event that it is broken the demon fox will be released; however, the bond between naruto and kyuubi, and the bond between jinchuuriki (host) and tailed beast in general, is of a such character that if the seal is broken, naruto will die immediately thereafter. and if naruto dies, and the seal is not broken, kyuubi will die with him. therefore kyuubi uses some of its chakra to enhance naruto's healing abilities and will sometimes \"take over\" (lend naruto its chakra without him asking for it) in order to keep him alive.\

 he is the leader of team guy, consisting of rock lee, neji hyuga, and tenten.\

 guy, and by extension lee, lives his life by his own \"my rules\" philosophy, which involves setting tougher self-imposed penalties for failure so something good comes of it. for example, he vowed to walk 500 laps around konoha on his hands if he lost a contest with kakashi, and proceeded to do so upon losing, even though people eventually stopped paying attention. he also doesn't hesitate to do things he doesn't enjoy or that others might find embarrassing if it means his own self-improvement, as seen with his belief that one cannot dislike food regardless of its ingredients or taste. in addition, guy values his youth to a great degree and dislikes the idea that he may not be as young as he once was. to help remedy this problem he spends large amounts of time with his younger teammates, hoping to acquire some of their youthful properties. likewise, he often refers to himself as \"konoha's prideful green beast\".\
 \
 guy is the self-proclaimed rival of kakashi hatake. kakashi, however, is indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys guy to no end. kakashi also seems to have a habit of unintentionally ignoring guy when guy is lecturing him, which usually results in guy asking himselif why kakashi \"has to act so cool\". guy randomly challenges kakashi to contests of skill, and has acquired a record of 50 wins and 49 losses in doing so.\

 anko mitarashi is the proctor for the second exam of the chuunin selection exams and leader of the infiltration and reconnaissance party.\
 \
 anko was once the student of orochimaru. later she, along with nine others, were branded with orochimaru's first ten samples of the cursed seal of heaven. of the ten, anko was the only one to survive, establishing the one-in-ten chance of surviving the cursed seal. orochimaru supposedly rejected anko as a subordinate, believing she did not have the lust for power or vengeance needed to fuel the cursed seal. orochimaru lost interest in her, though he believed there was some value in letting her live. in the anime, after learning of her past, she was glad to discover that she wasn't tossed away like trash as she first had thought by orochimaru, but chose to leave orochimaru herself.\
 \
 anko is easygoing, tomboyish, playful, stubborn, and sometimes hyperactive, making her very similar to naruto uzumaki in many ways. despite portraying several \"naruto-like\" habits, she has shown to be very knowledgeable and studious. \
 \
 however, she is also shown to have a bloodthirsty (in a literal sense) side, as shown when she scratched naruto's face with a kunai, and licked away his blood. this probably comes from her time with orochimaru. she regularly makes sure to have at least basic knowledge of the landscape for which her next mission will take place.\
 \
 as shown in flashbacks during the land of sea arc, anko greatly admired orochimaru while under his tutelage, seeing him as a role model and was inspired to be more like him. after being branded by orochimaru with the curse seal, anko became enraged and carried a deep loathing for her former teacher. from there on, anko continues to search for orochimaru in hopes of taking him down, feeling that it is her duty as his former subordinate to stop him, even at the cost of her life.\

 minato namikaze was the yondaime hokage of konohagakure and the man responsible for sealing the nine-tailed demon fox inside naruto uzumaki when he was born. doing so cost him his life, and before dying he asked that the villagers not see naruto as the monster within him, instead wanting him to be viewed as a hero, a request ignored by the villagers. \"namikaze\" translates literally as \"wave wind.\" \"minato\" translates as \"harbor\" or \"port.\"\
 \
 minato shares a number of traits with naruto, namely in appearance and attitude. such comparisons are common throughout the first part of the series, and in the second as well. the second part of the series reveals that naruto is his son, hence the comparisons, born to kushina uzumaki. in his youth minato, along with two other unknown genin, was a student of jiraiya. prior to becoming hokage, he was also the sensei of kakashi hatake, obito uchiha, and rin nohara.\
 minato is said to be one of the greatest ninja konoha has ever produced, with natural talent that had not been seen in many years. he specializes in using the hiraishin no jutsu, a technique the second hokage, tobirama created, which essentially allowed him to teleport to any location with the use of a special seal. by attaching the seal to a kunai or an enemy, minato could teleport to the location of the seal unnoticed, allowing him to wipe out nearby opponents almost instantly. this ability led to his title as \"konoha's yellow flash,\" and it caused him to be seen as so dangerous that a flee-on-sight order was given in regards to him during the third ninja war. he also created the rasengan, a technique that does not rely on hand seals but instead uses a concentration of spinning chakra in one's palm that causes immense damage to its victim on contact. later in the series it is revealed that technique is actually incomplete. minato had planned to add his own nature manipulation training to the rasengan, making it even more powerful, but could not manage to prior to his death.\
 \
 later during the war he is resurrected by orochimaru with edo tensei alongside all the deceased hokage on sasuke's demand. after sasuke chooses to protect the village, he goes and joins the battlefield along with his fellow hokage to help the allied shinobi forces in their fight with the juubi.\

 \
 shikamaru is an extremely unenthusiastic person, and as such lives his life avoiding work. this is partly due to him seeking paths of least resistance, as he often chooses to do things he would otherwise not do if people nag him enough. in his free time he typically takes naps, watches clouds, and plays strategy games such as shogi and go. when put into a situation where he potentially needs to put effort into something, he attempts to try to find a way to avoid it such as forfeiting a battle or by pretending to be preoccupied with something else. in the instances where he can not avoid these situations, shikamaru tends to remark \"how troublesome.\"\
 \
 despite his lazy tendencies, shikamaru is extremely intelligent. his teacher, asuma, found shikamaru to have an iq of over 200, and learned that shikamaru's poor grades were a result of him finding lifting a pencil to be too much work for him. nevertheless, shikamaru works very well with his teammates, as their fathers were teamed together in their youth. of his teammates, shikamaru is closest with chouji, who repays shikamaru's confidence in him with unyielding loyalty. shikamaru also has a strong bond with asuma, often spending time with him playing strategy games. after asuma's death, he even vows to protect asuma and kurenai's unborn child for his teacher's sake. shikamaru has stated that he will make the child his apprentice someday.\

 one of shikamaru's more distinctive characteristics is that he finds all women to be bossy and \"a pain.\" contrary to this opinion, he has expressed a notably mature interest in marriage and raising a family with a son and daughter. ironically, shikamaru seems to constantly find himself surrounded by the very same strong-willed and bossy women he dislikes. in addition to his own mother, and being surrounded by bossy females, he usually ends up fighting against such women. shikamaru has had a number of his appearances coincide with those of temari. when they make their part ii debut together, naruto uzumaki asks if they are on a date, though both shikamaru and temari state that this is not the case.\
 \
 when the need arises, shikamaru is quick to abandon his lazy nature and act appropriately to complete a mission or save his teammates. using his shadow imitation technique, the signature technique of his clan, he can capture the shadow of an opponent to either keep them immobilized or force them to mimic his movements. this ability causes shikamaru to frequently take the task of stalling enemies so that his comrades can get to safety or to simply buy time. although this role puts him in a dangerous position once he can no longer stall the opponent, shikamaru is willing to serve it, feeling that sacrificing his life to ensure the safety of his friends is worth it. he then considers every element that is relevant to the situation at hand and analyzes the information to its fullest, planning out a battle ten moves in advance and devising over a hundred strategies to use against an opponent. this combination of intelligence and dedication to his teammates causes shikamaru to become the first of the primary konoha genin to advance to the rank of chunin.\
 \
 once becoming a chunin, shikamaru's father teaches him how to use his shadow technique more effectively, by using it to choke an opponent. this more interactive capability with his shadow is put to great use over the timeskip, and by part ii shikamaru becomes proficient at using multiple shadow-based techniques at once. he is also able to manipulate his shadow to lift from the ground and either grab or throw weapons simply by utilizing an opponent's shadow for the same purpose. after he comes into the possession of asuma's brass knuckles, shikamaru learns to channel his shadow into them, using them to immobilize opponents by throwing them at an opponent's shadow to capture them and save himself the energy.\
 \
 shikamaru goes to the chunin exams without a particular objective, not caring if he becomes a chunin or not. in the finals he fights temari, and would've won, but he decided to forfeit. during the invasion of konoha, shikamaru helps naruto and sakura to find sasuke by staying behind and creating a diversionary ambush against the sound ninja who were pursuing them. even though he forfeited the match, he was still promoted to chunin, mostly because of his incredible way of thinking displayed throughout it. as a result of his early advance to the rank of chunin, shikamaru plays a considerably more active role in the plot than most members of the konoha 11, albeit more indirectly than the primary cast. his first assignment as a chunin is to assemble a team to retrieve sasuke uchiha, who has betrayed konoha in search for orochimaru to gain greater power. this forces shikamaru's team to defeat sasuke's escorts, the sound four. while his teammates defeat their enemies, sasuke is able to escape, despite their best efforts.\
 \
 in part ii, shikamaru is assigned to track down two members of akatsuki. while he and his team manage to find their targets with relative ease, akatsuki member hidan is able to kill asuma during the course of a battle. after asuma's funeral, shikamaru sets out with the surviving members of team 10 and kakashi to avenge their sensei. as his team deals with hidan's partner, shikamaru is able to defeat hidan in memory of asuma, and single-handedly weakens akatsuki by one member.\
 \
 in chapter 649 of the manga, shikamaru states that when naruto becomes the next hokage, naruto doesn't have a smart brother willing to be his adviser like the first hokage and there would be no better adviser for naruto other than him.\
 \
 years later, shikamaru married temari and have a son named shikadai.\

 when he is first seen, he is portrayed as a bit of an alcoholic, and at times uses some of shikamaru's catchphrases (\"what a drag\" in english, \"how troublesome\" in japanese). like his son, he thinks that women should be tender and sweet, but as his son says, his wife has him whipped. also like his son, he is a very lazy person, but he is also quite caring, and is ready to jump into action when needed. unlike his son, his resolve is much stronger, as even during the most depressing or dangerous of situations, he has shown to maintain great determination and understanding as shown from how he has repeatedly helped his son regain his sense of worth. he also seems to be very smart as he has defeated shikamaru in shogi. \
 \
 like his son, and the rest of his clan, shikaku uses a special secret clan type of jutsu, that utilizes the manipulation of shadows in various combatable ways. although he has only been seen in combat once, as the head of his respective clan, it is highly presumed that he has mastery of his clan's techniques. during orochimaru's invasion of konoha, shikaku perfectly used the shadow neck bind technique against three opponents at the same time. \
 \
 he has also shown on several occasions to be a very intelligent man, repeatedly giving insightly words of advise to his shikamaru, as well as repeatedly beating him in shoji, strongly hinting at having an intellect that surpasses his son's.  shikaku's intelligence and skill as a ninja, has also earned him the position of jonin commander - the highest-ranking position to which a normal shinobi can be promoted.\

 orochimaru is a major antagonist of naruto series. he is a missing ninja from konohagakure, who is recognised as one of the most powerful ninjas and known as one of the \"legendary sannin\" (legendary three ninja), which was a title that was given to him and his former team mates, jiraiya and tsunade, by hanzō during the second shinobi world war. his main goals are to capture uchiha sasuke as his new body to gain possession of the sharingan and to destroy konoha.\
 \
 <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>background</b></div>\
 \
 from his childhood days orochimaru was identified as a genius shinobi and a once-in-a-generation prodigy. his parents died when he was young and according to jiraiya, orochimaru's goals, which were quite alien to the ideals within the village, were associated with these painful memories.\
 \
 he was a student of the third hokage, who recognized orochimaru's natural talent and often told jiraiya to be more like orochimaru. the third was aware of a malice and a lust for power within orochimaru, but chose to pretend not to notice and hoped that he could quell this part of orochimaru's personality.\
 \
 orochimaru's desire for power grew as the years went by. one day while visiting his parents' grave he found the shedded skin of a white snake. as the third hokage explained, it was known to represent good forture and luck which inspired orochimaru. he began to study kinjutsu (forbidden techniques) and became obsessed with learning all ninjutsu that exists in the world.\
 \
 after leaving konoha, orochimaru joined an elite criminal organisation called akatsuki. what he did while he was a member of the organization is pretty much unknown. the only information that was revealed is that his partner was sasori and he made an attempt to take control of uchiha itachi's body to gain the possesion of the sharingan.\
 \
 \
 after a failed attempt to take over uchiha sasuke's body, he was absorbed by sasuke who didn't want to give himself up to a weakened orochimaru. during sasuke's later fight with itachi, as sasuke was too weak to suppress his chakra, he managed to escape and tried to take over his body once again, however was trapped in an inescapable dream-like realm by the legendary sword of totsuka used by uchiha itachi.\
 \
 he was resurrected by uchiha sasuke during the fourth shinobi war, who used anko's cursed seal and a piece of kabuto's flesh to bring him back. after his resurrection, he reabsorbed the chackra kabuto stole from him and revealed that he doesn't have enough power to take over sasuke's body and has no interest in the war.\

 konohamaru named after the village he lives in: konoha, is the grandson of the third hokage and by extension the nephew of asuma sarutobi. konohamaru usually hangs out with his two friends, udon and moegi. together, they call themselves the \"konohamaru corps\" (\"konohamaru ninja squad\" in the english dub). in part ii they are teamed together under the leadership of ebisu, konohamaru's former tutor.\
 \
 at the start of the series, konohamaru feels unacknowledged due to his status as the hokage's grandson. as such, he frequently attempts to defeat his grandfather in battle so that he can become hokage himself and earn the recognition he desires. once meeting naruto uzumaki, konohamaru realizes that he can't become hokage by simply attacking his grandfather and will need to train hard to accomplish this goal. to help him in this regard konohamaru begins to view naruto as a role model, acquiring his determination, fiery attitude, and unique way of ending sentences, \"kore\" (コレ, a laughing signal or appreciation), much like naruto's \"dattebayo!\"\
 \
 konohamaru's most obvious acquisition from naruto's influence is his perverted habits, specifically the perverted jutsu he uses. after their first meeting konohamaru becomes naruto's disciple in an attempt to learn the sexy technique and defeat his grandfather. after mastering the ability he begins to train to create his own perverted jutsu, and after learning the shadow clone technique in part ii he is able to create a smaller version of naruto's harem technique. he has named his variant the sexy: double knockout girls technique (おいろけ・女の子どうしの術, oiroke: onna no ko dōshi no jutsu), which transforms himself and his shadow clone into nude women in a suggestive embrace. because this jutsu is only effective against men, he also creates the sexy: double knockout guys technique (おいろけ・男の子どうしの術, oiroke: otoko no ko dōshi no jutsu) to turn into nude men in an equally suggestive embrace.\

 genma shiranui replaces hayate gekkou as examiner of the main matches of the chunin exams after hayate is killed. \"shiranui\" means \"phosphorescent light\". genma is often seen with a senbon in his mouth. he uses this as a weapon, spitting it out at the enemy to attack them (it can reach up to 60mph), or to deflect ranged weapon attacks. when the invasion of konoha begins, genma battles baki off-screen, presumably to a draw since both of them come out of the fight relatively unscathed. he later appears with raido namiashi to confront the sound four, who are forced to go level 2 of their cursed seals to defeat them. the sound four later comment that if it hadn't been for their cursed seals, genma and raido would have defeated them.\

 shizune is a jounin-level kunoichi of konohagakure. she serves as the fifth hokage's attendant as well as her long time companion. she was tsunade's apprentice, becoming a talented medical-nin under her tutelage. shizune remains quite close to tsunade, being one of the few people tsunade would trust with absolute certainty. she was also appointed the captain of the allied shinobi forces' logistical support and medical division.\
 \
 shizune is the niece of dan, the late lover of tsunade. some time after dan died, tsunade left konoha, and shizune went with her as her attendant and apprentice. the bond between tsunade and shizune is strong and, above all, shizune sees her purpose in life as caring for tsunade.\
 \
 unlike tsunade, she is level-headed, practical, and a rational thinker. as a result, she is the one who tends to stress over details, such as tsunade's tendency to gamble and to think with her heart. she often gets comically worked up over any irrational decision tsunade makes. shizune also looks after tonton, tsunade's pet pig.\
 \
 she's not the type to tire easily and is very energetic and efficient while acting in her capacity of hokage's assistant, often urging tsunade to finish the paperwork in order to avoid mountains of unsigned documents later on. she is often seen asking tsunade questions about what to do with the village and the shinobi on missions.\
 \
 shizune is noted to be a very talented medical ninja, in konoha rivaled only by tsunade herself and sakura haruno, another student of tsunade's. her training has blessed her with excellent chakra control, which is the primary reason she was assigned to lead the sealing of the three-tailed giant turtle. she demonstrated her great medical knowledge when she lead a group of medics in healing neji hyuuga, even though she had only recently returned to the village after many years of wandering the world with tsunade. this was again seen when she was put in charge of the autopsy konoha performed on the animal path that jiraiya had killed.\

 tayuya (多由也) is a  kunoichi of orochimaru's sound four. \
 \
 <b>personality</b>\
 tayuya is foul-mouthed towards most people, especially jirobo, calling him \"fatty\", as he criticized her over it. she didn't think much of shikamaru nara as a leader, but as a weak, useless rat, who ran away when she used her doki to attack him. of the sound four, tayuya was the only member to show a sense of morality, as she berated shikamaru for sacrificing his teammates to bring back one person who voluntarily left.\
 \
 <b>involvement in plot</b>\
 \
 invasion of konoha arc:\
 \
 tayuya made her first appearance with the rest of the sound four, erecting a barrier to keep others from interfering in orochimaru's fight with the third hokage. she later escorted orochimaru when he fled.\
 \
 sasuke retrieval arc:\
 \
 the sound four escorted sasuke uchiha when he decided to join sides with orochimaru. when team shikamaru caught up with the sound four, they managed to take the barrel sasuke was being carried in from her. while trying to take it back, she was confronted by kimimaro, who threatened to kill her if she didn't deal with some of the konoha ninja. she fought shikamaru, but was repeatedly outmatched by his superior intellect. when she started relying on brute strength, she was almost able to kill him, but temari arrived, and killed her first.\
 \
 \
 fourth shinobi world war: confrontation\
 \
 in the anime, tayuya was reincarnated by kabuto yakushi along with her sound four teammates during the fourth shinobi world war. she was able to fight against shikamaru again. despite losing even when her body was enhanced by her summoner, tayuya quickly reconstructed herself and cast the space&ndash;time technique formula: underworld turnover to teleport herself and shikamaru to another location where her comrades have brought their opponents to. they continue their battles with their enemies, switching opponents while shikamaru comes up with an analysis. tayuya reveals that even their defeats will not release the barrier. the sound four overwhelm the konoha shinobi with the hatred they hold for them. taking advantage of this, shikamaru continues to bait their hate to lure naruto to the barrier and break them free. tayuya and her comrades decide to fight against naruto, but were defeated before their souls return to the afterlife.\

 temari is the oldest child of the fourth kazekage, making her the older sister of gaara and kankuro. temari is generally overbearing, if not crude, toward those around her, often not being afraid to speak her mind. one of the few things shown to intimidate her is her younger brother gaara. she very rarely stays true to her normally tough, demanding attitude, when around the boy, due to the fear of gaara's wrath. temari does have a caring side, and is not above showing concern for others. she is often seen with shikamaru. temari is a keen analyst, and can easily deduce an opponent's strategies and weaknesses soon after a battle begins.  for actual combat she uses her giant iron fan that, in addition to serving as a makeshift club, can be used to glide upon in order to intimidate her foes.\
 \
 sometime after the fourth shinobi war, temari marries shikamaru and bears their son shikadai.\

 in battle she summons varying types of weapons from the scrolls she carries with her. in part i she has many scrolls that serve this purpose, but in part ii she has consolidated her arsenal into a single large scroll. the weapons predominately consist of steel projectiles and an assortment of close-combat weapons, though she is seen using a crossbow in the anime and even a spiked bomb in part ii.\

 but as fate would have it, mizuki shows up and pins iruka to the wooden shack behind him. mizuki then tells naruto the truth about his past, the fact that he is the demon fox. mizuki then attempts to kill both naruto and iruka, but luckily, naruto uses the skill he learned from the scroll, shadow clone jutsu, to create clones of himself which defeat mizuki easily.\
 \
 after that incident, mizuki was imprisoned in the konoha strict correctional facility. mizuki later on leads a prison revolt and sends the brothers, fuujin and raijin, to orochimaru. during his escape, mizuki remembers back to when orochimaru gave him a cursed seal after a mission in which he killed his comrade. he was defeated by naruto's rasengan.\

 tsunade is the granddaughter of the first hokage. she is one of the legendary sannin.\
 \
 after his failed invasion of konoha, orochimaru approaches tsunade to get her to heal his arms. while she initially refuses, orochimaru offers to revive dan and nawaki in exchange for healing his arms. intrigued, tsunade is left a week to consider the matter. once meeting uzumaki naruto, tsunade begins to remember the dreams of her two loved ones and how much they loved the village of konoha. while she longs to see them both again, tsunade ultimately is unable to bring herself to help orochimaru, his hopes of destroying konoha too strong to ignore. determined to protect the village her loved ones held dear until the end of their lives, tsunade battles with orochimaru and eventually defeats him. having accepted the title of fifth hokage, tsunade returns to konoha afterwards.\
 \
 since becoming hokage, tsunade has primarily acted as a source of assignments, and mobilizes konoha's forces when need be. in addition, tsunade plays a large role in healing the more severe injuries that befall upon those she sends on missions. at the end of part i, haruno sakura becomes tsunade's apprentice.\
 \
 tsunade's trademark ability is her inhuman strength, which is derived from her excellent chakra control. by storing chakra and releasing it at the point of contact, she can enhance her strength to the point where she can break through boulders with her bare hands.\
 \
 she is also an extremely talented medical-nin, and can heal wounds that most others would consider impossible. as a result of her chakra control and her medical abilities, tsunade has created a form of regeneration. so she really is near 50 years old, but looks like she were in her twenties.\

 \
 background:\
 itachi uchiha is a missing-nin from konohagakure, and a prominent member of akatsuki, partnered with kisame hoshigaki. he is sasuke uchiha's older brother. \
 \
 itachi is relatively popular among many fans of naruto, often having ranked in the top ten in shonen jump magazine's popularity polls since his introduction. he was first ranked in the third character popularity poll ranked in 11th place. he was ranked 9th place during the fourth popularity poll, and 6th place in the fifth popularity poll. during the sixth popularity poll, he again was ranked in 11th place. in the last poll, he was ranked in 5th place.\
 \
 itachi was born into the uchiha clan and was praised by all as the best of his generation - a genius above all others. even by the standards of the battle-adept uchiha clan, itachi's prowess far outshined all others. however, not even his family, friends, or teachers could understand him. when he was only 4, itachi had already witnessed countless lives lost due to the third great shinobi world war, which emotionally traumatized him and turned him into a pacifist. at age 7, he graduated from the ninja academy at the top of his class after only one year, mastered the sharingan at age 8, passed the chunin exams at age 10, and became anbu captain at age 13. according to madara uchiha, itachi also had a lover, whom he killed during the uchiha clan massacre.\
 \
 he was praised highly by his father, who saw the family's future in itachi, hence neglecting his other son - itachi's younger brother, sasuke. however, during this time itachi showed great affection towards his little brother, sasuke, and even encouraged his father to come to the academy when sasuke was enrolled, something their dad had otherwise forgotten, by saying that he would not go to an important mission, that would establish itachi a place in the anbu ranks, otherwise.\
 \
 when the uchiha began planning to overthrow konoha, itachi, as an anbu, was tasked with spying on the village. knowing that a coup d'etat would only lead to another ninja war, itachi chose to spy on the uchiha instead, passing on information to the third hokage and the other konoha elders. after this he began to act strangely, not attending the clan meetings, speaking out against the clan, and becoming the prime suspect for the murder of his best friend, shisui uchiha. the clan lost hope in itachi, and his father began shifting his focus to sasuke instead. meanwhile, the third's attempts to negotiate a bloodless end to hostilities between the two parties were proving ineffective, so, against the third's wishes, danzo and the konoha council ordered itachi to wipe out the uchiha.\
 \
 before the fateful night arrived, itachi discovered the existence of madara uchiha, who was attempting to rekindle the flames of war in konoha. in return for not attacking konoha, itachi offered to help madara claim vengeance against the uchiha for turning their backs on him decades earlier. madara agreed. itachi slaughtered his entire clan overnight, sparing only sasuke. sasuke's life was worth more than the village to itachi, and he could not follow through with the orders to kill him as well. instead, he made himself out as a villain, who had killed their innocent family only to test his abilities. by doing so, he wanted sasuke to take vengeance on him and become a hero to konoha, thus redeeming the uchiha name. he tortured sasuke with his mangekyo sharingan, and encouraged him to become strong enough to kill him and avenge their family. hoping that his beloved little brother would someday be powerful enough to kill him, itachi left the village as a traitor.\
 \
 knowing that konoha would still want to eliminate sasuke, itachi pleaded with the third hokage to keep sasuke safe. he also threatened danzo to not harm sasuke or risk him revealing everything he knew about konoha's secrets to enemy countries. sasuke's safety was therefore secured, and itachi returned to his original plan of becoming infamous for his slaughter of the uchiha. \
 \
 itachi joined akatsuki in order to keep an eye on the organization, along with madara uchiha, in case either ever acted against konoha, all the while planning for his death at sasuke's hands. while a member of akatsuki, itachi was approached by orochimaru, who tried to steal his body to gain the sharingan. itachi trapped him in a genjutsu and severed his left hand as punishment, forcing orochimaru to flee the organization. sometime after joining akatsuki, itachi later helped recruit deidara, orochimaru's replacement, by beating him in battle, after which deidara swore vengeance again.\
 personality:\
 ever since his first appearance, itachi had always been mysterious, and had acted as though he was hiding his true self. while flashbacks to his past showed that he was a compassionate brother and person, his later acts and claims made it seem that this was mostly just an act. but, surprisingly, he genuinely was the compassionate brother he had once claimed to be, although he hid this from the rest of the akatsuki to protect sasuke.\
 as a member of akatsuki, he possessed incredible self-control of his emotions. he constantly displayed an emotionless personality. he only showed surprise when opponents proved more powerful or skilled than he had expected, and even then he didn't lose his composure. he did not possess any arrogance, and fully justified any statements he made about his power, even complimenting his opponents at times on their abilities.\
 \
 in addition to being an extremely powerful ninja, itachi had equally impressive intelligence, and was shown to be very wise. he was exceedingly sharp and observant to any situation at hand, as he was rarely surprised or caught off guard. he also displayed great intuition, as he was almost never deceived and even then almost instantly realized the truth. despite his status as a wanted criminal, and having murdered a significant portion of his family, itachi took no enjoyment in violence or combat, instead preferring to avoid battle or, if this was not possible, end it as quickly as he could.\
 \
 itachi's only initial interest was in akatsuki's goals, and his only loyalties appeared to be to the organization and its members, seeming to put the organization's success and secrecy before everything else. as such, itachi got along with his partner, kisame, much better than most other akatsuki members did with their own partners. kisame appeared to have a deep loyalty to itachi, immediately doing as he instructed and constantly looking out for his well-being. itachi treated all of his fellow akatsuki members to this same, more respectful personality, although his courtesy was rarely returned by the other members.\
 \
 however, when he was in a genjutsu duel during his fight with sasuke, he cruelly claimed he'd only let sasuke live so that he could take sasuke's eyes and obtain his own eternal mangekyo sharingan, after which he then claimed the uchiha clan had been nothing but tainted and evil, since many members would kill their friends to gain the mangekyo sharingan, and would take another uchiha's eyes to make its power permanent. once the genjutsu was released, he called it his true self, implying his calm, emotionless personality was also a facade. this persona was later revealed to be only an act to ensure that he would die by sasuke's hands, his love for his younger brother being the fundamental aspect of his personality. \
 despite his status as an infamous shinobi, his appearance was not the most intimidating, apart from the intensity of his eyes. while living in konoha, he would regularly have a gentle and caring look in his eyes, especially directed towards his younger brother. after joining akatsuki, he would regularly have a stern look to them. he was a fairly tall shinobi, whose basic appearance was very much like the rest of his clan.\
 \
 he, like all members of his clan, possessed dark grey eyes, and also had black hair that hung near his cheeks to frame his face. he also had the addition of a long ponytail in the back of his hair (which he obscured with his akatsuki cloak after joining the organization). being brothers, itachi and sasuke had a similar appearance, but with subtle differences. itachi's hair color appeared slightly duller and with a softer flow to it, without the spiky style at the back. his skin was also slightly darker. itachi's most distinguishing characteristics were the long pronounced creases under his eyes.\
 \
 when he lived in konoha, his casual clothes would consist of a black shirt with a large uchiha clan symbol on the back of it, and black pants with a weapons pouch strapped to them. when on duty, he would wear the traditional anbu uniform, although he was never shown wearing a mask. as a member of akatsuki, he wore the traditional akatsuki cloak, and usually kept the center of it buttoned down. after his cloak was incinerated by sasuke's kirin during their fight in part ii, it was revealed that he still wore his casual clothes underneath it. like almost all members of akatsuki, he wore the headband of his home village, konoha, with a line gouged through it, to symbolize his broken ties with the village (although, secretly, he was actually still loyal to his village).\
 abilities:\
 since a young age, itachi's intellect and talent showed their brilliance in everything he did, as even his teachers said his progress hardly required any help. in the few battles he had been seen in since the start of the series, itachi was shown to be an incredibly powerful ninja, and easily one of the strongest in the naruto series, as demonstrated by his ability to easily defeat deidara, sasuke, kakashi hatake, kurenai yuhi and orochimaru (twice), who themselves are considered amongst the strongest ninjas in naruto. being a pacifist, itachi did not actively take part in battle, typically only acting in self-defense.\
 \
 sharingan:\
 being of the uchiha clan, and as noted by kakashi, itachi was a true successor of the sharingan eye. from a stationary position, he would study an opponent's movements with his sharingan and respond accordingly, often with a genjutsu. he could cast a genjutsu by merely pointing at or looking at someone, and could similarly turn an opponent's genjutsu against them with demonic illusion: mirror heaven and earth change. itachi had trained so much with his eyes that he had reached the stage where he could have his sharingan activated the entire time, with minimal drain on his chakra levels. \
 \
 mangekyo sharingan:\
 itachi possessed the mangekyo sharingan, which increased his already great power, and enabled him to use his most powerful techniques. with his left eye, he could use tsukuyomi, a genjutsu that traps an opponent's mind in an illusionary world, torturing them for what seems like days in a matter of seconds.with his right eye he could use amaterasu, a ninjutsu which allowed him to create a black flame that he could direct by moving his eye to burn through seemingly anything in its path, including fire itself. his final technique was susanoo, a technique that manifested itself as a spectral being, labelled as the \"raging god of battle\" in the databook. it wielded the totsuka sword, an ethereal sword with the ability to seal anything it pierces into the gourd that serves as its hilt, and yata's mirror, a shield that can reflect any attack. zetsu, a fellow akatsuki member, stated that itachi's mastery of the sharingan, combined with the legendary weapons of susanoo, made him invincible.\
 \
 despite his mastery of the mangekyo sharingan, itachi suffered greatly from its side effects. his eyesight would worsen after every activation of the mangekyo sharingan, and he would eventually go blind from its power, with his sharingan forever sealed away. itachi was so close to blindness that, by the time he activated susanoo in his final fight, both sharingan eyes had become almost blind, and had turned white. however, he was still able to perform his own fūinjutsu in his last moments.\

 iruka umino is an instructor at the ninja academy, characterized by the distinctive scar across his face that he has had since childhood. the name \"umino iruka\" can be taken as \"umi no iruka\" (\"sea dolphin\").\
 \
 twelve to thirteen years ago, the nine-tailed demon fox attacked konoha, killing many people. iruka's parents were still out fighting the fox and were killed. iruka was dragged back for protection by an unknown ninja but wanted to stay where he was. after it was over, everyone in the ninja academy made fun of him and made him feel just like naruto uzumaki. he was always near the k.i.a. (killed in action) stone monument where his parents were listed and always cried. the third hokage would watch him and tried to cheer iruka up. mizuki was a close friend of iruka back then and usually made him feel better, but he was just acting to get the hokage's approval.\
 \
 little is known about iruka's abilities, but he is clearly proficient in the basic ninjutsu and genjutsu, seen when he disguises himself as an enemy ninja and menaces team 7 as a pretest for the chunin exam. the anime filler episodes show iruka using sealed bomb square release (方爆法陣, fūbaku hojin), which consists of setting an array of exploding tags and, once the target has entered, setting the tags to detonate if the target moves. because this only applies to the target, meaning others can freely enter the array without harm, it is possible that iruka is skilled in this area.\

 kabuto yakushi is orochimaru's personal medic, assistant, and general right-hand man. kabuto was found as a young boy by a chief medical officer of the konoha medical unit squad. the officer brought kabuto with him back to konoha and raised him as a son. kabuto eventually began acting as a spy for numerous countries and organizations (such as akatsuki) before coming under the servitude of orochimaru. kabuto has since used his various former affiliations as a means to gather intelligence on orochimaru's behalf, such as entering the chunin exams as a konoha ninja to gather information on his fellow participants for orochimaru's use. despite his apparent loyalty to orochimaru, kabuto's true personality is difficult to discern; he frequently switches from a lighthearted and polite teenager to a twisted and sadistic maniac that enjoys playing mind games with his opponents. while he generally obeys orochimaru's orders, he is not above healing orochimaru's enemies or trying to strike up polite conversations with naruto uzumaki when they meet. orochimaru himself seems to have a hard time determining kabuto's thoughts, and has suggested that kabuto secretly works against him.\
 \
 kabuto is a talented ninja, being compared to kakashi hatake in ability on more than one occasion, as well as being shown capable of killing anbu members with relative ease. the bulk of kabuto's fighting ability lies in the medical jutsu taught to him by his adoptive father. these abilities have been further enhanced through his allegiance to orochimaru, as he has been able to experiment on others to increase his medical knowledge. as a result, kabuto is able to reactivate dead cells in a concentrated area and grow new ones. while he uses this ability in battle to immediately recover from attacks, it can also be used during his experiments to keep test subjects alive for much longer than is feasible. kabuto can even temporarily reanimate a corpse for use as an ally or a decoy. during his battle with tsunade, she remarks that his fighting and healing abilities surpass her own when she was his age. despite his talents, kabuto has always served others, a fate he is dissatisfied with. as such, after orochimaru's defeat, kabuto integrates his master's remains into his body as a means to become more powerful and to no longer be the mere tool of others. the remains have since begun trying to take over his body.\

 ino yamanaka is a childhood friend of sakura haruno who was bullied due to her large forehead, ending when ino befriended her. she acted like a mentor, being tougher and more confident. under her influence, sakura began to develope her own identity. though close to ino, sakura could not help but feel she was in her shadow and upon learning they liked the same boy, ended their friendship so that they could compete for his affection, beginning a bitter rivalry. ino shed her tomboyish look in retaliation and was more open about her feelings towards sasuke. the rivalry stays till the chunin exam. nevertheless, they have a competitive relationship. she became somewhat superficial, thinking highly of her looks and has no problem telling people what she thinks, no matter how hurtful, such as telling choji that he should focus more on his appearance because girls dislike overweight boys. on the surface of things, both of her teammates fit the profiles of people she wouldn't associate with because of her apparent shallowness, but she actually cares deeply for their well-beings and maintains a strong bond with them. it should be noted that while ino is portrayed as shallow she came to sakura's aid in the forest of death despite their feud. she cares very much about her friends, showing deep loyalty.\
 \
 as a member of the yamanaka clan, ino works in her family's flower shop and has become particularly talented in ikebana. she has been noted to be sharp upon occasion, such as noticing asuma's affection for kurenai or using chakra cleverly. the anime's filler arcs show that she's been able to find other uses for her time in the shop and can tell a person's profession by simply glancing at the condition of their hands. being a yamanaka has also shaped the mind-altering jutsu she uses. with the mind body switch technique, ino can transfer to another's body and use it for a time. the anime explains her medical abilities. during the final filler arc, ino finds herself of no use to her teammates and becomes awed of sakura's skills. as such, ino becomes tsunade's second apprentice, hoping to be more useful to her friends. the anime has also shown that ino has developed her own inner-self named \"inner ino\". she, along with team 10 plus kakashi, aids in the dispersion of two of akatsuki's members.\

 \
 inoichi, presumably the head of the yamanaka clan, has shown himself to be a highly capable ninja. he is well-versed in all of his clan's secret techniques. during the invasion of konoha in part i, inoichi skilfully performs the mind body disturbance technique  to make the invaders he encounters fight against their own allies without any self-control. further proof of his skill was shown from his status as an interrogator during pain's invasion. he was able to skilfully probe the mind of one pain's amegakure loyalist's, able to perceive a person's entire day of memories in under a minute, even though pain had guarded it with mental blocks and traps. he has also shown the ability to communicate telepathically with his daughter, ino.\

 zetsu is seemingly very trustworthy, being entrusted with knowledge of pain and tobi's identities. he has apparently been working with the latter for some time, tobi first appearing as his \"subordinate\" and zetsu later commenting that tobi's plans have been in the works for a long time.\

 zetsu's main role within the akatsuki is to function as a spy, often acting as a hunter-nin for akatsuki. he has been shown able to move his body and take part in the tailed beasts sealing ritual imultaneously which, in addition to being unique to him, allows him to act as a lookout while the sealing takes place. when an agent to akatsuki, or possibly even a member, dies, zetsu is sent to devour their bodies so as to not have their secrets revealed. zetsu is also the one sent to retrieve the rings of dead akatsuki members. due to the role he plays, zetsu is the only member of akatsuki to act without a partner on a regular basis. despite this, zetsu serves as a sort of superior to other members, as they often report directly to him instead of the actual leader, pain.\

 in 1931, chane boarded the flying pussyfoot as part of the terrorist group that wished to use its passengers as hostages, in order to negotiate huey's release from prison. chane did not approve of the terrorists' methods, and knew they only wished to obtain huey in order to gain access to his secrets about immortality. she also knew that at some point, the group planned to betray and kill her. yet, she went along with their plans in order to see how much they would be able to accomplish. \

 while aboard the flying pussyfoot, chane has a run-in with the sadistic assassin ladd russo, from the russo mafia family. they engage in a fierce battle, where chane's fighting skills impress and delight ladd. the fight is eventually interrupted by the \"rail tracer,\" who takes a liking to chane and proposes to her. the proposal shocks the young girl as it is the first time someone has ever professed love to her. at the rail tracer's request, she engraves her reply to him into the train's roof.\

 after the events aboard the flying pussyfoot, chane is taken in and cared for by jacuzzi splot and his gang. their kindness confuses chane, who does not understand why they went out of their way to help her as she is a stranger and member of the terrorist group. \

 in the manga, what drives miyabi to go bad and lead a rebellion against teachers is an incident which occurred when she was in the 7th grade. she had been the favorite student of mr. ogi, teacher of class 2-4 (the name of her class back in junior high). ogi would praise her for her beauty and intelligence often. miyabi misinterpreted this as mr. ogi having a crush on her. as a result, miyabi began behaving and dressing in a more mature manner. she started cooking him lunch every day. she also started wearing revealing clothes ( such as miniskirts and tanktops). instead of setting miyabi straight, mr. ogi went along with it. to some degree, he did like miyabi. he continued to praise her and accept her subtle advances. one day, miyabi is invited to mr. ogi's house. she goes, thinking he is going to confess his love for her. as soon as she gets there, mr. ogi introduces her to his fiance. miyabi storms off in tears, feeling hurt and used. as revenge, miyabi takes illicit photos of herself and goes into class the next morning telling her classmates that mr. ogi raped her and then took pictures (knowing that mr. ogi's hobby is photography). since that day, miyabi has hated teachers.\

 the azusa fuyutsuki portrayed in the live action drama differs greatly from the anime and manga versions. in that version, fuyutsuki became a teacher because she felt she was forced to, and envies the life of her sister, who became a stewardess who frequently dates male celebrities (and receive some fancy gifts as well.) she eventually decides to remain a teacher thanks to some convincing from onizuka, though the two are continuously depicted as at odds with each other with love strongly implied. the live-action version of fuyutsuki also has a dislike for men in general, finding them too possessive over women, though onizuka also convinces her that she too is guilty of that same sin. interestingly, she is also present to many of the \"lessons\" that onizuka personally teaches his students. \

          description = "the antithesis to the \"dumb blonde\" stereotype, urumi kanzaki is a prodigy with an iq over 200. she is also a heterochromatic, possessing different colored eyes: one brown and one blue. however, she is psychologically disturbed, having her fair share of hate toward teachers. her genius is displayed repeatedly by such abstract actions as the detonation of time bombs (i.e. firecrackers in disposable boxes) and making a harmless snake look like a cobra using paper cutouts. her intellect is also shown through actions, such as shouting curse words in french and being able to speak fluent mandarin. on the trip in okinawa, toshito kikuchi noted that she can speak 5 languages, but ironically, she doesn't understand what her gundam otaku roommates say. \
 her hatred for teachers stems from her time in elementary school. urumi's teacher, ms. fujimori, while initially welcoming and receptive, wasn't able to handle her intellect properly, since she went to a second-rate college, and it was her first year teaching. urumi's constant requests for the teacher's time, both inside and outside of school, as well as the fact that the lessons she wanted to learn from the teacher included extremely advanced, college-level subjects (such as differential calculus) eventually made the teacher snap. when urumi interrupted ms. fujimori's lecture to correct her in front of the whole class, the teacher then told urumi's secret to her class. while it isn't stated explicitly, it can be deduced that her intelligence is derived from her biological father, when urumi tells eikichi onizuka that her mother had selected a sperm-donor, based on his intellect and nothing more. it is even suggested that her mother took the sperm from an american scientific genius (this information can be gleaned from a scene where urumi and her mother visited some friends in the united states, and urumi was led into a dark storage room by a doctor, who explains to her that her father is actually just a bottle of donated sperm); this also explains urumi's natural, blond hair. naturally, this caused a great deal of psychological trauma to urumi, and quite an understandable hatred of teachers. it is still unclear what happened to ms. fujimori, as her last appearance in the storyline was begging onizuka to help urumi before something terrible happens to her.\
 \
 she is later found by miyabi in a small apartment, and hired to torture onizuka. formerly a student at holy forest for a while, but stopped attending regularly after some time, she begins almost immediately, as she frames him for lechery and sends him to jail overnight, only to appear in class and on his homeroom roster the morning after. onizuka's frustration with her vastly increases, when vice-principal uchiyamada strictly advises him that he cannot inflict physical harm on her due, to her educational potential. urumi is eventually able to turn onizuka into her slave (more-or-less, her \"genie\") by threatening to have him arrested, after she fakes her death when he accidentally pushes her off a building.\
 \
 however, all this changes when she encounters her ms. fujimori again, awakening her deepest hatred and causing her to direct her wrath at the student body. onizuka responds by bringing his biker gang to school and \"kidnaps\" her from class. he is finally able to get through to her by almost killing the two of them by jumping over - and nearly falling into - a gap at a suspension bridge, despite her attempts to convince him that she is not afraid of anything, including death. onizuka makes her see past her trauma, however bad, just isn't worth messing up the present with (in the manga, he does this by having his biker friends share their life experiences with her). inspired, she allies with onizuka, and helps with his troubles.\
 \
 despite her switch in allegiance, urumi continues her feud with miyabi, until miyabi reveals her origins to the student body. urumi retaliates by setting up a web page, where she promises to post pictures of miyabi in her bathroom (urumi had earlier placed a hidden camera), after a countdown timer reaches zero. however, the site reveals only a single photograph of urumi, miyabi, and tomoko nomura during their younger years. urumi never had any intention of ruining miyabi; she just wanted to scare her. urumi attempts suicide at an indoor skiing arena by freezing to death, but onizuka rescues her. it is after this incident that urumi considers onizuka to be her \"favorite.\"\
 \
 she grows extremely infatuated with onizuka, to the point of wanting to elope with onizuka. urumi takes a more stereotypical role of a character that prefers the use of violence, in response to jealousy - she is often seen beating onizuka mercilessly every time he tries to fulfill his pervertednes. urumi states onizuka should wait for her hormones to start kicking in, because she's sure that she would have a bouncing body by then. like noboru yoshikawa, her loyalty to onizuka is extremely strong, to the point that she would consider suicide, if he were to leave, believing that her own life is worthless without him around.\

 kikuchi eventually befriends onizuka, and later helps noboru yoshikawa prevent anko uehara's mother, the president of the local parent-teacher association, from getting onizuka fired. kikuchi is an amateur martial artist, having prior experience in judo and other techniques learned from mayu wakui (in the live-action, he claims he only knows it, and does not demonstrate this claim). it is revealed after the examinations that he was the one who switched onizuka's test papers for a perfect score. when questioned about the actual results that onizuka has, kikuchi calculates it himself, and is thoroughly surprised at the score (it is unknown whether onizuka actually did score perfect, or a score befitting his intelligence), and asks him directly, to which his teacher replies that he definitely received a perfect score.\

 unfortunately, he nearly messes up by forgetting to take the public teachers' civil service exam. as a result, no public high school will take him, but he is still eligible for a number of private schools. he manages to get a job at the upper-crust holy forest academy, despite the objections of vice-principal uchiyamada hiroshi, whom he continues to aggravate well into his tenure. of course, one of the conditions of having the job at holy forest is that he must sleep at the school&mdash;in the storage room at the top floor, with roof access&mdash;and it is here that onizuka officially starts his career in teaching, when he stops yoshikawa noboru from committing suicide.\
 \
 onizuka is put in charge of class 3-4, a class so bad it has already driven several teachers insane. not only does he survive the class's brutal bullying tactics, but he also befriends his students, and the backbone to the story of great teacher onizuka consists of his unique experiences in turning his students around and learning lessons of his own.\
 \
 it is later implied again, during the national exams, that onizuka might actually be some sort of genius. his exam results were swapped: once for full marks, and once for just short of full marks. however, when yoshito kikuchi is asked whether he is curious about onizuka's true results, he checks the answers himself and the result amazes him. he checks with onizuka, who states that he definitely got perfect results from his own effort (which would be incredible, since he did a 5 hour exam in 1 hour, bleeding, and having 4 bullets in his stomach).\
 \
 onizuka has incredible physical resilience. on more than one occasion, he has fallen from heights that would instantly kill most people and claims to have a sort of healing factor, as he healed from a broken arm in less than a day, and even endure multiple gunshot wounds, in a short period of time. onizuka often presents his strength in unintentionally flamboyant ways, such as arm wrestling over 100 men of exponential strength in a row and winning (including the character heihachi from the tekken series of fighting games, and jason voorhees from the films called friday the 13th (series)). his fighting abilities are not to be taken lightly either, as onizuka is capable of fending off multiple opponents, even if they are well-armed, and almost never receives any physical damage.\
 \
 in spite of his impressive fighting skills, onizuka is often roughed up by his students, and others, whenever he behaves badly. it could be speculated that deep down, onizuka knows when he's acting immature, and allows others to keep him in line. an example of this is when he forces his students to dig the earth for buried treasure during the okinawa trip. kanzaki urumi kicks onizuka into a hole, and later forces him to wear s&m garb and has him crawl around on all fours, with urumi riding on his back. yet another example is when principal uchiyamada has onizuka over for dinner and hits him upside the head with a wooden bench after finding out that onizuka was acting a bit of a letch with his daughter one day (onizuka was playing \"where's the nipple\" with his daughter, at a karaoke bar in town).\
 \
 his personal mode of transportation is a kawasaki z2 motorcycle 750cc type s. the bike itself is also featured heavily in the prequel series to gto.\

 ohsawa is not seen, after onizuka finishes his training, but it is revealed that he was caught having an affair with a student, and left for another training session, away from musashino high. \

  while still cold to onizuka, anko allies with him, after being fed up with miyabi aizawa's manipulation of others for her own gain. when onizuka is framed for embezzeling funds for the school trip, she offers her credit card for use, but he flat-out refuses.\
 on the school field trip to okinawa, her mean streak towards noboru continues to persist, even escalating, as he and onizuka start playing pranks of their own against her and her friends. in an ironic twist, noboru saves her life, after her own prank fails. during a near-death experience, a flashback reveals her bullying stems from growing up with an abusive, older brother, who in turn, was abused by their father.\
 shortly after, she develops feelings for him, and unsuccessfully tries to deny them. it takes an onizuka scheme to get her to admit it.\

 kenji harima is the male protagonist, an ex-delinquent who loves tenma. although he does not practice any specific martial arts style, few people are able to match him in hand-to-hand combat. he has the ability to communicate with animals, and possesses a wide variety of strange and exotic pets which he named after european monarchs. he has a little brother, shuuji, who likes yakumo.\
 \
 harima struggles often to confess to tenma, though he knows she has absolutely no feelings for him and may even dislike him. every time harima finds the courage to tell tenma his true feelings, something happens which prevents him from succeeding. harima also must deal with situations involving his classmate eri, unaware of the fact that she does not know whether to like or dislike him. he gets extremely jealous seeing karasuma and tenma together, but his attempts to put a stop to that usually end up bringing them closer. ironically, harima admires nijō jō(二条丈) the mangaka, which is karasuma's pen name. to date, tenma has yet to hear his confession properly. he also works as a mangaka, having yakumo as his assistant, creating another source of misunderstandings, as it took a long time for tenma to realize that their relationship is only professional, at least by harima's side.\
 \
 in the manga school rumble z last chapter, harima is seen walking in the hospital room (where the karasuma is) together with eri, who is holding a baby and with a blushing face. \

 karasuma ouji is tenma's love interest, often depicted as a stone-faced eccentric. he enjoys odd habits such as dressing as a kappa during rainy days, embodying a japanese pun on the word for raincoat. he enjoys eating curry. although unspoken, he seems to be excellent at dodging any flying projectiles including harima's hurricane kick and tenma's arrow letters. karasuma is secretly a famous mangaka, publishing his works under the pen name of nijou jou. he is in a band at school, and plays an electric guitar. he also played soccer, and recently won a cup with the national soccer team in the anime. although he doesn't demonstrate any feeling for tenma (or anything else), behind his poker face he sometimes shows true concern for her in the story.\

 despite her strength she has a kind nature and is one of the more timid girls in 2-c. she is in love with imadori, but gets embarrassed when this is hinted at. imadori also initially avoids her, not only because of her small measures (later it is revealed that she does have considerably large breasts), but also because he fears her strength. she is also a good singer, and her singing is featured in episodes 2 and 6 of school rumble - second term.\
 \
 when imadori met her practicing wrestling and asked her why she liked it, she said that she really did not want to do wrestling. later, when imadori, along with harima and hanai were working for a moving company, they found out that ichijou was also working with them as well as how strong she was. at the end of their shift, imadori accidentally said that he could take karen out on a date with his earnings, which karen agrees to, even though imadori did not really mean it.\

 armored gorilla is an artificial mutant created by dr. genus of the house of evolution. unlike his peers, armored gorilla's body is mostly robotic, making him the third-strongest specimen in the house of evolution, and its only battle cyborg. \
 \
 appearance: armored gorilla is a massive cyborg with a gorilla head. his body is protected by full plate armor adorned with spikes on its shoulders, knee pads, and gauntlets. the armor's belt buckle resembles a gorilla's face, and the chest plate features a custom patch featuring the letters 'a' and 'g' arranged in a diamond shape.\
 \
 while armored gorilla's head appears biological, it also houses cybernetic components.\
 \
 personality: initially, armored gorilla behaves like an automaton, communicating with technical readouts in a robotic, monotone voice. after he and his colleagues (beast king, in particular) are defeated, however, he drops this facade and speaks normally, admitting he was simply trying to act cool.\
 \
 under duress, armored gorilla is spineless, apologizing profusely and bargaining for his life by revealing information about his creator, dr. genus, and the house of evolution.\

 personality: ashura kabuto is an extremely unstable being. he is very intelligent, but has an insatiable blood lust and thus had to be locked up because he kept killing anything that got near him. he considers himself far superior to humans, calling himself a 'new human' that dr. genus was looking for, and believing that all should bow to his will.\

 personality: atomic samurai has a rather prideful personality, seen when he refused to shake saitama's hand telling him that he only acknowledges the strong and saying that he would greet him if he makes it to the higher ranks of s-class. he also appears to dislike being called old.\

 lord boros is the leader of the dark matter thieves, a group of alien invaders who attacked and destroyed a-city.\
 \
 appearance: lord boros is a slim, cyclopean alien with lightly colored spiky hair and pointed ears, which are adorned with multiple earrings. his face is covered with crack-shaped markings that start from his eye(and cover most of his body presumably). in the area of his body below his chest, there seems to be another eye, which moves in synced with his original one. at first, he is seen wearing a full body armour that suppresses his powers. when the armour is broken by saitama's punch, he attains a more intimidating and slightly more muscular build, while his skin darkens in colour, parts of his body grow scales and spikes, and his markings start emitting energy, and gain a lighter colour. in his meteoric burst form, his appearance changes drastically. his hair grow reaching his back, his eye's sclera becomes black, and his body becomes engulfed in energy, while his markings now return to their original, dark colour.\
 \
 personality: thanks to his amazing powers, boros is both arrogant and prideful. due to his love of battles and inability to find any opponent who has been able to match him in power, he roams the universe looking for worthy opponents that would be stand against him. he met a prophet that revealed to him that in a far off planet he would finally find a strong opponent that would be able to fight on par with him, giving boros the enjoyable fight he had always desired.\

 geryuganshoop was one of the alien invaders who attacked a-city.\
 \
 geryuganshoop is an alien with a face that consists of nothing more than three holes, two being eyes and one being a mouth. its body is entirely black with little to no detail. it has no arms or legs, but rather a multitude of tentacle-like appendages. in anime, he appears to possess blue body covered with translucent skin, which turns rainbow-colored in fight.\
 \
 geryuganshoop is loyal to lord boros; willing to throw himself in danger to defend him from intruders. at the same time, he recognizes his own rank and hands out orders to all members of the dark matter thieves from a control room, namely the various workers on board the ship. he is calculative in most circumstances, but can lose his cool if the ship and those within it are put in danger. in regard to his prowess in battle, geryuganshoop is somewhat arrogant and believes that there is not another psychic in the entire universe that surpasses his skill. as such, he thinks of himself as much more powerful than he truly is; attempting to handle even an intruder that has wiped out a large portion of the ship and its workers on his own.\

 \
 sonic is a villain, first appearing as a bodyguard hired by zeniru. he views saitama as his eternal rival.\
 \
 <b>appearance:</b> sonic is a thin, slightly effeminate man, who despite his slender build is extremely strong and fast. he has black medium length hair that is tied up in a topknot. one noticeable feature is that he has two purple marks under his eyes, one under each. he first appears wearing a tight black outfit highlighted by metal plating on the shins, fore-arms, shoulders and chest, as well as a long purple scarf. he is shown later in black street clothes. he always carries a ninjato and other ninja equipment such as kunai and ninja stars.\
 \
 <b>personality:</b> sonic is a villain who, despite his normally calm appearance, loves fighting strong opponents as shown by when he gets a \"child-like smile\" on his face when he first meets saitama and has two of his attacks blocked, earlier calling this his \"bad habit.\" he seems to be very quick to act as he attacks saitama on their first meeting without letting him explain the situation.\
 \
 after being defeated by saitama for the first time (episode 4), while working as a bodyguard for zeniru, he devotes his time into finding a way to defeat him.\

 rei ayanami is the first child, and the pilot of evangelion unit 00. she is shown to be socially withdrawn and hardly interacts with anyone. rei's cool, silent and emotionally-stunted personality has garnered the scorn of her schoolmates; asuka calls her a \"doll\" or \"puppet.\"\
 \
 although she once only associated with gendou, she and shinji break the ice after the battle against ramiel, and grow progressively closer for a while. \
 \
 clones of her, which lack souls, are kept hidden under the nerv building to be the supposed \"cores\" of the dummy plugs.\
 \
 also, it is hinted that rei died twice; in the series, this stems from the fact that rei herself says \"i think i'm the third one,\" shortly after her death when unit 00 self-destructed, an event that she could not remember. the first rei is shown to have died as a small girl at the hands of dr. naoko akagi for revealing carelessly (or perhaps in an intentional set-up by gendou ikari) to naoko that gendou called her a \"useless old hag.\" the explanation is that her soul and most of her memories are transferred to one of the clones every time she dies, which then takes the preceding rei's place as if she had not died at all.\

 his progress is all undone when he is forced to kill the only person who ever openly expressed love toward him. his only friends are toji and kensuke, but he apparently cares about rei more than even he realizes, although everyone around him seems to think that his feelings are obvious. despite his rapport with rei, asuka is a sexual presence in his life, and is ultimately shown to be a figure of great emotional importance to him as well. though not immediately apparent, their relationship is a powerful driving force for both characters throughout the series. their confused, back-and-forth emotional interchanges are a source of considerable guilt and tension for both parties. while asuka is attracted to shinji, she is afraid to admit to being dependent on anyone; so instead of expressing affection, she teases shinji (often with sexual overtones), hoping to \"provoke\" him into initiating a closer relationship. significantly, she gives him his first kiss (supposedly out of boredom, though the director's cut makes clear that the kiss meant a lot more to her than she lets on). however, due to his own emotional issues, shinji is unable to recognize asuka's actions for their true intent, and is only confused and hurt by her flirting mixed with abuse. \
 \
 since asuka is constantly heaping him with accusations and blame, his most natural response is to withdraw and hide himself, both emotionally and literally. to make matters worse, asuka only finds herself more and more frustrated by shinji's failure to respond to her advances, and in turn only abuses him more and more harshly, which only makes him withdraw further, thus continuing the vicious cycle. their tense relationship reaches a breaking point toward the end of the story; when asuka's stress finally causes her to degrade into a completely withdrawn state, shinji tries to comfort her, only to be coldly rejected.\
 later on, when asuka has further been reduced to a comatose state and shinji has also suffered incredible mental duress, he goes to her bedside to beg for help, only to end up masturbating over her partially nude (and comatose) body. wracked with guilt and completely lost to his own self-hatred, he enters a completely withdrawn state, not unlike asuka's earlier on.\
 \
 ultimately, when shinji chooses to reject instrumentality, he finds asuka to be the only other person on earth, and they painfully reconcile.\

 asuka is the second child ('second children' in the japanese versions of nge), who pilots evangelion unit 02. she is from germany, but with an american father and a half-german, half-japanese mother. in the rebuild of evangelion series of movies, her name is changed to asuka langley shikinami.\
 \
 her mother, kyoko zeppelin souryuu, went insane after an eva-related experiment and began to believe that a doll that resembled asuka was, in fact, her daughter, to the point that she refused to acknowledge the real asuka. kyoko zeppelin souryuu committed suicide on the very day that asuka was chosen to become an eva pilot. on that day, asuka promised herself that she would never cry again. this event gives her an innate hatred of dolls and all things that she perceives to be doll-like, especially rei. despite those feelings asuka shows no hesitation when required to cooperate with rei when necessary, proving her to be committed and professional regarding her duties as an eva pilot.\
 \
 asuka's father later remarried a woman for whom asuka feels no affection. asuka feels the need to verbally and sometimes physically lash out at everyone around her, except to her unrequited crush, kaji, who is misato's ex-boyfriend and more than twice asuka's age. on her better days, however, she can be quite cheerful and friendly.\
 \
 like shinji, asuka also has a difficulty being close to people, except unlike shinji, who shells himself, asuka's coping mechanism is over-aggressiveness and so she unintentionally hurts people she likes, pushing them away and thus sinking further into loneliness and self resentment. this issue is referred to as the \"hedgehog's dilemma\" and is a recurring motif in the story.\

 kensuke is named after a main character in the novel the fascism of love and fantasies (ai to gensou no fascism) by ryu murakami. he is also similar in appearance to the character jean, from hideaki anno's earlier anime nadia: the secret of blue water.\

 she is the daughter of naoko akagi, the developer of the magi supercomputer system which controls nerv. in many ways, ritsuko is living in the shadow of her mother, whom she both admires and despises. naoko was the head scientist working on the evangelion project before her death, and ritsuko is continuing the work her mother began with the evas, as well as continuing the development of the magi supercomputer system. flashbacks to a teenaged ritsuko reveal that she is a natural brunette, just like her mother.\
 \
 ritsuko is extremely intelligent, with a strong dedication to her work and a stoic, detached attitude which is frequently contrasted against misato katsuragi's hot-headness, especially during eva combat. her occasional jibes at misato are a source of comic relief in the series. she has a great affinity for cats, and misato chides her at one point for substituting her cats for human affection. she also is a heavy smoker, as evidenced by an ashtray on her desk filled with cigarette butts stained by her lipstick.\

          description = "once a professor of meta-biology at kyoto university, kohzou fuyutsuki is now deputy commander of nerv under gendo. but he is not a military man, despite his professional bearing and seeming ease of command. in the director's cut, it is revealed that he has had some sort of training as a physician though he has either lost or never acquired a license to practice medicine. there is no indication given during the series of any romantic relationships or of any dependents. in the episode the birth of nerv, in several flashbacks, a few of his students and the superior professor at his institute (who first suggests that he take on the young and brilliant yui ikari as a research assistant) suggest that he be more sociable; this hints at fuyutsuki being a classically withdrawn academic, and possibly a life-long bachelor. shortly after beginning his academic (and platonically affectionate and supportive) association with yui ikari, he was directed by his institution's superiors to initiate a similar arrangement with the then gendo rokoboungi. \
 given later revelations about apparent decades-long behind-the-scenes machinations of seele into all aspects of the sciences directly and indirectly involved in the subject of instrumentality (the dead sea scrolls were uncovered in 1947, so presumably the world-wide conspiracy behind seele's operations had been in existence for only slightly less time) it is safe to say that professor fuyutsuki had been monitored by and targeted for recruitment by seele early in his career. if speculations regarding yui actually having been a junior member of seele through her father's influence are correct, then fuyutsuki's association with gendo rokoboungi/ikari was equally planned well in advance. his earlier introduction to rokoboungi/ikari by taking him on as a research assistant, bailing him out of jail, and later meeting him again after second impact during a research expedition to the area formerly occupied by antarctica may be seen as steps in a testing procedure to determine his reliability, discretion and intelligence at being able to surmise seele's goals...and whether he would actually be amenable to that recruitment.\
 \
 fuyutsuki's earlier assessment of gendo ikari's personality (in the director's cut, the subtitle during fuyutsuki's recall of the initial meeting at the police station refers to rokoboungi/ikari as 'real bastard') was reinforced by the antarctic mission, during which fuyutsuki began to suspect that the now gendo ikari's associates in seele may be more powerful and dangerous than he originally realized. the seed of doubt planted during that voyage led to the discovery of the true nature of the events leading up to second impact and seele's involvement in initiating that catastrophe.\
 \
 after fuyutsuki threatened to expose gendo to the public, regarding the massive deception concerning second impact, in 2003 (through his own research), gendo ikari led him into the geofront and central dogma and revealed to him an incomplete prototype eva. at that point, ikari asked fuyutsuki to join him and \"create a new future for humankind, together with me.\" fuyutsuki accepted this, and started to help gendo. whether this agreement was entirely out of idealism or more from self-preservation is not made clear. in the movie the end of evangelion it is mentioned that seele had threatened fuyutsuki with being 'disappeared'; the implication is that this recruitment may have been a hobson's choice.\
 \
 despite fuyutsuki's initial dislike of gendo, it is clearly evident that he becomes the closest thing that gendo has to a confidant in the series. in many episodes, fuyutsuki may be seen as a sort of external conscience for gendo ikari; despite his somewhat gruff nature, fuyutsuki is genuinely concerned for those under his commend, but having the added knowledge of seele's true goals for instrumentality, must balance his compassion with ikari's ruthlessness in pursuing both seele's agenda and ikari's own hidden one of re-uniting with his discarnate yui. ikari's dependence upon fuyutsuki as both confidant and his chief lieutenant is shown by the many times that fuyutski takes the initiative for action without waiting for direction from ikari.\
 \
 as had been mentioned and implied in the series, while obviously kindly disposed towards yui, at all times fuyutsuki maintained a professional demeanor towards her. it is not intimated how the destrudo experiment that 'killed' her and ensconced her soul into eva unit 01 affected him. the depth of his feelings for her, however, is revealed when immediately prior to dematerializing into lcl during instrumentality, fuyutsuki witnesses an image of lilith-as-yui which appears to float down to embrace him, comforting him in his transition to a non-corporeal state.\

 maya ibuki is a first lieutenant at nerv and a computer technician who works primarily with ritsuko akagi. her main role during the fights with the angels is to constantly monitor the eva pilots&rsquo; synchronization ratios and send various emergency commands to the evangelions as ordered by misato or gendo. her implementation scene during the the end of evangelion movie has been read by many fans as a revelation that she is secretly in love with ritsuko. when maya's instrumentality occurs, lilith (in the form of ritsuko) types \"i need you\" into maya's laptop and embraces her. maya's reversion to lcl comes after an ecstatic gasp of \"senpai!\" however, this scene is the only one that alludes to her possible feelings towards ritsuko, and its intention is not clear. in spite of her profession, maya despises violence of any sort, and is frequently shown becoming nauseous and averting her eyes during battles with the angels. notably, in the end of evangelion, maya is the only nerv officer who is shown refusing to fight back against the jssdf invaders. she rejects the gun shigeru hands her to defend herself saying \"i can't shoot this thing\", not because she is unskilled, but because she has never shot it at a human being. throughout much of the second half of end of evangelion maya is seen with her face buried in a pink pillow under her desk.\

 she is sometimes described as representing the audience's views throughout the series, as she shows revulsion when it would be most likely for the viewer to do the same, and delight in other, more light-hearted scenes.\

 yui ikari is one of the more powerful presences in the series, yui is shown to be kind, optimistic, and motherly. her faith in humanity and belief that it is worth preserving and remembering stand out when compared to the more cynical characters on the rest of the cast.\
 \
 yui became romantically involved with a mysterious man, several years older than herself, named gendo rokubungi, who was constantly the source of shady rumors  among them that gendo had approached yui for nothing but her talent and her affiliation with seele. regardless, in yui's own words, he was \"quite a sweet person. it's just that no one knows it.\"\
 \
 yui took up work at the artificial evolution laboratory in hakone, japan, which was really a front for seele's secret research organization, gehirn. her skills in bioengineering went towards the \"adam revival project\", more commonly called \"project e\". in 2004, yui volunteered herself as the test subject for the contact experiment with the incomplete eva-01 (a decision she had made by autumn of the previous year). she brought the 4-year-old shinji to the site of the experiment so that she could \"show [him] the bright future\". the experiment, ostensibly, was part of gehirn's research into the creation of artificial souls, but it resulted in a \"freak accident\" instead, wherein her soul was absorbed into the eva's core and her body reverted to lcl. gendo subsequently undertook a \"salvage operation\" that attempted to recreate yui's body and fix her soul back into it, but this failed, instead resulting in the creation of the first rei ayanami.\
 yui's soul remained inside of eva-01 throughout the series, with her son shinji piloting it to defeat the angels. despite nerv's extensive system of restraints, yui's soul could take control of the eva's body in situations where shinji was in extreme danger. her control manifested itself in berserk mode, a state of greatly increased power and savagery.\
 \
 she first moved all by herself in episode 01, protecting shinji from falling lights and in the following battle in episode 02, where she took control and defeated sachiel when eva-01 shut down after sustaining severe damage from the angel. in episode 16, she made contact with her son and took control of the eva immediately before all power to the life support systems failed, breaking out of and killing the twelfth angel, leliel. finally, she manifested in episode 19 against the fourteenth angel, zeruel. this time, in addition to taking control over the evangelion and quickly defeating the angel, she also ingested its s&sup2; engine engine in the process.\
 when third impact arrived and rei iii rejected gendo, control of third impact was given to shinji and, ultimately, yui. after shinji's rejection of the human instrumentality project, yui took the spear of longinus and floated out towards space, becoming an eternal testament to humanity's existence, as evangelion unit-01.\
 yui reveals to gendo that she believes anyone can find heaven; they must have the will to survive and they will attain happiness. this belief is passed on to shinji, first in his return to the physical world in episode 20, and later in his choice to be \"alive\" (existing as human in physical form with an at field) rather than accept instrumentality. yui's beliefs may also be exemplified in her romantic relationship with gendo, however gendo's desire to be associated with seele raised questions concerning whether he was truly in love with yui or whether he was using her to get closer to seele. the fact that his every action for the next decade was made in pursuit of reuniting with yui suggests he was not just using her; conversely, since she kept some of her agenda secret from gendo, she may in a sense have been using him.\
 in episode 21, yui describes gendo as \"...quite a sweet person. it's just that no one knows it.\"\
 yui has her own agenda, different from seele's, and ultimately different from gendo's as well. much , but not all of her agenda is presented in the series.\
 after yui (presumably) graduated, she married gendo, and the latter took on her surname he became involved with seele, joining the katsuragi expedition to serve as an auditor, although it is not revealed what yui was doing during this time. after gendo returned, they had a child together, shinji who, if a girl, would have been named rei.\
 \
 she died in 2004 as a result of her contact experiment with eva-01, but her spirit lives on within the eva as eternal proof of humanity's existence.\

 after he returns to nerv headquarters, kaji and misato rekindle their romance following a period of teasing and insults, when misato confesses that she broke up with him because she realized that kaji reminded her of her father. he is eventually shot by an unnamed assailant, described as \"a third party working either for seele or for nerv's intelligence division\" in the episode film-book. in the manga, it is commander ikari who personally kills kaji. \

 kaworu nagisa is both the 17th angel and the fifth child. although classified as an angel, kaworu is similar to rei ayanami in being a seed of life that inhabits a human body. despite his human form, kaworu does not consider himself to be human, since he refers to humans as \"the lilin\".\
 kaworu appears humming the fourth movement of beethoven's ninth symphony, the same music that plays during his descent into terminal dogma and so serves as a leitmotif for his character. the ninth symphony itself incorporates an adaptation friedrich schiller's ode to joy (ode an die freude), a poem dedicated to the unity of all men under god. the moment kaworu opens the doors to terminal dogma is in synch with the line \"und der cherub steht vor gott\"- \"and the cherub (angel) stands before god\".\
 kaworu's body appears to have been created as a result of the contact experiment with adam, wherein dna from an unknown human donor dove into and fused with adam's flesh, explaining hyuga's discovery that kaworu was \"born\" on the day of second impact. seele salvaged adam's disembodied soul into kaworu, whom they may have recovered in embryonic form in antarctica.\
 kaworu's origin from adam, only intimated in the anime, is flatly stated in sadamoto's manga.\
 since kaworu was delivered to nerv by seele, it is believed that kaworu has been living under seele's surveillance prior to his appearance in the series.\
 \
 kaworu is brought to nerv to replace asuka, who is no longer able to pilot unit-02. he is only able to pilot unit-02 because its soul is in hiding. in his first test, kaworu immediately achieves impressive synchronization results. it later emerges that kaworu is able to achieve whatever level of synchronization he chooses with unit-02.\

 presently, she is a two-star meister and a creator of a death scythe. she is a member of the elite unit, spartoi.\

 in the anime only, in the last episode, the kishin inferred that maka actually has weapon blood, due to her father, but chose to be a meister. \

 black☆star (ブラック☆スター, burakku☆sutā) is one of the main meisters that the series follows. black star is one of the survivors of the infamous star clan, the other being akane☆hoshi. which explains why black star has a star on his shoulder. his demon weapon partner is tsubaki nakatsukasa. he is a shadow weapon meister (暗器職人 anki shokunin in japanese) which is translated into dark arm meister in the english dub. currently, he is a two-star meister and a member of the elite student unit, spartoi. \
 \
 he is the descendant of a powerful and deadly assassin white star, who mifune fought previously. like white star, black star always holds a grudge, namely against mifune, who beat him up twice previously. he eventually is overcome by anger and goes after mifune, and wins, but harnesses his anger (simultaneously mastering tsubaki's enchanted sword mode) and defeats mifune fair and square.\

 he is patricia \"patti/patty\" thompson's and elizabeth \"liz\" thompson's meister and death's son. he was born from a fragment of shinigami's soul.\
 \
 being the son of shinigami, kid was singled out. the other students at shibusen were afraid to get close to him not only because he was shinigami's son, but because they were afraid that they'd get hurt. this continued until he became the meister of liz and patti. they became good comrades, and even helped kid. kid didn't, necessarily, experience friendship until he met the others. he is really grateful to have friends that are not afraid of him like the others at shibusen.\
 \
 kid has obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, or ocpd, which is manifested as an obsession over perfection. objects and surroundings that are symmetrical can distract him from missions, and he will usually start to break down and have fits if he notices asymmetrical objects around him. thus if anything is wrong by any measurement (a picture frame crooked, or not folding his toilet paper, for example), he will try to correct it right away, even at the cost of the mission at hand. he is so obsessed with symmetry that kid refuses to fight a battle unless everything is symmetrical, as he would be asymmetrical holding only one gun. even if an enemy is symmetrical in appearance, he will refuse to fight it and harm its symmetry. the fact that the left half of his bangs is marked with three white stripes causes him much stress. as a result of his ocpd, kid can be very hard on himself if the asymmetry of the stripes in his hair are pointed out by someone, calling himself \"useless asymmetrical garbage\". kid, trying to make himself completely symmetrical, tried to dye his hair once, but the sanzu lines continued to reappear. this is because his reaper body rejects all forms of chemicals and toxins, including artificial coloring like hair dye. the index of the book of eibon referred to this obsession as madness of order.\
 \
 his favorite number is 8, not only for its symmetry, but for the fact it divides out evenly. an example of one of his fits, and his love for the number 8, can be shown when he met soul on his first day of dwma. when soul said that if kid had arrived at 7 like he was suppose to he could look around himself. instead of focusing on the entire comment.. kid replied \"  \"no, it can't be seven! say eight, dammit! eight is better! it's physically impossible to cut the number seven in half and make it symmetrical! it has to be eight instead! eight cut vertically or horizontally stays perfectly symmetrical! take it back, i beg of you! please say eight! please!\", only to become further distressed when black star broke one of the spikes tips jutting out of his fathers, perfectly symmetrical, school.\
 \
 despite that his father wears a completely asymmetrical cloak, kid is not bothered by it at all, being that his love for his father outweighs his ocpd. he also doesn't seem to mind that his death god martial art- \"stance of sin\" requires him to hold his arms in asymmetrical position. showing that there are some things he can tolerate.\
 \
 he is usually very mature and precise in his ways. kid is naturally calm and collected, and as such is perfectly fine with other people making their own decisions when it comes to symmetry or otherwise, even if he disagrees with their choices. however, there are times when his obsession with symmetry can greatly affect his usually calm personality and cause him to break down into childish fits.\
 \
 due to his serious personality, kid is unaffected by nudity. while other male characters get nose bleeds, kid does not. during a battle with a female \"madness clown\" who was trying to distract kid with her nearly naked body, patti says, \"kid-kun is one of those perverts that gets distracted only when you make him rub your breasts! this won't affect him!\", but isn't actually because he is not a pervert, and is more matured than boys his age. considering patti is not the smartest person in the world she would think like this. when kid had to return to dwma, in order to get back to the fight on the moon sooner, kid had no problems walking in the girls bathroom to help, only to be dragged out by liz. later in the death room, kid is shown to have blood coming out of one side of his nose and mouth, having been punched by either liz or kim.\
 \
 of course, kid's being unaffected by nudity may also be the result of being a-sexual. given that his father created both him and asura a-sexually, and shinigami shows no interest in either gender, even when spirit hired blair and her friends to entertain them during their meeting, he showed no interest and was rather confused by their flirtation and later angry at them for goofing off when they should be discussing the rescue of his son. an example to prove this is when kid had visited soul and maka's apartment, when blair's towel fell off instead of getting a nosebleed like soul or black star, kid looked rather disgusted.\
 \
 he doesn't seem to have any problem socializing and genuinely cares for his friends. he is seen expressing concern about soul's scar at one point, and threatens gopher that he will never forgive him if he hurts maka after gopher threatens to hurt her in revenge for their original fight. he also threw patti and liz away from him before being sucked into the book of eibon, not wanting them to be taken with him.\
 \
 kid generally seems to be somewhat introverted, often working on missions on his own and not having as close of a friendship with maka or black☆star as maka and black☆star have with each other.\
 \
 it is mentioned by maka that it is normally hard to match soul wavelengths with more than one weapon, but kid as a highly skilled meister is able to do so since liz and patti have a strong connection with each other and admiration for kid who gave them a better life.\
 \
 his father, death, has mentioned that kid is a shinigami (\"death god\") and does not need to collect souls, but kid says he wants to make a weapon of his own specifications. his father also says that since he uses two weapons and the guns do not count as a set, he will have to collect twice as many souls: 198 evil human souls and two witch souls instead of 99 souls and one witch soul. however, he seems perfectly fine with this.\
 \
 kid shares a side rivalry with black☆star, and seems to be stronger, however it is possible that he is more susceptible to madness than black☆star or maka, for both were able to pull themselves from madness while he quickly succumbed to the madness of order in the book of eibon, while black☆star is able to quickly snap himself out of it. this may be because of his ocpd, or simply because of his strong drive to create a perfect world. it is also possible that being a shinigami, kid was weaker against the madness.\
 \
 although kid's obsession with symmetry often hinders his performance and focus on missions, he still has good intentions. he wants to follow in his dad's footsteps and help make the world a more peaceful place that is safe from evil.\

 living end: sid's signature attack where he uses his gravestone to pound his opponent into the ground, creating an enormous cross of soul energy. it can be utilized on the ground as well as in the air.\
 \
 compulsive burial: sid activates soul resonance with nygus, then stabs her (in knife form) into the ground which causes coffins to appear below a person and act as an escape route. this technique creates a simple way of escape by the means of an escape tunnel going directly downwards.\

 magic: her magic attacks in the form of snakes and uses the concept of vectors (directions).\
 \
 * vector arrow: sends arrow headed snakes to pierce the enemy. (follows medusa's hands)\
 * vector bullet: an arrow appears on the ground that will send anything on it in the direction that medusa desires; propelling herself towards the enemy to engage in close combat (against dr. stein and crona), propelling an attacker away from her, and quite possibly moving inanimate objects like chairs, tables, etc., turning them into deadly projectiles. also known as vector plate in the anime and some translations.\
 * serpent whip: medusa extends one of her snakes to strike from afar. known as light serpent in the anime.\
 * steam vector: this attack surrounds medusa with her vector arrows making a spinning tornado like shield. called vector storm in the anime.\
 * snake bomb: places a snake from her body into someone else; it will only detonate when she gives the signal.\
 * vector boost: a magic that doubles the power drawn in the direction of the arrow.\

 unlike other witches with their familiars the two seem to share a close friendship with each other despite eruka's apparent dominant role in the relationship, with even the normally docile eruka reprimanding free after he only slightly injures jackson. jackson in turn is extremely loyal to eruka, going so far as to help pass her the needle of black blood that is supposed to reawaken asura before black star can get at it, resulting in the tadpole getting beaten up by black star. eruka laments over this, and decides to fulfill the mission solely for jackson's sake.\

 attacks: his attacks center around his infinite one-sword style. he uses the blunt side of the sword if he has to fight children, first shown in the first fight he had with black star. however, he may also use his swords by throwing them into the ground and using them as platforms to travel across.\
 \
 start up: not an attack but more like the signal for mifune of the start of the fight by throwing his case of swords into the air then letting stick into the ground, surrounding his enemy and himself with swords thus giving mifune an near unlimited amount of swords to use. \
 \
 three shining paths: mifune will grab then throw three swords at the enemy.\
 \
 addition blows (1-12 blows): mifune moves at high speeds to attack his enemy. after each hit he will let go of his sword to quickly use another to let him attack from different angles while his enemy is stunned from his previous blow. this leaves his enemy covered with twelve swords.\
 \
 multiplication twenty four blows: mifune will follow his addition blows with this attack. he strikes the swords that he left around his enemy from his addition blows which ends up cutting his enemy with the twelve swords all over again. \

 forms: mosquito's body changes to the way it was at an earlier age to fight.\
 -100 years ago: the muscles in his upper body enlarge, giving him the appearance of a huge gorilla-like torso. his legs however, remain unchanged. this form is mosquito's toughest form and has been seen used twice.\
 -200 years ago: his limbs and nose extend in length, giving him a streamline, feline body structure. this form was when mosquito was the fastest, evasive and had his nose most lengthened. this form was revealed partially when the shibusen students had just defeated mosquito's first form and when fighting death the kid and free.\
 -400 years ago: in this form, with his soul wavelength swells up enormously, he takes up the shape of a young man with slick, combed hair. he is able to construct and reconstruct his body from bat-shaped darkness, and was able to sever one of kid's arms and free in half in barely one second. this form was when he was at his most numerous-legion.\
 -800 years: this form has only been mentioned.\
 \
 attacks: mosquito uses his needle nose for attacking, any other attacks depend on the form he is using.\
 -police stringer: mosquito extends his nose then thrusts himself (while spinning) in order to drill his victim on his nose.\
 -three piece police stringer: a more powerful version of the police stringer but it attacks three times.\
 -darkness discord: mosquito firstly sets up a pentacle under the target before splitting into a vortex of eight thousand bats, entrapping his victim within with destructive ultra-sonic waves.\

 in the two stand alone complex series, batou's personality is more like that in the manga version. he is an outgoing joker, but one with a quick temper. being emotional and not as calm as the major, batou shows anger at injustice and cruelty, to the point of seeming downright hotheaded at times. he sometimes shows impatience with section 9's rookies, such as togusa, to the point of rudeness, and jokes with him constantly.\
 \
 at times, he is also shown to be a voice of reason and concern for the major, to the point that she admits she can confide in him. both seasons of the anime, like the movies, hint at some romantic tension between the two, particularly near the end of each gig. this tension is touched upon, briefly, in the solid state society movie, where batou admits that he's been covering up any of the major's appearances in cases prior to the puppet master case.\
 \
 batou had served in a military special forces team before entering section 9. most of his body is comprised of cybernetic prosthetics. despite the fact that exercise will do his cybernetic body parts no benefits, batou lifts weights as a hobby. based on several of the stand alone complex episodes, batou seems to have served in the japanese ground self defense force at some point before he joined section 9. it is suggested several times that he held a jgsdf ranger qualification. his unit was involved in world war iv and was deployed to south america alongside motoko kusanagi, where they accidentally stumbled across an american imperial navy unit conducting a covert operation codenamed \"project sunset,\" which consisted of soldiers earning the trust of communities and then carrying out war crimes, spreading terror and chaos in the enemy ranks. batou's eyes are grey and clearly prosthetic. they are standard cybernetic equipment issued to ranger special forces operatives.\

 motoko kusanagi is the mysterious, even enigmatic woman who has led a group of specops for years, and was recruited by aramaki to work for section 9. almost nothing is known about her, her origins, birthdate, etc. she could not be older than 60 or so, since the widespread use of full-cyborgization was not in use until then. she was fully cyborged at a very young age and as she \"grew\" she went through a series of artificial bodies. this, more than anything, likely contributed to her great ease at controlling cyborg bodies of various types, even multiple at the same time.\
 \
 more mysterious is her incredible ability as a hacker, as she is equally at ease in a cyborg body as she is without one while diving the net; she is also officially registered as a super wizard class hacker. her romantic life does not officially involve anybody in the stand alone complex series; however, in the original manga she is bisexual and dates the leader of section 1 for some time.\
 \
 in the sac universe it is shown in that hideo kuze is the first person she ever loved, and her relationship with batou seems to be one of a close platonic trust.\
 whatever her age, major kusanagi now prefers the body of a 20-something woman. she is most often identifiable by her short violet hair and violet eyes in her stand alone complex design. her arise design features her with short, indigo hair and blue eyes and features the major at a younger age as she fights for her autonomy from unit 501 of the army.\

 ginko is a rare person who attracts mushi. this inspires his peripatetic lifestyle; staying in one place too long will gather a potentially dangerous amount of mushi. he also smokes constantly in order to keep mushi away.\
 \
 in terms of personality, ginko is rather laid back, but can be very serious when it comes to protecting people from mushi. he also often stresses that the mushi are not evil, but they merely exist as a part of the nature and try to survive like every other living being.\
 \
 when nui found him, he was unconscious in the woods, wounded and abandoned. as he had no place to go, nui decided to care for him instead of making him leave. he went by the name \"yoki\" until nui was consumed by the ginko mushi. yoki lost his memory and was forced to take a new name because of the nature of the ginko mushi, thus changing his name in the only thing he remembers, \"ginko\"\
 ginko's unusual white hair and green eye color is the result of an incident involving a mushi that occurred when he was a child.\
 he lost his other eye and hair color when he tried to save nui from the ginko mushi that lived in the pond near where they lived. nui protected ginko by telling him to offer them as a sacrifice so the ginko would let him be. he never saw nui again and after nearly being consumed by the mushi he adopted the name ginko to save himself.\

 since then, one in every other generation of the karibusa family has carried the forbidden mushi inside them, rendering part of their bodies ink black and useless. but they have learned how to bind it. by listening to stories of the death of other mushi, they can subdue the forbidden mushi and use its mark like ink to write these stories down and seal the forbidden mushi away on paper. those who do this are the recorders. they live in an isolated house with their records, visited only by the family and mushishi.\

 karibusa tanyuu is the fourth recorder. the curse is located on her right leg, and she has learned to be skillful at moving on crutches and hopping on one foot. and in spite of the pain that this forbidden mushi constantly causes her, she loves and respects mushi, all forms of life. she is proud but kind, and there is no one who could do her job more effectively.\
 \
 tanyuu's deepest desire is to complete the sealing away of the forbidden mushi, and to be freed to travel with ginko.\

 alphonse elric is a fictional character in the manga and anime series fullmetal alchemist. he is a human child who lost his body during a forbidden alchemical transmutation to bring his deceased mother back to life, and had his soul transmuted into a suit of armor by his brother, edward elric. al's blood seal lies just below the base of the neck at the back of the suit, on the inside. it is drawn with ed's blood. according to edward, he needs to be careful whenever he reconstructs alphonse's body because he must keep the blood seal intact during the transmutation. if the blood seal is removed, al's soul will be lost.\

 edward \"fullmetal alchemist\" elric is a young alchemical prodigy. he is the youngest state alchemist ever to be recognized by the amestris state military, having received the title at the age of 12. ed's primary motivation throughout the series is to return his younger brother, alphonse, to his original body, which was lost in a failed human transmutation. edward, despite his occasional bouts of immaturity, is a selfless boy who gains a reputation as a \"hero of the people\" throughout his youth. notably, he doesn't seem concerned about returning his own arm and leg, instead focusing entirely on al's suffering.\
 \
 edward is small for his age, standing at only 149 cm (4'11\"), however his body is that of an experienced martial artist, with noticeable muscles and a wealth of agility. although he lacks both his right arm and left leg, ed's ability to fight is not impaired, and is in fact improved, as he will often use alchemy to cause his metal arm to partly transform into a blade or shield. his heavy automail limbs are considered by him to be the very best in amestris. they were made by his childhood friend, winry rockbell, and she is constantly working on them. he is able to think quickly, even in desperate situations, though can still be frightened into paralysis. these qualities, combined with his alchemical powers and physical strength, make him a formidable fighter.\
 \
 born to trisha elric and van hohenheim of resembool in the winter of 1899, edward's first few years were relatively happy; but after the sudden departure of his father during the lad's formative years, ed was left with his mother and younger brother alphonse as his only family. the three elrics lived in peace in the rural village and the boys began displaying a remarkable talent for alchemy at a young age, much to the joyful astonishment of his mother. however, early in the year 1904, trisha contracted an illness that had been spreading in the area and died, leaving her two sons orphaned. even while mourning, mired in grief, edward vowed to his brother that the two of them would find a way to bring their dear mother back to life with the power of alchemy.\
 \
 edward and alphonse spent the next few years living on their own in the elric family home, supported by their close childhood friend winry rockbell and her grandmother pinako, and pursuing the alchemical knowledge necessary for their planned resurrection. although they had gained a great deal of information and comprehension regarding the extended basics of the craft, before long it became apparent to the young prodigies that there was only so far they could go while being self-taught. in a stroke of good fortune, resembool was visited by an exceptionally skilled alchemist named izumi curtis who, after some persuasion, agreed to take the elric brothers on as her apprentices provided they pass a preliminary test. after they do, the elric brothers were subjected to izumi's intensive alchemy and martial arts training, growing significantly in both mind and body and gaining a great deal of alchemical knowledge before returning to resembool. \
 \
 though instructed specifically by izumi to understand that death is an irreversible part of the flow of the world and that acceptance of such is important to the \"one is all, all is one\" concept, the boys dove headlong into their plan to resurrect their mother upon their homecoming, having advanced their knowledge while abroad and discovered the basics to a forbidden practice called human transmutation.\
 \
 devising a human transmutation circle, amassing the elemental ingredients for an adult human body and offering their own blood as soul and biological data, the boys secretly initiated the human transmutation in their home. unfortunately, the human transmutation resulted in a rebound.\
 \
 alphonse and edward were pulled into the gate. encountering the mysterious being called truth, edward was stripped of his left leg in exchange for crossing into god's domain and peeking at the gate's vast wealth of alchemical knowledge. maimed and bleeding, edward was returned to the human dimension to find that alphonse had not yet returned from his disappearance into the gate, that the mother they had attempted to revive was a grotesque mass of organs only capable of sustaining life for a few moments and that his own sojourn into the gate had granted him the curious ability to perform transmutations merely by clapping his hands together, without the aid of a transmutation circle - in the same style used by izumi. desperate to at least have his brother by his side, edward willfully performed another human transmutation to call him back, this time sacrificing his right arm in exchange for al's soul, which he bound alchemically to an antique suit of armor with a blood rune before passing out from severe blood loss. alphonse carried ed to the rockbell house, where a shocked pinako and winry performed emergency surgery to save the young boy's life.\

 he has the homunculus ability, \"the ultimate eye\", which allows him to see the outcome of any situation before it happens and act accordingly.  his ultimate eye can even see transmutations in action and disrupt them with his saber. perhaps, even more dangerous than his ultimate eyes is his inhumane swordsmanship capable of defeating tanks, tons of soldiers, greed, scar, ling, isaac, bucaneer, fu and basically every character that face him in battle. despite this, he states that his age has rusted his agility and power, so his true powers when he was young far surpass the unimaginalble.\
 \
 <b>in the 2003 anime series;</b>\
 the f&uuml;hrer maintains his role as the president of the country. although he is a carefree man, he has a mind like a steel trap and his personality can change rapidly. it was he who finished the ishval civil war by sending in the state alchemists to end it.\
 \
 bradley is revealed to be the homunculus pride. he was created by dante as the fourth homunculus in existence. he was made the president of the country by dante to keep an eye on things. despite his power, it is never known why he did not rebel against dante and take charge of things, but it is possible his loyalty had something to do with it. bradley made edward elric the fullmetal alchemist, and in secret made sloth his secretary, under the guise of juliet douglas.\
 \
 <b>in the manga and 2009 anime series;</b>\
 he has a slightly strange sense of humor and has a habit of doing rather odd things for someone of his status. such things as joking with his subordinates, dressing-up as a tourist while visiting dublith to meet izumi curtis, giving watermelons as gifts to edward elric, ditching work to meet the brothers in the hospital, and jumping out of a window to get away from his attendants. \
 \
 different from the first series, bradley is the homunculus wrath. he was originally one candidate amongst hundreds in a secret program created by father and the amestrian military to find the perfect ruler of amestris. the process involved training already physically fit young men to their peak, then injecting a philosopher's stone from father's body into their candidate. he was the first to survive the process, becoming the first homunculus with the ability to age and was given the name king bradley. unlike other homunculi, he is unable to regenerate and heal himself. he quickly rose to the position of f&uuml;hrer through his battle prowess and apparent dedication to the military ideals of amestris. \
 \
 he is also scornful of the idea of fealty or sacrificing ones life for others believing only that the strong should survive and that the loss of one life can only be balanced by the loss of another. \

 he has the homunculus ability, \"the ultimate eye\", which allows him to see the outcome of any situation before it happens and act accordingly.  his ultimate eye can even see transmutations in action and disrupt them with his saber. perhaps, even more dangerous than his ultimate eyes is his inhumane swordsmanship capable of defeating tanks, tons of soldiers, greed, scar, ling, isaac, bucaneer, fu and basically every character that face him in battle. despite this, he states that his age has rusted his agility and power, so his true powers when he was young far surpass the unimaginalble.\
 \
 <b>in the 2003 anime series;</b>\
 the f&uuml;hrer maintains his role as the president of the country. although he is a carefree man, he has a mind like a steel trap and his personality can change rapidly. it was he who finished the ishval civil war by sending in the state alchemists to end it.\
 \
 bradley is revealed to be the homunculus pride. he was created by dante as the fourth homunculus in existence. he was made the president of the country by dante to keep an eye on things. despite his power, it is never known why he did not rebel against dante and take charge of things, but it is possible his loyalty had something to do with it. bradley made edward elric the fullmetal alchemist, and in secret made sloth his secretary, under the guise of juliet douglas.\
 \
 <b>in the manga and 2009 anime series;</b>\
 he has a slightly strange sense of humor and has a habit of doing rather odd things for someone of his status. such things as joking with his subordinates, dressing-up as a tourist while visiting dublith to meet izumi curtis, giving watermelons as gifts to edward elric, ditching work to meet the brothers in the hospital, and jumping out of a window to get away from his attendants. \
 \
 different from the first series, bradley is the homunculus wrath. he was originally one candidate amongst hundreds in a secret program created by father and the amestrian military to find the perfect ruler of amestris. the process involved training already physically fit young men to their peak, then injecting a philosopher's stone from father's body into their candidate. he was the first to survive the process, becoming the first homunculus with the ability to age and was given the name king bradley. unlike other homunculi, he is unable to regenerate and heal himself. he quickly rose to the position of f&uuml;hrer through his battle prowess and apparent dedication to the military ideals of amestris. \
 \
 he is also scornful of the idea of fealty or sacrificing ones life for others believing only that the strong should survive and that the loss of one life can only be balanced by the loss of another. \

 \
 it is later revealed that selim is not bradley's biological son, but rather adopted from a distant relative and, specifically in brotherhood, he is revealed as the homunculus known as pride. \
 \
 pride is the first homunculus that father created. he is the most powerful of the homunculi and seemingly the highest ranked, as he is seen giving orders to sloth and envy. thus, he is generally respected by the others. he is extremely cruel, heartlessly ruthless and extremely devoted to father's cause. he refers to his enemies as \"mister (plus a nickname)\" in mocking respect and often makes big smiles and casual talks before attacking. he has also proven himself to be quite clever and resourceful. his attacks mainly center around manipulating shadows, which is convenient, because it's virtually impossible to eliminate one's shadow.\

 <b>in the 2003 anime series:</b>\
 as the oldest homunculus, envy claimed that he had forgotten what he originally looked like. envy also greatly hates all humans and followed dante mostly for the opportunity of killing as many people as he could. this is what drove envy in all that he did and unlike other homunculi, envy does not care about the philosopher's stone, nor about becoming human.\
 \
 towards the very end of the series it is revealed that envy was created four hundred years ago by hohenheim in an attempt to resurrect the son he and dante had, who later died from mercury poisoning when he was eighteen years old. envy held a great hatred toward hohenheim for never being acknowledged as his son and for abandoning him and dante.\
 <b>in the manga and 2009 anime series:</b>\
 envy was the fourth homunculus created by father. though often referred to as a 'he' envy is apparently genderless and can take almost any form they choose. referred to by lust as the most cruel or sadistic of the homunculi, envy shows the most open disdain of humans and relishes in any opportunity to hurt, humiliate, or insult them. they are also quite vain and short tempered and dislike anyone insulting their appearance.\
 \
 beneath this cruel exterior however envy is secretly envious of humans' inner strength and the mutually beneficial friendships that they share, since most of the homunculi show little real concern or emotional support for each other.\

 in the fullmetal alchemist manga he is refered to as \"van hohenheim,\" not hohenheim elric. as edward elric points out in book 14 of the fullmetal alchemist manga, \"elric is my mother's name!\"\
 he (in the original 2003 anime)...\
  \
 has been alive for centuries. he worked in a lab, which took advantage of 'witch trials' as human bait, to create the first philosopher's stone. he succeeded, but it cost him his life. dante, (his lover at the moment) attached his soul (much like al to armor) to the nearest man in the room, reviving hohenheim. they continued this practice for many years, until hohenheim fell in love and married trisha elric. after they sired edward and alphonse, he left for fear dante would use them against him, and also because he felt ashamed of his past. like dante, his flesh is wearing away, so he must wear cologne to mask the scent. he can transmute without circles, because when he died, he saw past the gate, as did dante.\

 he was initially given a philosopher's stone made of ishvalan souls, but when the army tried to confiscate it after the war was over, he swallowed it whole. throughout the series, he is seen making himself choke it back up to get a good look at it.\

 <b>in the 2003 anime series;</b>\
 like her manga counterpart, she is highly intelligent, manipulative, and devoted to her own ideals; however, she begins to crave becoming a human as the series progresses. her main purposes amongst the homunculi are gathering information, and traveling to manipulate alchemists into creating philosopher's stones. gaining true humanity is the focal point of her ambition, arguably much more so than the rest of the homunculi.\
 \
 lust was created by scar's brother, when he attempted to use alchemy to bring his lover back from the dead. after he was cast out from ishbalan society as a heretic, envy visited the wretched creature and fed it red stones, giving her human shape, and her new name. she was not the first homunculus to bear the name of lust, and is the third youngest homunculus.\
 <b>in the manga and 2009 anime series;</b>\
 lust is the only female homunculus and the second to be created by father. due to her high intelligence and devotion to father's plan, lust appears to have a great deal of free reign and authority within the organization, seeming to have a position second only to pride and on par with wrath. lust also has a great disdain for humans, thinking them frail, predictable and generally stupid. moreover, she appears to take pleasure in using and throwing them away. lust is the first to introduce the idea of homunculi as superhuman, the next wave of evolution of humanity, and takes pride in her nature.\

 \
 a childhood friend of the central characters, the elric brothers, she is often seen in their company throughout the series. she is evidently edward's love interest. specializing in mechanical repair, specifically with automail, winry services edward's arm and leg whenever it is in need of repair or replacement.\
 \
 in the manga, winry becomes an apprentice to garfiel, an automail engineer in rush valley. she also studies techniques for making automail for northern frigid conditions. her parents, both doctors, were killed by scar during the ishbal war when she was very young. in chapter 47 at the central, she tried to shoot scar after finding out that he was the one who had killed her parents.\
 \
 she frequently travels with the elrics in earlier chapters and later, returning back to rush valley, realizes that she has been in love with ed for a long time, and ed has the same feeling though he constantly denies it.\
 \
 it has been mentioned in chapter 15 that alphonse and edward had once fought over who would get to marry winry when they were kids, making ed freak out and become incredibly flustered, claiming that he didn't remember that. alphonse won, but was rejected. after ed asked her why, she replied with \"i don't like guys shorter than me,\" resulting in a huge blow on ed's ego.\
 \
 due to her importance in the lives of the elric brothers, winry is used as a hostage by the military to gain edward's obedience. in order to escape from the military possession, she decided to travel with scar and the others. it was revealed in chapter 73 that it was her plan for scar to use her as a hostage in order to escape although she has not forgiven him for killing her parents. in chapter 84 winry is taken on a military train back into resembool in a water tank. when she goes into her house, she is shocked to find ed in her room while she is undressing. they both scream which causes everyone to believe that the two of them are in danger. shortly afterwards (after beating his head a few times), she fills ed in on where al is and what have been happening in lior. ed tells her to leave the country, but she refuses, wanting to help ed in any way that she can. ed soon departs, and winry stays in resembool for the time being.\
 \
 at the epilogue, ed confesses (or maybe more like proposes) to her, and in a photo, it shown that they're married and have two children.\

 piccolo is a fictional character from the dragon ball metaseries. he is considered both the son and reincarnation of demon king piccolo and was spawned to save himself from certain death at the hands of son goku. like his father, he appears as a tall green humanoid creature with pointy ears; he is later revealed to be part of an alien race known as the namekians. \
 \
 piccolo is first consumed with revenge against goku, and elects to defeat and kill him during the 23rd budokai tenkaichi. after his narrow defeat against goku, piccolo is soon forced to form an at first uneasy alliance with goku and his friends against newer, more dangerous threats like the saiyans and freeza. out of necessity he also takes it upon himself to train goku's child son gohan, forming a bond which is strengthened when he sacrifices himself to save the child's life against nappa. after his resurrection, he fully joins goku and the others in their struggles against ever more powerful villains.\
 \
 piccolo still retains elements of ruthlessness and cockiness, but once he fuses with kami, all traces of evil and hate disappear, and piccolo is completely reborn as a pure soul. piccolo remains a loner, preferring to stand apart from others. he has little to say unless it involves battle, but he normally can still retain his stoic and calm personality in everyday, normal situations. piccolo has shown to have intelligence, such as when he gathered strength to regenerate his arm after cell had drained it, or when he elected to kill babidi since he knew leaving him alive wouldn't solve the problem of buu. his intelligence is even picked up on buu, who later absorbs him for his fine brain.\
 \
 piccolo's character development entails him changing from a villain hell-bent on revenge on goku and controlling the world to becoming a better person who is capable of caring about other people, like gohan and goku. he's also showed some interest in learning about his namekian heritage, and has a good affinity with kids, as he trained gohan for a year, helped goten and trunks to learn fusion\
 and is even seen humorously rocking pan to sleep in <i>fukkatsu no f</i>. he also acts as a confidant for dende, who is a younger namekian and is tasked with watching over earth (piccolo is able to impart the wisdom he gained from fusing with kami, as kami was the previous placeholder of dende's current occupation).\

 originally named kakarot, gokuu is born a member of a race of extraterrestrials called the saiyans. shortly following his birth, gokuu is sent from his native planet vegeta to earth, for potential selling on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life; goku was also sent away to escape freeza's genocide of the saiyans. once he lands on earth, he is adopted by an old man named gohan (who is later just called grandpa gohan). at first, goku is very violent as a kid due to his saiyan blood, but due to an injury to his head that caused him severe amnesia, gokuu changes to a more tempered, innocent boy. at the start of the series, gokuu meets bulma, yamucha, oolong, and pu'ar, whose characters mirror those found in wu cheng'en's journey to the west. he also encounters kuririn, who eventually becomes his best friend, and others during his journey for more strength. participating in several world martial arts tournaments, gokuu also battles foes-turned-allies such as tenshinhan and chaozu, as well as the offspring of demon king piccolo named majunior (later, he's named just piccolo).\
 \
 dragon ball z takes place 5 years after gokuu's victory against piccolo in the 23rd budokai tenkaichi. he now has a son named son gohan (named after grandpa gohan) who lacks his father's love of fighting but has a great hidden potential himself. throughout the series, gokuu & gohan face terribly strong opponents like other powerful saiyans, a space tyrant, artificial humans, majins & gods that threaten earth while also giving them exhilarating fights. along with new enemies, they also gain new friends that help in these situations. as well as becoming more powerful, gokuu learns to accept his forgotten saiyan heritage (this gives him a small identity crisis when raditz reveals his past, and is something he carries with him into the proceeding namek arc) & consistently comes across the predicament of killing an opponent (he starts out killing without much thought to the moral consequences of taking a life, and only after training under kami does he start to struggle with killing a person; this comes to a head when he fights freeza on namek).\
 \
 in <i>dragon ball gt</i>, which is not based on toriyama's manga, gokuu is turned into a child by pilaf via the black-star dragon balls. the series revolves around him traveling around space to find the black star dragon balls with the help of his granddaughter pan and trunks. after collecting the spheres, gokuu does battle with baby (a tuffle who wants revenge on all saiyans for killing his race), super 17 (a powered-up version of former enemy artificial human 17) and various evil dragons (the physical constructs of negative energy accumulated in the dragon balls; they are called shadow dragons in funimation's dub). the series ends with gokuu leaving for good with shenron and returning 100 years later to witness the match between gokuu jr. and vegeta jr.\
 \
 in <i>dragon ball online</i> (which takes place 216 years after <i>dragon ball z</i>, in which toriyama had a lot of creative control over the story, unlike <i>dragon ball gt</i>), a new villain by the name of miira appears with the goal to obtain gokuu's dna.\
 \
 in <i>cross epoch</i>, the <i>dragon ball</i> and <i>one piece</i> crossover one-shot, gokuu is seen accompanying luffy to attend a party hosted by shenron from whom key characters from both series had received an invitation.\
 \
 in <i>dragon ball minus</i>, it is revealed that gokuu was sent away by his mother and father (gine & bardock) to escape freeza's genocide of the saiyans. gokuu leaves planet vegeta in his pod with a forlorn look as his parents send him away.\
 \
 gokuu is known for his laid-back personality and his love of fighting worthy opponents. he will eat anything without much qualms. he has an uncanny ability to make allies out of foes he has fought (in some cases to the death), though his capacity for sparing his enemies has occasionally been criticized as foolish (gokuu generally only fights to win and improve himself, and spares his enemies after winning only for them to attack him when his back is turned). gokuu can also be very blunt, and not afraid to express his opinion in a discussion, such as when he questioned krillin's marriage to android 18 (who was not fully human and a previous enemy who threatened his life). despite his kind-hearted nature, gokuu can feel incredible anger in cases of extreme turmoil, such as the death of a close friend/relative, or when someone murders many innocents needlessly. he has a simple, practical view of the world and is somewhat naive to the world around him. because of this, many characters incorrectly assume him to be somewhat stupid, although once he has a basic understanding of things, he learns very quickly. his most remarkable ability is his will to succeed, his tenacity and persistence.\
 \
 he's so focused on improving himself as a warrior that some of the decisions he makes are detrimental to the survival of humanity or those who he cares about. such examples include when he purposefully chose not to help his friends and family when they were attacked by beerus at bulma's birthday so as to study his opponent, or when he elected not to destroy gero's lab in favor of his curiosity at his potential opponents' strength even though it might've meant the destruction of mankind. this is also touched upon when he spares vegeta for a rematch in the saiyan arc, despite this also being a threat to humanity. however, he has shown to be able to slightly curb this selfishness, as he elected to not return to life after dying in the fight against cell so that earth would not be endangered by the evil people he tends to attract (although, goku is also interested in fighting the masters in the afterlife indicating some slight selfishness was still apparent). \
 \
 goku has also admitted to not being good at creating things, and being better at breaking stuff at the end of <i>dragon ball kai</i>. in <i>dragon ball super</i> ep. 4, goku is revealed not to be much of a party-goer. he has also shown an affinity with training younger kids (like how he did with gohan in the androids arc, goten & trunks in the buu arc, and uub at the end of the series).\

 gohan is a main character in the <i>dragon ball</i> series by akira toriyama and is the dual main character of <i>dragon ball z</i> along with his father, goku.\
 \
 gohan is a shy and studious intellectual, and as a child lacks the fighting spirit that is common among most saiyans. however, because he is forced to protect the ones he loves, he taps into his vast half-breed saiyan potential, becoming one of the most powerful main characters in the series. as an adult, he abandons his superhero duties and uses his mind, as a premier scholar. gohan is extremely powerful, sometimes surpassing gokuu, piccolo and vegeta at certain points in the story.\
 \
 at first, the relationship with piccolo is a frightening one, but after piccolo saves gohan's life from nappa at the cost of his own, piccolo admits his change because of gohan's acceptance of him during the 1 year they were training together. from here on out, piccolo acts as an uncle (oji-san in the japanese version) to gohan. krillin also acted as a strong confidant in gohan, particularly during the namek arc and the beginning of the buu arc.\
 \
 gohan also shares a strong relationship with his father in gokuu, citing his walking up to freeza on namek as a source of inspiration and strength. he also spends to close to a full year just with him in the room of spirit and time during the androids arc, and the two really get to enjoy each other's company. gohan's respect and love for his father is all the more shown when he elects to wear goku's orange gi when he sets off to fight buu.\
 \
 his hobbies are reading, fishing, and researching scholarly subjects. though he claims he does not share the love of fighting gokuu has, gohan does feel obligated to help when danger arrives. he also enjoys being a hero, as seen by his comedic and unimpressive great saiyaman stunt. another prominent facet of his personality was the fear of his own great potential power, which was seen when he was afraid that he might kill cell during their battle in the androids arc.\

 vegeta is a fictional character from the manga series dragon ball, created by akira toriyama.\
 \
 along with goku, gohan and piccolo, he is one of the most prominent characters in the series, originally starting out as a villain before becoming a mainstay hero.\
 \
 vegeta starts out haughty, arrogant, self-entitled and ruthless as the prince of saiyans. his royal status caused him to develop an inflated sense of superiority and he holds himself above most, if not all people he encounters. regal, egotistical and full of pride, vegeta was once a ruthless, cold-blooded warrior and outright killer. however, as the story unfolds, he changes to a person capable of caring about and loving someone other than himself.\
 \
 vegeta was once a young member of the saiyan army, but after his race's demise, he worked alongside nappa and raditz, directly under freeza. he seeks immortality to rule the universe, but once he learns about freeza destroying his planet from dodoria, he resolves to take out freeza (not to avenge his race, but to assure his own rule over the universe as well as to get back at freeza for unknowingly using him to further his own goals). he later battles freeza with the main cast on namek and dies in the ensuing fights; once he is revived, he returns to earth, where he adjusts to everyday life and remains there for good.\
 \
 in <i>cross epoch</i> (the <i>dragon ball</i> and <i>one piece</i> crossover one-shot) vegeta is the captain of an air ship and is seen wearing an eye patch and a cape with a clasp featuring the kanji character for \"vegetable.\" trunks, usopp and nico robin are members of his crew.\

 the biological father of raditz and son goku, burdock is a saiyan who is given the gift of precognition. in several of his recurring visions, he witnesses the destruction of his home planet vegeta by the hand of freeza. after escaping certain death from dodoria, he tries desperately to change his planet's grim future by attempting to combat freeza and his legion of men head on. he ultimately fails on ceasing freeza's attack on the planet and is killed in the process. moments before his death, he received a vision of his son facing the warlord. according to the anime special, burdock was estimated a battle power of 10,000 by observant doctors while recovering from his last mission.  \

 bulma is originally a secondary main character, but her role is quickly downplayed as the series continues, even though she does remain an important support character for most of the series. bulma is a direct parody of the character xuanzang from the chinese novel journey to the west. even though bulma's character parodies a monk, her japanese name \"buruma\" is the brand of a popular gym short worn by girls in japan. her re-adapted name bulma is a direct take on the word \"bloomers\", which was a popular brand of women's underwear in the early 20th century.\
 \
 bulma is the second character to be introduced in the dragon ball series. in the early part of the story, she is the inventor of the dragon radar and is searching for the legendary dragon balls. bulma was hoping to use the dragon balls to wish for the perfect boyfriend. while searching for a nearby dragon ball, she runs into son goku. it is at this time that she finds out goku inherited one of the balls (the four-star ball) she is searching for from his grandpa gohan. because of goku's love for the ball and his belief that his grandpa's spirit lives in the ball, goku is not willing to give it up. bulma then asks him to loan it for her in exchange of taking him in her travels. at that point, they team up to find the remainder of the balls and the adventure begins. in the later action-oriented episodes of the series, there is little room for a genius but bulma continues to play a role as a secondary character, helping goku and his friends with her gadgets, and having a rather rocky relationship with yamcha.\

 he fights gohan in both his normal and super saiyan forms to gather energy for buu, but before they can finish, he notices vegeta has evil within him. during the fight vegeta shows great frustration which comes from the fact that gohan has to make an effort to kill dabura even though gohan is still more powerful than dabura. this spawns from the fact gohan has not trained at all in the past 7 years and is only slightly more than half as strong as he was when he fought perfect cell. this allows babidi to grant him power. when buu is released, dabura tries to kill him, but is turned into a cookie and devoured by buu. (upon his death in the anime, king yamma decides that the usual punishment of exile to hell is what dabura would actually desire, so he instead sends him to the most peaceful region of heaven.) in the anime, dabura is later seen wandering as a \"good-spirited\" soul consumed with love (creeping out anyone who meets him).\
 it is mentioned by goku that dabura's power is equal to perfect cell's.  \

 frieza is introduced in the series as the powerful galactic overlord on a mission for immortality and conquest, ruler of an empire said to control seventy-nine or more planets. frieza creates armies from the planets that he conquers, his most utilized race were the saiyans. frieza had heard about the legend of the super saiyan, a being with unrivaled power, but dismissed it as simple mythology; however, after several saiyans emerged with rapidly evolving potential, frieza began to fear that the legend would indeed come true, so as a result, destroyed the saiyan race. his actions and lust for power eventually bring him into conflict with the heroes of the series when he tries to take possession of the wish-granting dragon balls on planet namek. \
 \
 frieza's fears were realized when he was defeated by goku, who in turn had become a super saiyan.\
 \
 his character would return shortly thereafter, having survived the encounter with goku but having been left with multiple metal prosthetics. though accompanied to earth by his father, frieza is unable to avenge his loss, being killed with relative ease by a newcomer to the series, the half-saiyan time traveler trunks. a blood sample taken before his ultimate fate would later become a catalyst for the next arc's featured villain: cell, a warrior genetically engineered to be perfect.\
 \
 after frieza's death, he was kept imprisoned in hell, with the angels of hell being the ones who were tasked with ensuring that he remained captive. during his time in hell frieza retained his mecha frieza state and was left trapped inside a cocoon. \
 over 14 years after frieza's demise, his two elite soldiers sorbet and tagoma collect all of the dragon balls and resurrect him, and he is revived as he was just before his death, as mecha frieza and in pieces. sorbet and tagoma collect all of the pieces of frieza and put the organic parts in a healing chamber, frieza's body is regenerated and he reverts himself back into his first form.\
 \
 frieza believes that through four months of serious training, he will be able to reach a level of power high enough to wipe out the saiyans in the blink of an eye.\
 \
 toei animation would continue to make use of the character in their anime adaptation, with frieza making brief cameo appearances during the buu saga, animated features and dragon ball gt. he is last referenced in the manga as a measure of the strength of the kaioshin, the supreme lords of the dragon ball universe, as \"each of whom could have felled frieza in one blow\". in toriyama's out-of-continuity parody of his earlier work neko majin z, frieza sends his henchman vegeta on errand to retrieve his missing son on earth.\

 even though he is the teacher of the greatest warriors in the universe, grand kai is more of a sweet and a kind grandfatherly figure than a traditional disciplinarian (much like north kai and master roshi). paying no heed to respectful-but-cold formality, he lovingly treats his social-inferiors as equals and dotes on them as if they were his own grandchildren.\

 though guru is not shown fighting in the series, he has shown a number of abilities. as a member of the dragon clan, his most famous ability is the power to create dragon balls, to which he gave powerful abilities. he has the ability to unlock someone's hidden potential by placing his hand on their head; he did this for krillin, gohan and dende.\

 originally a human, he is constructed into a cyborg by dr. gero like his twin sister. 17 is a mass murderer in future trunks' timeline.\
 \
 number 17 is not an android created by dr. gero. he and his twin sister #18, were once human. how could they be twins if they weren't once human? toriyama said gero found them as a couple of hooligans. they existed before dr. gero, therefore, they are not robots. an android is a robot and a cyborg is a human with robot parts in them. considering what he can do, #17 is probably about half human.\
 \
 now as to the motivation behind #17 killing dr. gero, that's subjective. while they didn't necessarily like being turned into cyborgs, once it was done, it couldn't be undone. it was dr. gero's strangle hold on their freedom, as represented by the \"controller\" device, that inspired #17 to kill him. threat + rebel = dead gero. they were both rebels. you should never try to put a leash on a rebel.\
 \
 later, #17 and #18 drive around in a van with android 16, looking for goku. when they finally get to the kame house, piccolo tells them goku is not there. he refuses to tell them where he went to, and thus piccolo challes #17 to a battle. as they fight, piccolo's ki leads cell (an evil insect freak spawned by dr. gero's computer who needs to absorb #17 and #18 to reach its perfect form) to the battlefield. he offers #17 to surrender so he can become a part of *greatness*. #17 refuses, and is defeated during the battle.\
 \
 number 17 is killed when cell explodes, but is wished back to life along with the other people on earth who had been killed by cell. #17 has his explosive device removed by kuririn with the second wish. the last time we see #17 in dbz is when he is in the woods donating energy for goku's genki-dama. considering the fact that he is alive during the kid buu saga serves as a testament to his good soul: the wish that revived him was one that vegeta made asking for only the good people on earth to be revived when it was restored (kid buu had previously obliterated the planet in a single attack).\
 \
 he later returns as one of the ten members of the universe 7 team in dragon ball super,  and ends up sacrificing himself to hold back jiren. \

 after cell is defeated, kuririn uses the dragon balls to wish for #17 and #18 to be turned into humans; shenlong is unable to perform this task because of the unfathomable differences in power between him and the duo, so he wishes instead for their self destruct devices to be removed. kuririn pursues #18 and, at some point, they marry and have a daughter named marron.\
 \

 king vegeta is only seen in the anime special, the film broly: the legendary super saiyan, and in some original scenes in the anime series. his appearance is never shown nor described in the manga, but he is mentioned briefly in a dialogue from freeza to vegeta in the original manga.\

 even though he has never directly saved the world he is highly responsible for defeating kid buu as he convinced everyone on earth to give power to goku's genki dama, along with his direct role in defeating majin buu. a common point of humor after his first appearance in the cell saga is his extremely inflated ego, arrogance and craving for the spotlight which the z fighters find annoying at best. interestingly enough, he never lost any world tournament that he attended in the series, nor has he died, making him one of the few characters not to have done so along with pan, his granddaughter. he has a daughter named videl who dates/marries son gohan. a reference to this is made in the video games dragon ball z: budokai tenkaichi 2 and budokai tenkaichi 3. if the player matches adult son gohan and mr. satan the opening dialogue starts with mr. satan saying \"if you want to go out with my daughter, you'll have to go through me!\" gohan replies, \"wait, it's not like that!\" the fight then begins.\

 pan is a fictional character in the manga and anime series dragon ball z, as well as dragon ball gt. she is a human-saiyajin quarter breed. in the original japanese version, she was voiced by yuko minaguchi, while she is voiced by elise baughman in the funimation dub and by caitlynne medrek in the blue water studios redubs. it should be noted that pan's name comes from the pan of roman (as well as others) mythology. that means that, at first glance, she appears to have been named after her mother videl rather than her father gohan. however, closer inspection reveals a double-pun on behalf of author akira toriyama, in that pan is also the japanese and spanish word for bread, continuing her father's food-based name as well as her mother's god-religion-based name.\
 \
 pan is introduced in the series following the ten year interval between the defeat of majin buu and the end of the written dragon ball series. in the series, pan is daughter of the primary character named son gohan, and as a result, the granddaughter of the main character named son goku. pan is the only original character in the series with the most diluted saiyajin heritage, and as a result, it was stated in the daizenshuu that she didn't have the ability to become a super saiyajin. however, this is later contradicted by the dragon ball gt perfect file books that stated that she could have ascended if she trained hard enough. it was also stated by toriyama that the simple reason to pan's inability to become a super saiyajin was that he could not come up with a logical design for a female super saiyajin; being that most of the super saiyajin traits are typical of males, and not females.\
 \
 as pan only appears for three chapters in the manga, her later life is elaborated on in the anime-only series called dragon ball gt, where she is seen as a young girl who travels the galaxy with her grandfather goku, and trunks, the half-saiyajin son of the characters vegeta and bulma. in the final episode of dragon ball gt, pan is seen as an old woman, being over 100 years old. she is the grandmother to the character named son goku jr., who has the ability to become a super saiyajin. this contridicts the daizenshuu that stated that characters who possessed less then half-saiyajin heritage did not have the ability to become super saiyajins because of diluted blood-lines.\

 piccolo daimao came into being some 300 years before the beginning of dragon ball sometime after a powerful namekian on earth attempted to\

 pu'ar has the unique ability to shapeshift into any form, even inanimate objects, and can hold that form for as long as desired; though strength is not increased by the change, however, as such is unable to turn into something that can be used up like fuel or food. pu'ar graduated from the same shapeshifting academy as oolong, although unlike oolong, pu'ar had completed all of the academy training and does not have oolong's difficulties with maintaining a transformed state. pu'ar shows up quite a bit in the beginning, but becomes less of a presence as the series continues. as the driving theme of the series is mostly about fighting, pu'ar can do little more than react to the horrors of the latest supervillains in the story.\
 \
 there is some debate regarding the character's gender. despite being portrayed by several female voice actors, the character has been referred to with both male and female pronouns during the anime. though the issue of gender is never directly addressed, toriyama has referred to pu'ar as \"he\" while answering a fan question in the \"ask me anything\" section in the back of the manga. some fans believe that since shape-shifters can assume many different forms, gender is a moot point.\

 \
 in <i>dragon ball online</i> (which takes place 216 years after dragon ball z, and unlike dragon ball gt, toriyama had a lot of creative control over the story), it is stated that in 800 age, goten, along with present day trunks had created the kikoukenjutsu sword school\

 he is brought back by uranai baba during the fortuneteller baba saga to make a point to goku that he needs to train harder and make his tail work for him instead of against him. he also appears in the filler mini-saga \"the wedding arc\" where he is an assistant to annin and goku must use the magical furnace to put out the fire on ox king's castle. \

 mittermeyer ordered the execution of one of his subordinates for assaulting, robbing and murdering a civilian woman. although his decision was just, he turned out to belong to a powerful noble family and mittermeyer was soon arrested. while the nobles plotted his death, desperate to save his only friend reuenthal met with reinhard von m&uuml;sel (later lohengramm) and offered his and mittermeyer&rsquo;s loyalty to him, in exchange for aid in saving mittermeyer from the nobility and clearing his name. reinhard, who had his own well-known issues with the nobles, readily accepted and both of them were transferred under his command. \

 count reinhard von lohengramm is a young admiral in the galactic empire.\

 he was born reinhard von m&uuml;sel to an impoverished aristocratic family. his mother died when he was very young and he only has faint memories of her. his father's will was shattered at about the same time and the only person left to care for young reinhard was his beloved older sister annerose. when reinhard was about ten years old, his family had to move into a middle class suburban neighborhood. there he met siegfried kircheis who would become his best and perhaps only friend, but whatever happiness reinhard managed to find as a child was to be short-lived. \
 \
 the emperor friedrich iv took a liking to his sister and ordered her to move into his palace and become his new concubine. afraid that if she refused she would bring down the emperor's wrath on her younger brother, annerose reluctantly accepted and her father even managed to get some money out of it. infuriated reinhard swore vengeance against the emperor, vengeance against the goldenbaum dynasty and vengeance against the oppressive nobility. he swore that he would never rest until he freed his sister of her predicament and became powerful enough never to be ordered by anyone again. \
 \
 to achieve his goals and with kircheis by his side, reinhard joined the military. he quickly rose through the ranks and after proving his ability time and again to the hostile and corrupt nobility, ever reluctant to accept a fallen aristocrat like him into their ranks, he became an imperial high admiral and was elevated to peerage as the \"count of lohengramm\". as he steps into the admiralty, the emperor gives him the prototype battleship br&uuml;nhild, which serves as reinhards flagship from then on.\

 nicknamed \"blonde brat\" by his enemies and \"golden lion\" by his friends, reinhard is a handsome and gifted individual, a superb tactician and an unequaled strategist. brave and noble, he always leads his fleets from the front, much to the admiration, as well as the horror, of his subordinates. ambitious and determined, reinhard is only hindered by his immeasurable pride, his warlike nature and the turmoil in his heart.\

 hildegard von mariendorf is one of the principal characters in the series. she served as the new galactic fleet's chief advisor she later reigned with reinhard von lohengramm when she became his wife and empress in u.c. 801.\
 \
 hildegard, usually referred to by the nickname hilda, was born in galactic year 777 into an distinguished noble family of the goldenbaum dynasty, the sole daughter of the benevolent and just count franz von mariendorf. from an early age, she was distinguished from the other girls of the aristocrat society by her independent ideas. completely unconcerned, hilda pursued her own interests in reading, politics and history. her mother having died when hilda was young, her open-minded father respected hilda's unique ideas and choices in life.\
 \
 in u.c. 797, the old galactic empire spilt into civil war, where the old nobility stood against the new emerging camp of military elites lead by reinhard von lohengramm. hilda convinced her father to plea allegiance to the latter, whereupon she met reinhard for the first time and impressed him with the clarity of her insight. when the lohengramm camp emerged victorious from the civil war, reinhard gained complete political and military power in the empire, and hilda became reinhard's chief secretary and assisted him in the progressive reforms that swept across the empire.\
 \
 from u.c. 798 to u.c. 800, hilda played an active role on the galactic stage, advising reinhard wisely on imperial policies and tactics, and became one of his most valued and trusted staff. during operation ragnar&ouml;k, where the empire battled the alliance, hilda served as a staff officer and became the first female to board the flagship br&uuml;nhild. during the critical battle of vermillion, she perceived that the situation was in reinhard's disfavour, and persuaded generals mittermeyer and reuentahl to mobilize forces against the alliance capital, turning the war to reinhard's tactical victory and saving his life. general mittermeyer later praised hilda that \"her intelligence is worth more than a fleet.\" her role gradually became more public after reinhard's coronation as the first emperor of the new lohengramm dynasty. \
 \
 in the year u.c. 800, in the ninth battle of iserlohn, hilda succeeded general steinmetz to become the fleet's chief advisor, formally capable of representing the emperor and command on his behalf on the battlefield. conscious of her military position, hilda withheld her political role and refused to advise reinhard on political matters, despite his repeated requests for her counsel.\
 \
 in august of u.c. 800, reinhard was attacked by an assassin who sought vengeance for reinhard's inaction in the westland tragedy. overcame with regret and emotional agony, reinhard withdrew into his own quarters and hilda entered to console him. subconsciously realizing that his reliance on her has deepened past their professional relationship, he asked her to stay, and she agreed, determined to help him to the best of her abilities. the morning after, reinhard came to hilda's home and proposed marriage, and hilda did not immediately reply for the uncertainty whether she can truly give him happiness. she also did not reveal her pregnancy to him until after the urvashi affair and reuentahl's subsequent rebellion, which deepened the insight of both hilda and reinhard toward their own feelings. when peace was restored, hilda accepted reinhard's second proposal, and they were married on january 19, u.c. 801. the officials of the empire greeted their new empress with enthusiasm and joy. on may the 14th, while reinhard was away at war, hilda give birth to a son, whom reinhard named alexander siegfried von lohengramm. reinhard's illness seriously exacerbated a mere sixteen days later and was diagnosed with a rare form mutative connective tissue disease, with no know cure. despite the illness, reinhard decided to return to the imperial capital for the sake of the people awaiting him there. on july the 18th, reinhard and hilda were re-united. on july the 26th, the dying reinhard said his final words to hilda: \"my empress, you shall rule the universe more wisely than i. if you think setting up a constitution is the better way then so be it. the universe would be fine as long as the strongest and wisest among all the living governs it. if alexander seigfried lacks that ability, there is no need for lohengramm dynasty to continue. do everything as you wish; that is my greatest wish...\" he died at the age of twenty-five, with their son succeeding him and hilda ruling as the empress dowager. she was remembered by later historians as the person who nurtured the lohengramm empire to maturity.\

 oskar von reuenthal is a rear admiral serving in reinhard&rsquo;s fleet and, along with wolfgang mittermeyer, reinhard&rsquo;s ablest field commander. \
 \
 reuenthal was born to a lowly, but rich noble father and a mother from a distinguished but impoverished line that only married his father for his material affluence. reuenthal was born with a rare condition called heterochromia, one of his eyes is blue, while the other is brown. since both his parents had blue eyes, this was seen as proof of his mother&rsquo;s adultery. his mother committed suicide after trying to pluck out his brown eye while he was still an infant. reuenthal&rsquo;s father put the blame on him and he grew up hated and neglected. \
 \
 reuenthal joined the military and rose through the ranks rather quickly, finding in war the reason he needed to keep on living. while stationed in fortress iserlohn, he met wolfgang mittermeyer and the two became close friends. mittermeyer is probably the only person reuenthal has managed to have a normal relationship with and he greatly values their friendship. when mittermeyer was unjustly detained and in danger of assassination by the nobility, reuenthal didn&rsquo;t hesitate to pledge his loyalty to reinhard in return for his help with mittermeyer&rsquo;s case. \
 \
 reuenthal appears calm and composed on the outside, he is a brilliant war strategist, second only to reinhard, and an accomplished tactician, but reuenthal is, in reality, a ticking bomb ready to go off at any moment and perhaps would have already exploded if not for mittermeyer&rsquo;s soothing presence in his life.  his problematic childhood has ridden him with an incredible amount of self-loathing and a complete inability to trust women, though handsome and successful with the opposite sex, he never manages to get into a healthy relationship. proud and ambitious reuenthal often contemplates treachery, but his respect towards reinhard and the debt he owes him, manage to restrain him. his flagship is the tristan. \

          description = "birthdate: april 4, 767 u.c. \
 yang wenli is a commodore, currently serving in the 2nd fleet of the free planets alliance.\
 \
 the son of a merchant and a pacifist at heart, yang never wanted to be a soldier; his dream was to become a historian, but he didn't have the money to pay for his tuition and joined the army to get a scholarship. he barely made it through the officer's academy due to his lack of interest, though he did make a number of friends there including dusty attenborough and jean robert lap. he also met music student jessica edwards and both him and lap developed a crush on her, jessica eventually chose lap, yang accepted her decision and they remained friends.\
 \
 soon after he graduated, yang became involved in a battle near the friendly planet el facil, because of his superiors' incompetence and cowardice, the planet was abandoned while a hostile imperial fleet was on its way. yang was one of the few officers that remained behind and tried to help the population, thanks to his efforts the planet was evacuated in time. because of this achievement he became famous as \"the hero of el facil\" and \"miracle yang,\" forever earning the envy of his peers and the scorn of his superiors.\
 \
 it was at el facil that yang first became interested in tactics, but ever since that incident and although he kept rising through the ranks, his novel tactical suggestions were being arbitrarily rejected by hostile superiors. though disappointed and increasingly cynical with the state of affairs in the alliance, yang never stopped trying to do at least the absolute minimum to justify his salary and the pension he was so looking forward to.\
 \
 miracle yang, also called \"the magician,\" is a genius tactician, as well as a competent strategist. unlike his often proud adversaries, yang is more than willing to resort to trickery and his only flaw as a commander lies with his inability to go against the orders of his superiors. yang holds democracy in an extremely high esteem and has a well-defined political philosophy, providing much insight to anyone willing to listen to him. in his personal life he appears to be quite slothful, he is notoriously incompetent with house chores, as well as in all things romantic. after serving on the patorokolos in the start of the series, yang eventually gets the battleship hyperion as he his given command of the 13th fleet, and this becomes his flagship during the coming conflic&shy;ts.\

 although he participated in the coup, greenhill did have personal doubts about his cause, and one of his reasons for betraying the government was so that he could control the other members of the coup and prevent as much bloodshed as possible. throughout the crisis, greenhill tried to moderate the actions of his subordinates, often unsuccessfully.\
 his coup took early success, gaining over half of the alliance's surviving forces. however, his coup crumbled because of incompetence and yang wen-li's resistance. his plan to assassinate yang wen-li not only failed, but the assassin, commander bagdashu, publicly announced that the coup was a subversion by reinhard von lohengramm, though yang did not have solid proof of this. this, combined with the massacre of protestors at a rally, destroyed the council's public relations. after the defeat of the 11th fleet at the battle of doria most of the remaining neutral or nsmc alliance military forces defected to yang wen li's side, leaving the council stranded on heinessen. greenhill was ready to admit defeat when yang wen-li destroyed the artemis necklace. when given the option of using the people of heinessen as hostages greenhill, in horror and disgust, refused to do so, preferring to let the nation heal from the civil war as quickly as possible. intending to take his own life, greenhill then confronted lynch. lynch, having confessed that he had instigated the coup under duke lohengramm's orders, then killed greenhill in a shootout between the two men.\
 tragically, greenhill's coup d'&eacute;tat would bring about the opposite of what he sought to do. not only did the corrupt government remain in power and the alliance lose another of its remaining fleets, but the actions of the renegade military units completely turned public opinion against the military, destroying the last of its independence from political control. far from reviving a weakened alliance, greenhill and his group only served to weaken it even further, a situation which would directly lead to its demise only a few years later.\

 catching the 11th off-guard, yang succeeded in cutting it in half, and dusty attemborough's squadron was sent to occupy the forward forces under stokes. that stokes' forces continued forward for quite some time was presumably due to the sudden loss of communications.\
 eventually realizing the situation, stokes turned to aid legrage, but attemborough's forces attacked fiercely, convincing him to turn and engage the smaller force first. unknown to stokes, he played right into yang's hands. attemborough mostly stayed just out of reach, only attacking when stokes would begin to turn back towards the main battle. this way, stokes was kept away from legrange, who was defeated.\
 eventually, the rest of yang's forces joined attemborough's squadron, critically outgunning and outnumbering stokes's forces. despite yang's repeated offers of surrender, stokes refused to relent, and was lost with the rest of the 11th fleet.\

 mikuru asahina, a shy and timid girl with a childish na&iuml;vet&eacute;, is the only character other than kyon to be brought into the sos brigade against her will. she is defined by kyon to be extremely cute, and is often sexually harassed by haruhi suzumiya.\
 \
 she is in fact a time traveller from the future with the purpose of observing haruhi during the course of the story line.\
 considered one of the most beautiful girls in high school mikuru is as kind, caring and thoughtful as she is beautiful. she easily gets scared or flustered, and is apparently prone to daydreaming as she can also be rather clumsy at times. nevertheless, she can be surprisingly resilient and is capable of recovering from even the most discomforting of situations. however, because of her gentle nature she seems rather helpless most of the time. kyon sees it as his duty to always watch over and protect her, although, when it comes to haruhi there is no rescue.\
 \
 mikuru is the designated \"mascot\" of the sos brigade, serving as a way to attract interest and members by using her attractive physical qualities&mdash;her cute face, trim figure, and noticeably sizable bust. she was \"voluntarily arrested\" by haruhi, who deemed it necessary to have an alluring lolita type in the club. her sex appeal and innocence is often exploited by haruhi to procure resources. mikuru is on a regular occasion forced to wear any outfits that haruhi buys for her. haruhi also sees it fit that mikuru is unable to dress and undress by herself most times and often does it for her, much to mikuru's considerable&mdash;and vocal&mdash;distress. so far, mikuru has worn the following outfits: maid, waitress, nurse, frog costume, cheerleader, miko, and the infamous bunny-girl.\
 \
 the name \"mikuru (みくる)\" is derived from \"miku\" which when written in kanji is \"mirai (未来)\" (\"future\" in japanese).\

 itsuki is the last member to have joined the sos brigade, having been recruited by haruhi as a \"mysterious transfer student.\"\
 \
 itsuki was sent to observe and keep haruhi emotionally stable, in order to protect the rest of humanity. although he is an esper, which is exactly one of the sorts of people haruhi desires to meet, itsuki never reveals himself as such, at least, not to her.\
 itsuki is constantly smiling and always speaks in a formal and polite manner. he is also prone to giving long and detailed explanations, usually illustrated by exaggerated hand gestures. itsuki has confirmed to kyon once that his outer personality is merely an artificial image he fakes in accordance to haruhi's impression of him, and hints that his true character is something quite different, being \"less pleasing\" in the eyes of others. maintaining his casual, constantly smiling self, however, is vital for keeping haruhi's mentality balanced.\
 \
 out of the three brigade members, kyon is the least fond of itsuki. he often finds himself annoyed with itsuki's plastic smile, his willingness to acquiesce to haruhi's outrageous schemes, playful teasing and his various forays into his psychological and philosophical theories (e.g., omphalos hypothesis, anthropic principle, etc.). he is also distrustful of itsuki's intentions, comparing him to yuki nagato when it comes to deciphering his expressions. itsuki's fondness for speculation often causes him to produce explanations for situations involving the sos brigade, its members and related events. ironically, itsuki can only share his theories with kyon and also enthusiastically plays different kinds of board games with him to pass the time, despite losing all the time, although kyon suspects that he may be doing so on purpose.\
 \
 despite the theory he advances in which haruhi is the equivalent of god, itsuki says that there are many differing lines of speculation about haruhi within \"the agency.\" itsuki himself does not believe in a singular god, nor does he regard haruhi as such, although he reveals that he has colleagues that do. apparently, most of the questions that he raises about haruhi's true nature are philosophical in nature and do not necessarily represent his personal beliefs. itsuki also reveals that the majority of \"the agency\" advocates observing haruhi instead of doing anything that might provoke her.\
 in the disappearance arc, the altered koizumi reveals that he has a crush on haruhi. this does not necessarily mean that the real koizumi harbors such feelings, but it is possible that he would have feelings for her if kyon would not be haruhi's love interest.\
 in the astonishment arc, koizumi is revealed to be the leader and founder of the agency. furthermore, he reveals part of his true personality when he blows up at the aliens and time travelers for meddling. more or less, he threatens war against both factions should they continuing tampering with haruhi. koizumi also says that he is a part of haruhi's subconscious made physical, although he never explains what he means more fully. he seems especially suspicious of the time travelers, particularly asahina (adult).\

 \
 yuki nagato is a quiet high school freshman that is the only member of the sos brigade that was not \"voluntarily arrested,\" or coerced into joining, by haruhi suzumiya. when haruhi claimed the empty literature club as the sos brigade's clubroom, yuki was found reading there. haruhi claimed the clubroom and yuki as part of the brigade, both of which she didn't mind. she lives alone in the same apartment complex as ryoko asakura. she wears glasses and her school uniform at all times, only discarding the former after kyon babbled that she was cuter without them and that he wasn't a 'glasses man', and the latter when the sos brigade went on vacation.\
 \
 yuki is a \"humanoid interface,\" or artificial human, created by the integrated data entity for the purposes of interacting with and observing events on earth. specifically, she is assigned to observe haruhi, who is the cause of an explosion of data that occurred when she used her godlike powers to recreate the world three years prior.\
 \
 as an artificial human, she has numerous paranormal abilities. she is capable of manipulating the properties of the environment and any materials within it at any scale to her desire, referred to as \"bogus magic\" by kyon. for instance, she can create a baseball bat that only hits home runs, nullify data links (removing other artificial interface connections from their bodies), plus she is able to make a cover up story (since ryoko was gone, she made a cover up story that she moved to canada), and reconstruct a classroom, down to the last detail, after everything in it was completely destroyed. as a result, she is capable of feats of superhuman strength, agility, and stamina. in one instance, she was unfazed while impaled by multiple metal spikes, and effortlessly reconstructed her body afterwards. her state also affords her an extreme level of intelligence. she can comprehend the rules and concepts of a game instantaneously, as well as create flawless strategies based on her observations, and was able to learn how to play a guitar mere moments after receiving one.\
 \
 yuki has a very stoic and introverted personality, preferring simple body language rather than speaking. when prompted to speak, she does so in a very concise manner, always speaking in a monotone and displaying a dispassionate complexion. she thinks very rationally, and finds it difficult to communicate with normal humans due to her intelligence and lack of empathy. she enjoys reading, and is seen reading a book in the majority of her appearances. as the series continues, she develops a sense of humor, although her unchanging facial expressions make it near-impossible to discern whether she is joking or not. despite her reserved manner, she is reliable and trustworthy, resulting in kyon trusting her more than other members of the sos brigade.\
 \
 yuki is described by haruhi as the sos brigade's \"indispensable silent character.\" she was neither recruited by nor did she join the brigade but was actually included along with the room when haruhi arrived and declared it as her own. whenever she is in the club room, she is usually reading. similar to itsuki koizumi, yuki is obedient when orders are given; however, her loyalties lie more with kyon rather than haruhi. the other members often rely on yuki and her abilities whenever needed most, notably when the sos brigade was losing in the baseball tournament, the contest against the computer society, and in the case of the cave cricket. aside from this role, she is also responsible for kyon's safety, as evident when she saved him from an attack by ryōko, since kyon's presence stabilizes haruhi's emotions.\
 \
 in the sos brigade's amateur movie production the adventures of mikuru asahina, yuki was cast as the leading antagonist. she was portrayed as an alien, who could also use magic.\
 \
 kyon also realized after the \"cave cricket\" incident that yuki plays a \"behind the scenes\" role, making her one of the puppeteers whose goals are to ensure haruhi is fully satisfied and that order and balance are maintained. her intentions of being in the brigade are to monitor haruhi and prevent her from feeling bored or greatly disappointed because it is generally believed by the integrated data entity that a drastic event that could end the universe would occur. it is also believed that haruhi is also the key to evolution and thus it is important for yuki and other humanoid interfaces to continue their observations. she also has the ability to detect any spatial changes in the environment caused by haruhi and will act to prevent them from persisting. an example of this is during the unscripted attack in the first fight scene of the brigade movie, when she tackled mikuru in order to remove her contact lens which had temporarily caused the fictional \"mikuru beam\" to become real.\

 blood type: ab\
 occupation: student (grade 10-11), ultra director, ultra detective, brigade chief and founder\
 \
 background\
 haruhi suzumiya, a first year student at north high school (in novels 1-8), and second year (in the 9th and latest novel), can be characterized as funny, eccentric, and somewhat unpredictable. in the series, she is introduced declaring her interests in aliens, espers and time travelers and does not care for \"ordinary\" human beings. the last thing on her mind is a normal high school life. with a burning desire to find such phenomena in the world, she is generally unapproachable and finds ordinary people boring and uninteresting. as a result of this, many of her classmates choose to avoid and confront her. she deals with her emotions by creating a parallel universe, where she inadvertently releases transparent creatures who tear up and destroy everything that comes into contact with them. espers are the ones who can stop these creatures by cutting and destroying them, because if these creatures are left alone destroying everything as well as the outer barrier it could affect the outside world. she also likes to dress up mikuru in random outfits.\
 \
 kyon is the first character to engage with her in a serious conversation. from this encounter, she gradually begins to soften up to others and starts to open up with her classmates. later on, haruhi took kyon against his will and forced him to help her start the sos brigade, thus she has taken an unknown interests to kyon later in the series. it is hinted that one of the reasons as to why haruhi opened up to kyon was that he resembled john smith; john smith and kyon are the same person.\
 \
 she is noted as smart, athletic, and naturally talented in any extra-curricular activities. she once joined every activity club in her school and quit because she found them boring, despite pleas by the club members for her membership. her musical talent was highlighted when she stood in as the emergency lead singer and guitarist, along with yuki, for the band enoz during the school festival.\
 \
 her childhood is cited as an originator for her interests in strange phenomena. while attending a baseball game with her family, she was shocked to see the vast number of people who had come to see the game. before then, she had often thought of herself and her life as being special and interesting, yet then came to realize that they were just ordinary normal occurrences and habits and that she is just one of many living human in all of japan in which japan is just part of earth. consequently, she believed then that there must be at least one person in the world who is living an interesting and truly unique life and sought out to effectively be that person thus motivating her to seek out the extraordinary.\
 \
 after this realization she became notorious in middle school for doing odd things which included painting strange hieroglyphs all over the school grounds using a field marker and placing all the school desks in the halls. additionally, she accepted and rejected every guy who had ever asked her out, the longest lasting a week and the shortest being five minutes. she only seeks relationships with aliens, espers, and time travelers. this shows the depth of her interest in finding non-humans and strange phenomena.\
 in actuality, haruhi is believed to be either a crack in the space-time continuum, the first technological singularity to be spontaneously born in the universe, or some sort of deity, depending on point of view. this belief stems from a massive spontaneous universal event that occurred three years prior to haruhi meeting kyon, of which haruhi is said to be the cause. the event attracted the attention of three prominent groups: the extraterrestrial integrated data entity, time travelers from a distant future, and a group of espers known as the \"agency.\"\
 \
 her powers which are capable of altering, creating, or destroying reality are triggered by her emotions and inner desires. it's been theorized by the espers that the current universe may be just one in a string that haruhi had subconsciously created. in order to relieve stress whenever she becomes too emotionally unstable, patches of alternate dimension referred to as \"closed space\" are created and within resides gigantic blue entities that destroy the surrounding area. despite having these powers haruhi is completely oblivious to them or the existence of aliens, time travelers, and espers.\
 personality\
 at first, haruhi seems very indifferent and cold but underneath that front she is very spontaneous, upbeat, and hyperactive. her determination, persistence, and resourcefulness drive her endeavors of finding strange phenomenon and promoting the sos brigade. because of her dedication, she becomes hot-headed when things don't go her way. hand-in-hand with her cleverness and creativity, and a certain ruthlessness, even seeming amorality, she can often get what she wants, an example of such is when she blackmailed the computer society president into giving her a brand new computer for the sos brigade. haruhi tends to pursue her goals regardless of who gets in the way, or is hurt, such as mikuru in the aforementioned blackmail. she also has a tendency to be jealous and angry when kyon gets too friendly with any girl. evidently, the universe was almost destroyed and recreated when haruhi's jealousy was pushed too far.\
 \
 haruhi also has a very competitive personality and accepts without hesitation any challenge that crosses her, regardless of difficulty or time constraint. her constant optimism and over-confidence make her seem arrogant. she has very high standards and won't accept anything less than perfection from herself and her brigade. she places a lot of trust in her brigade members, especially kyon, to get the task done whatever it may be. this can sometimes make her seem selfish and unkind.\
 \
 she is not shy and often attracts a lot of attention to the point of not minding changing clothes in front of various people, more so when her sos brigade is in mind. when it comes to mikuru she is very physically playful. she often comments on mikuru's attractiveness and seems to find a kind of enjoyment in exploiting it to her own ends, often through forcing mikuru into and out of various costumes such as a bunny girl costume as if she were a human dress-up doll.\
 \
 haruhi also seems to hate showing signs of vulnerability to others. following her concert performance at the school's culture festival when she and yuki filled in for two members of the band enoz, haruhi showed awkwardness toward the band members when they thanked her the following day. as kyon pointed out, haruhi was not used to receiving praise from others because of how mischievous she regularly acts toward others because of her abnormal interests.\
 \
 though many of haruhi's efforts are devoted to finding supernatural beings, she does not actually believe in them. this is suggested by itsuki during the first light novel, that haruhi does not force himself, yuki, or mikuru to reveal themselves because her commonsense will not let her believe that they exist. in fact, between the first and second light novels, when kyon tries to convince haruhi that the other sos brigade members are more than they appear, she does not believe him. later, she bases the adventures of mikuru asahina on kyon's story.\
 \
 sos brigade role\
 haruhi is the founder and \"brigade chief\" of the sos brigade, or saving the world by overloading it with fun haruhi suzumiya brigade. she was unable to find any existing club suitable to her preferences. she made the group in order to find and have fun with aliens, espers, and time travelers. upon creation, she names herself as its leader. her method of finding and recruiting members is to \"voluntarily arrest\" them then force them to join.\
 \
 the sos brigade is very precious to her and has stated to kyon that she has no intention of yielding her position as chief to anyone else. she will go to any lengths, even by exploiting the members, to bring attention and support for her brigade such as procuring room and materials, maintaining their website, participating in sports tournaments, organizing activities such as city-wide searches for strange phenomenon among other things. she wrote, produced, and directed the brigade's amateur-movie the adventures of mikuru asahina for the school festival.\
 \
 however, unbeknownst to her is the true purpose of the sos brigade: to prevent haruhi from becoming bored, as her boredom would bring about the end of the world as the sos brigade's members know it. kyon also happens to be a very important person in her life. for whatever reason, haruhi \"chose\" kyon. this is first said by yuki, then restated by mikuru, and itsuki as well. she often relies on and trusts kyon with anything. kyon is the only person whom she has been open with, and when she briefly created a \"new world,\" he was the only person she had brought over from the \"old world.\" these are all made evident in the fourth novel the vanishment of haruhi suzumiya, where she remained at kyon's side for the three days he was in a coma due to a small accident; however, he is apparently worth far more to her than even she realizes. unknown to her, the person she knew as john smith, who \"helped\" her draw weird symbols at the schoolyard of east junior high (her old school) at night on tanabata three years prior, is in fact, kyon from the present time, sent back in time. furthermore, his time there unintentionally created an alternate timeline where no sos brigade existed, yuki, mikuru, ryoko, itsuki, and haruhi were normal humans and the latter two never transferred to north high, thus no sos brigade. only by going back to that night again was kyon able to set things right. finally, should kyon reveal to haruhi that he is john smith, it would radically change everything, as he stated to the integrated data entity through yuki.\

 however, it turns out that she is yuki's backup, and as such, is also another \"humanoid interface.\" much like yuki, she finds it difficult to empathize with humans, but unlike yuki, possesses exceptional social skills. initially she cheerfully supports kyon's reaching out to haruhi, often encouraging him to \"open her up to the class,\" making haruhi easier to observe. however, she later decides to try and kill kyon with a combat knife in the hopes of catalyzing an observable reaction from haruhi. her efforts are stopped, after yuki defeated and removed her from the physical world. it's interesting to note that her cheerful personality doesn't falter, even at the moment of her own demise. afterwards, yuki fabricated a cover story that she moved to canada.\
 \
 ryouko makes a reappearance in the disappearance arc, on an alternate timeline in which haruhi never attends north high or forms an sos brigade. in this timeline she is just a normal human and is very kind to the shy nagato; however, this ryoko's timeline is obssesed with her; when she seemingly sees kyon trying to shoot nagato with a gun, she stabs him with a knife, believing that this is what yuki wanted, it was briefly shown that ryoko may show feelings for nagato and would do anything to protect her.\
 in the astonishment arc, ryouko takes her rightful place as nagato's backup since nagato became ill. while she still wishes to kill kyon (and even goes to far as to tell him this with a smile on her face), she ironically saves him twice from kuyou. kyon made the decision that she should not enroll at north high again (as he doesn't want to provoke haruhi) which she agrees to. ryouko is currently unable to attack kyon because emiri was given special counter-measures against ryouko's attacks. because of this, ryouko is actually a bit of an ally to kyon at this point.\

 he has a passion for computers and has, with the other four members of the computer society, developed their own basic science-fiction strategy game titled the day of sagittarius iii (there is no day of sagittarius i or ii, they just thought the iii would sound cool). he later challenges the sos brigade to a rigged contest using their game, betting four of his club's laptops in an attempt to reclaim the originally pilfered computer. despite the research society's cheating, yuki counters by reprogramming the code in-match, and the sos brigade wins. despite the loss of four additional laptops, the president was at least overjoyed at having discovered a genius computer hacker that would participate in his club's activities. in the light novels, it is hinted he is one of nagato's secret admirers.\

 famous quote: <i>\"this world isn&rsquo;t worth saving. tragedy and sadness will never truly disappear.\"</i>\
 \
 homura is a magical girl who first appears in an apocalyptic nightmare of madoka's. she transfers into her school the day after the dream. she is a beautiful, mysterious individual that performs exceptionally well in academics and athletics. this makes her instantly popular even though she is cold to others.\
 \
 she seems to know madoka well and wishes to prevent her from becoming a magical girl. she attacks kyubey in the first episode, only to be stopped by mami.\
 \
 homura's cold personality developed from repeating the same timeline again and again. she was originally a shy, weak transfer student who spent a long time in hospital due to a heart disease. she was befriended and eventually saved from a witch by madoka, who revealed that she was a magical girl. when madoka was killed in her battle with walpurgisnacht, homura contracted with kyubey to become a person that could protect her. she became a magical girl with the ability to manipulate time, allowing her to return to her first meeting with madoka in order to change her fate. she tries again and again to prevent madoka from being killed or becoming a magical girl and, inevitably, a witch, but is never able to save her. she always returns to the beginning of the month upon failure.\
 \
 her magical weapon is a shield filled with sand that allows her to freeze time. however, this power becomes useless if she is physically restrained as she cannot turn her shield to activate it. she can also use this shield to block projectiles and store the various weapons she carries. since her shield and magic have no offensive capability, she instead attacks using stolen firearms and homemade explosives while time is stopped. once the sand on her shield runs out, homura must reset the timeline.\
 rebellion spoiler\
 in rebellion, homura extracts madoka's human form from law of cycles and then rewrites the world. she calls herself \"devil,\" though her power comes not from grief but from love. she creates a new timeline where madoka transfers to homura's school and sayaka and momoe nagisa are alive.\
 \
 she is nicknamed \"akuma (devil) homura\" by fans.\

 a 14-year-old girl whose life changes when she encounters the puella magi homura and the familiar kyubey, who offers to transform her into a puella magi herself. she sees herself as a person without special qualities or talents, and after seeing mami fighting against witches, wants to be a wonderful and cool puella magi like her.  she is a rather selfless girl who wishes to be a magical girl simply so that she can help others. she allegedly has a large amount of magical potential within her. \
 \
 following mami's death, she becomes uncertain about becoming a puella magi, becoming more so as the dark secrets of the puella magi are revealed to her. she is kind, gentle, averse to fighting, and wishes that everyone would get along, sometimes even putting her own life at risk to help others. in previous timelines that homura had experienced, madoka had become a puella magi, wielding a magic bow and arrow. according to kyubey, she is capable of becoming the strongest puella magi and the most terrible witch, capable of destroying the world, which is why he is most interested in forming a contract with her.\
 at the beginning of the 3rd movie she is trapped inside homura's tainted soul gem, in false mitakihara. her memories are gone and she is fighting \"nightmares\" with the other 4 girls. during the finale, she regains her memories and godlike powers, but they are partially stolen by akemi homura to rewrite the world where madoka can live as a human while law of cycles is still working. her (and other magical girls') memories are rewritten by homura, and in that world madoka is the transfer student, who is greeted and guided by homura.\

 he is a familiar who can grant any wish to a certain girl, on the condition that she becomes a puella magi and fights against witches.\
 \
 when someone makes a contract with him, he extracts their soul and places it inside a soul gem, replacing their body with a shell that's more resilient to fighting witches.\
 \
 he has made contracts with mami, kyoko, homura, and sayaka, and shows particular interest in making madoka a puella magi. \
 \
 it is unknown if there are other familiars besides him. he can only be seen or heard by puella magi and those who have potential to become a puella magi. he also disposes of used grief seeds for the puella magi, because, if they are used too extensively, the witch could become reborn from the grief seed. he also constantly tries to find chances to persuade girls who have potential to become puella magi to form a contract with him, despite the fact that he knows the dangers that puella magi face. much to his dismay, he cannot force a girl to become a puella magi.\
 \
 he doesn't fully understand human values and questions any perceived differences between himself and humans. for example, when madoka claims that he is cruel for forming contracts with girls and turning them into puella magi, he compares his actions to the act of humans slaughtering livestock, saying that, unlike humans, who show a lack of interest and sympathy for other creatures' values when it comes to their own survival, he at least recognizes humans as being sentient beings and tries to negotiate with them. therefore, kyuubey is neither evil nor good, just a survivor like everyone else.\
 \
 <b>major spoiler:</b> kyuubey is an \"incubator\" and from an advanced alien species whose civilization is located far away from earth. a long time ago, his species took alarm to the gradual heat death of the universe, and, in their search for a solution to it, encountered a species on earth, humans, who exhibited emotions, something kyuubey's species does not have. they then subsequently discovered a type of energy called emotional energy that could be used efficiently counter entropy, and also realized that teenage human females, who are very emotionally unstable during their mental and physical development throughout puberty, harbor the most emotional energy of all humans.\
 \
 therefore, it is kyuubey's duty to form contracts with teenage girls and to collect the emotional energy that is created when the girl becomes a puella magi. however, it is also his duty to collect the massive amount of emotional energy that is created when a puella magi transforms into a witch, and to consume grief seeds, which also contain large amounts of emotional energy.\

 it seems that negative emotions such as hatred and despair yield more emotional energy than positive emotions, since kyuubey comments that the amount of emotional energy created when a girl becomes a puella magi is nothing compared to the explosion of emotional energy created when a puella magi transforms into a witch. thus, it could be said that kyuubey's main purpose is to \"incubate\" girls' souls in soul gems until they become filled with so much negative emotion that they transform into grief seeds and \"hatch\" into witches, and to then \"harvest\" the emotional energy created from the transformation.\
 \
 also, whenever kyuubey is killed, he is instantly reincarnated (for lack of a better word) into a new body with the same appearance and disposes of his previous body by eating it. he seems to have an endless supply of spare bodies, so, it might not be possible to kill him in a conventional fashion.\

 madoka's classmate who, after helping madoka rescue kyubey, ends up getting an offer to become a puella magi herself. she cares deeply for her friends, and wants to help an ill boy named kyousuke kamijou, whom she has a crush on. before becoming a puella magi, sayaka wields a baseball bat that mami can enhance with magic to defend herself with while on witch hunts. \
 \
 in order to cure kyosuke's hand, which was damaged in an accident which robbed him of his ability to play the violin, she becomes a puella magi. sayaka's weapon of choice is a sword. she also has regenerative powers stronger than anyone else due to the nature of her wish. sayaka hates people who think only of themselves whilst hurting others and is easily provoked into a fight. \
 \
 after learning how puella magi are created, sayaka starts to descend into despair, as she believes she's now no better than a zombie and thus cannot openly admit her love for kyousuke. her state of mind only worsens as one of her two best friends, hitomi, confesses that she has feelings for kyousuke too and makes advances on him. at the same time, she also refuses to purify her soul gem with grief seeds and neglects it to become tainted. at the end of episode 8, her soul gem was finally exhausted, and sayaka turns into the witch oktavia von seckendorff. she dies in a battle with sakura kyouko, who sacrifices herself in order to not let sayaka die alone. \
 \
 in episode 10, it's revealed that during akemi homura's third time loop, sayaka also suffered the same fate of turning into a witch, and was killed by homura with an explosive.\

 kyouko is a veteran magical girl who comes to the city later in the story. a girl with red-colored long hair and an equally fiery personality to match. amusingly, she is always seen eating something, even while she is battling.  \
 \
 she came from a poor church family and used her wish so that people would listen to her father's preaching; when her father learned of this, however, he went mad and killed everyone in his family aside from kyouko. as such, kyouko decided only to use her magic for herself from this point on, since using it for others will only cause despair.\
 having grown up in a poor family, she often has to steal food and hates people who waste it, a logic she also applies to grief seeds, as she only goes after fully grown witches.\
 \
 kyouko has been a puella magi much longer than the others, and thus is more skillful; she wields a spear which can extend itself, split into multiple sections, and produce a ball at the end of a chain, which can constrict and hit others at the same time. she also has the ability to put up barriers to protect others or keep them from interfering. \
 she initially clashes with sayaka, but after learning the truth about soul gems, she sympathizes with her and tries to help her. \
 \
 after sayaka becomes a witch, she becomes determined to save her and restore her to normal, but ultimately sacrifices herself in the fight so that sayaka would not die alone. she overloads her soul gem to create a massive explosion that kills them both. \
 \
 in a previous timeline, she was killed by mami, who was driven insane after learning that they would all eventually become witches. \
 \
 in the final timeline, kyouko survives, and grieves over sayaka's death in battle. \
 \
 in the third drama cd, it is explained that, prior to the main storyline, kyouko once had the power to utilize illusion magic, but after her family's death she subconsciously lost that ability. she also had a friendship with mami prior to her family's death, which was severed when kyouko decided to be more selfish with her magic. this friendship was also explored in oriko magica, though not in-depth.\
 her relationship with mami is thoroughly explained in the different story, showing in depth the events mentioned in the drama cd and it is also shown that her previous mentor-apprentice relationship with mami is the reason of her coming to mitagawa city. this occurs before homura's checkpoint, so it's supposedly a constant and remains true as her motives for retuning to the city in the anime as well.\
 \
 at some point in the different story manga kyouko also comes in terms with her past and regains a fraction of her illusion magic, which she uses to fool mami into believing she had cleansed her soul gem and allows her to live. after defeating oktavia and truly cleansing mami's soul gem, kyouko dies in her fight with another witch while trying to get a grief seed for herself.\

 mami is a veteran magical girl and a third-year student at madoka's school. she lives alone in a penthouse after the death of her parents in a car accident, one which she was able to survive only due to contracting with kyubey to save her own life. \
 \
 mami is particularly focused on saving those around her, with a traditionally selfless perspective on the role of magical girl, and has a habit of giving names to her finishing attacks. though her outward disposition is cheery and confident, mami feels deeply alone as she has no friends to confide in or support her as she fights. \
 \
 madoka offers to become her partner and save her from her loneliness, but mami is killed immediately after during battle with a witch; as per madoka's wish, at the close of the final timeline, this witch never existed, and mami is therefore seen, alive, with kyoko and homura at the end of the series. according to kyubey, she never knew the darker truths concerning soul gems and origins of witches. in a previous timeline, learning of these truths drove mami insane and she attempted to murder the remaining magical girls to prevent them from becoming witches, and in the oriko magica timeline, she contemplates letting herself be killed and/or committing suicide so she doesn't become a witch herself.\
